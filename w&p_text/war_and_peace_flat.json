    "text": "“Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the\r\n      Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if\r\n      you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\r\n      Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have\r\n      nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my\r\n      ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have\r\n      frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna\r\n      Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With\r\n      these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and\r\n      importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna\r\n      had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering fromla\r\n      grippe; grippebeing then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by\r\n      the elite.\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by\r\n      a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n“If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect\r\n      of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be\r\n      very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Schérer.”\n“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least\r\n      disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\r\n      embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his\r\n      breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined\r\n      French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the\r\n      gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had\r\n      grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her\r\n      hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and\r\n      complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n“First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at\r\n      rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\r\n      affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n“Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\r\n      these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are staying the\r\n      whole evening, I hope?”\n“And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put\r\n      in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is coming for me to\r\n      take me there.”\n“I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities\r\n      and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”\n“If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\r\n      put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\r\n      said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n“Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s\r\n      dispatch? You know everything.”\n“What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone.\r\n      “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his\r\n      boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”\nPrince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale\r\n      part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years,\r\n      overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had\r\n      become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like\r\n      it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of\r\n      those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her\r\n      faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled\r\n      child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither\r\n      wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst\r\n      out:\n“Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand things, but\r\n      Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us!\r\n      Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high\r\n      vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in!\r\n      Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth,\r\n      and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will\r\n      fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become\r\n      more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We\r\n      alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we\r\n      rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot\r\n      understand the Emperor Alexander’s loftiness of soul. She has refused to\r\n      evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in\r\n      our actions. What answer did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not\r\n      understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who\r\n      wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what\r\n      have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will\r\n      not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible,\r\n      and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a word\r\n      that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality\r\n      is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our\r\n      adored monarch. He will save Europe!”\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n“I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been sent\r\n      instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of\r\n      Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup\r\n      of tea?”\n“In a moment.À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am\r\n      expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who\r\n      is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best\r\n      French families. He is one of the genuineémigrés, the good ones.\r\n      And also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been\r\n      received by the Emperor. Had you heard?”\n“I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But tell me,” he\r\n      added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,\r\n      though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit,\r\n      “is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed\r\n      first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.”\nPrince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were\r\n      trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for the\r\n      baron.\nAnna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor\r\n      anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was\r\n      pleased with.\n“Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,”\r\n       was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an\r\n      expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\r\n      sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\r\n      patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funkebeaucoup\r\n      d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and\r\n      courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna wished both\r\n      to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to\r\n      the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:\n“Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out\r\n      everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.”\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n“I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the\r\n      prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social\r\n      topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation—“I\r\n      often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why\r\n      has fate given you two such splendid children? I don’t speak of Anatole,\r\n      your youngest. I don’t like him,” she added in a tone admitting of no\r\n      rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. “Two such charming children. And\r\n      really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don’t deserve to\r\n      have them.”\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n“I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I lack the\r\n      bump of paternity.”\n“Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am\r\n      dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and her face\r\n      assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s and\r\n      you were pitied....”\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting\r\n      a reply. He frowned.\n“What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all a father\r\n      could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte\r\n      is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only\r\n      difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way more natural and\r\n      animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly\r\n      revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.\n“And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father\r\n      there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna Pávlovna,\r\n      looking up pensively.\n“I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children\r\n      are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I\r\n      explain it to myself. It can’t be helped!”\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture.\r\n      Anna Pávlovna meditated.\n“Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she asked.\r\n      “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don’t feel\r\n      that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy\r\n      with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.”\nPrince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and\r\n      perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the\r\n      head that he was considering this information.\n“Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current\r\n      of his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year?\r\n      And,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in five years, if he goes\r\n      on like this?” Presently he added: “That’s what we fathers have to put up\r\n      with.... Is this princess of yours rich?”\n“Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the\r\n      well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under the late\r\n      Emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.’ He is very clever but\r\n      eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I\r\n      think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp\r\n      of Kutúzov’s and will be here tonight.”\n“Listen, dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pávlovna’s\r\n      hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange that affair for me\r\n      and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafewith anf,\r\n      as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good\r\n      family and that’s all I want.”\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the\r\n      maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he\r\n      lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\n“Attendez,”said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to Lise,\r\n      young Bolkónski’s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be\r\n      arranged. It shall be on your family’s behalf that I’ll start my\r\n      apprenticeship as old maid.”"

    "text": "Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg\r\n      society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character\r\n      but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vasíli’s\r\n      daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take her father to the\r\n      ambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of\r\n      honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya, known asla femme la\r\n      plus séduisante de Pétersbourg, * was also there. She had been married\r\n      during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large\r\n      gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vasíli’s son, Hippolyte,\r\n      had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbé Morio and many\r\n      others had also come.\n* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.\nTo each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen my aunt,”\r\n       or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted him or her to a\r\n      little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come\r\n      sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and\r\n      slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pávlovna\r\n      mentioned each one’s name and then left them.\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one\r\n      of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared\r\n      about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn\r\n      interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same\r\n      words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty,\r\n      “who, thank God, was better today.” And each visitor, though politeness\r\n      prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of\r\n      relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the\r\n      whole evening.\nThe young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered\r\n      velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was\r\n      just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more\r\n      sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to\r\n      meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive\r\n      woman, her defect—the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open\r\n      mouth—seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty.\r\n      Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to\r\n      become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so\r\n      lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after\r\n      being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they\r\n      too were becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to\r\n      her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her\r\n      white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.\nThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps,\r\n      her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a\r\n      sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to\r\n      herself and to all around her. “I have brought my work,” said she in\r\n      French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. “Mind, Annette, I\r\n      hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,” she added, turning to her\r\n      hostess. “You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just\r\n      see how badly I am dressed.” And she spread out her arms to show her\r\n      short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad\r\n      ribbon just below the breast.\n“Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone\r\n      else,” replied Anna Pávlovna.\n“You know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in\r\n      French, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He is going to\r\n      get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?” she added,\r\n      addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she turned to\r\n      speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.\n“What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince Vasíli to\r\n      Anna Pávlovna.\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with\r\n      close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at\r\n      that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young\r\n      man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known grandee of\r\n      Catherine’s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet\r\n      entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned\r\n      from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance\r\n      in society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the\r\n      lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade\r\n      greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too\r\n      large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre\r\n      enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the\r\n      room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but\r\n      observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone\r\n      else in that drawing room.\n“It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor\r\n      invalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt\r\n      as she conducted him to her.\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as\r\n      if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little\r\n      princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.\nAnna Pávlovna’s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt\r\n      without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty’s health. Anna\r\n      Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “Do you know the Abbé\r\n      Morio? He is a most interesting man.”\n“Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very\r\n      interesting but hardly feasible.”\n“You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something and get\r\n      away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a\r\n      reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had\r\n      finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who\r\n      wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he\r\n      began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s plan chimerical.\n“We will talk of it later,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.\nAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she\r\n      resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to\r\n      help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the\r\n      foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round\r\n      and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or\r\n      makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set\r\n      it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room,\r\n      approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight\r\n      rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and\r\n      regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident.\r\n      She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round\r\n      Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed\r\n      to another group whose center was the abbé.\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pávlovna’s was\r\n      the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual\r\n      lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop,\r\n      did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation\r\n      that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on\r\n      the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very\r\n      profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed\r\n      interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own\r\n      views, as young people are fond of doing."

    "text": "Anna Pávlovna’s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily\r\n      and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside whom\r\n      sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out\r\n      of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into\r\n      three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbé. Another,\r\n      of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Hélène, Prince\r\n      Vasíli’s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkónskaya, very pretty and\r\n      rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered\r\n      round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished\r\n      manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of\r\n      politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which\r\n      he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to\r\n      her guests. As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a specially choice\r\n      delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would\r\n      have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the\r\n      vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about\r\n      Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d’Enghien.\r\n      The vicomte said that the Duc d’Enghien had perished by his own\r\n      magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte’s\r\n      hatred of him.\n“Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna, with a\r\n      pleasant feeling that there was somethingà la Louis XVin the\r\n      sound of that sentence:“Contez nous çela, Vicomte.”\nThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to\r\n      comply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to\r\n      listen to his tale.\n“The vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to one of\r\n      the guests. “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said she to another.\r\n      “How evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she to a third; and\r\n      the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most\r\n      advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot\r\n      dish.\nThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.\n“Come over here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful young\r\n      princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.\nThe princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which\r\n      she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful\r\n      woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy,\r\n      with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she\r\n      passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them\r\n      but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of\r\n      admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom—which\r\n      in the fashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed\r\n      to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna\r\n      Pávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of\r\n      coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable\r\n      and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to\r\n      diminish its effect.\n“How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his\r\n      shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary\r\n      when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her\r\n      unchanging smile.\n“Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he, smilingly\r\n      inclining his head.\nThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a\r\n      reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was being\r\n      told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in\r\n      shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom,\r\n      on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed\r\n      the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she\r\n      glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on\r\n      the maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.\nThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.\n“Wait a moment, I’ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?”\r\n       she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. “Fetch me my workbag.”\nThere was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily\r\n      to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.\n“Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took\r\n      up her work.\nPrince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving\r\n      a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.\nLe charmant Hippolytewas surprising by his extraordinary\r\n      resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in\r\n      spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like\r\n      his sister’s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,\r\n      self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the\r\n      wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was\r\n      dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence,\r\n      while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed\r\n      puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell\r\n      into unnatural positions.\n“It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside the\r\n      princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this\r\n      instrument he could not begin to speak.\n“Why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging his\r\n      shoulders.\n“Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which\r\n      showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had\r\n      uttered them.\nHe spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure\r\n      whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a\r\n      dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color ofcuisse de nymphe\r\n      effrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.\nThe vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,\r\n      to the effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit\r\n      Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also\r\n      enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence Napoleon\r\n      happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject,\r\n      and was thus at the duc’s mercy. The latter spared him, and this\r\n      magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.\nThe story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where\r\n      the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked\r\n      agitated.\n“Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little\r\n      princess.\n“Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her\r\n      work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story\r\n      prevented her from going on with it.\nThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared\r\n      to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on\r\n      the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly\r\n      and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had\r\n      managed to start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power,\r\n      and the latter, evidently interested by the young man’s simple-minded\r\n      eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening\r\n      too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved.\n“The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the\r\n      people,” the abbé was saying. “It is only necessary for one powerful\r\n      nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place\r\n      herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object\r\n      the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the\r\n      world!”\n“But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning.\nAt that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,\r\n      asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian’s face\r\n      instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression,\r\n      evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.\n“I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the\r\n      society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the\r\n      honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the\r\n      climate,” said he.\nNot letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more\r\n      conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger\r\n      circle."

    "text": "Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew\r\n      Bolkónski, the little princess’ husband. He was a very handsome young man,\r\n      of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from\r\n      his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most\r\n      striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not\r\n      only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so\r\n      tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all\r\n      these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as\r\n      that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that\r\n      distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up\r\n      his eyes scanned the whole company.\n“You are off to the war, Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna.\n“General Kutúzov,” said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing the last\r\n      syllable of the general’s name like a Frenchman, “has been pleased to take\r\n      me as an aide-de-camp....”\n“And Lise, your wife?”\n“She will go to the country.”\n“Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”\n“André,”said his wife, addressing her husband in the same\r\n      coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has been\r\n      telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!”\nPrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the\r\n      moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,\r\n      affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round\r\n      Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was\r\n      touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre’s beaming face he gave him an\r\n      unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.\n“There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?” said he to Pierre.\n“I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre. “I will come to supper with\r\n      you. May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who\r\n      was continuing his story.\n“No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre’s hand\r\n      to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say\r\n      something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his daughter got up\r\n      to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.\n“You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,” said Prince Vasíli to the Frenchman,\r\n      holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising.\r\n      “This unfortunate fete at the ambassador’s deprives me of a pleasure, and\r\n      obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your enchanting\r\n      party,” said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.\nHis daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly holding\r\n      up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her\r\n      beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened,\r\n      eyes as she passed him.\n“Very lovely,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Very,” said Pierre.\nIn passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’s hand and said to Anna Pávlovna:\r\n      “Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and\r\n      this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary\r\n      for a young man as the society of clever women.”\n\nAnna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his\r\n      father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’s. The elderly lady who had\r\n      been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasíli\r\n      in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left\r\n      her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.\n“How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him into the\r\n      anteroom. “I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I\r\n      may take back to my poor boy.”\nAlthough Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the\r\n      elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating\r\n      and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.\n“What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be\r\n      transferred to the Guards at once?” said she.\n“Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,” answered Prince\r\n      Vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise\r\n      you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That would be the\r\n      best way.”\nThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the best\r\n      families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of society\r\n      had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to\r\n      Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son. It\r\n      was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an\r\n      invitation to Anna Pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening to the\r\n      vicomte’s story. Prince Vasíli’s words frightened her, an embittered look\r\n      clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled\r\n      again and clutched Prince Vasíli’s arm more tightly.\n“Listen to me, Prince,” said she. “I have never yet asked you for anything\r\n      and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father’s\r\n      friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God’s sake to do this for my\r\n      son—and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,” she added\r\n      hurriedly. “No, don’t be angry, but promise! I have asked Golítsyn and he\r\n      has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,” she said, trying to\r\n      smile though tears were in her eyes.\n“Papa, we shall be late,” said Princess Hélène, turning her beautiful head\r\n      and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by\r\n      the door.\nInfluence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if\r\n      it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized that if\r\n      he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to\r\n      ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in Princess\r\n      Drubetskáya’s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms\r\n      of conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been\r\n      indebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he\r\n      could see by her manners that she was one of those women—mostly\r\n      mothers—who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until\r\n      they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on\r\n      insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This\r\n      last consideration moved him.\n“My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and\r\n      weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but\r\n      to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father’s memory, I will\r\n      do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here\r\n      is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?”\n“My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you—I knew your\r\n      kindness!” He turned to go.\n“Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...”\r\n       she faltered. “You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich Kutúzov ...\r\n      recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...”\nPrince Vasíli smiled.\n“No, I won’t promise that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is pestered since\r\n      his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the\r\n      Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.”\n“No, but do promise! I won’t let you go! My dear benefactor...”\n“Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, “we shall\r\n      be late.”\n“Well,au revoir!Good-by! You hear her?”\n“Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?”\n“Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t promise.”\n“Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he went, with\r\n      the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally\r\n      to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.\nApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all\r\n      the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed\r\n      its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the group where\r\n      the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while\r\n      waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was accomplished."

    "text": "“And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?”\r\n       asked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca\r\n      laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte\r\n      sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations? Adorable!\r\n      It is enough to make one’s head whirl! It is as if the whole world had\r\n      gone crazy.”\nPrince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic\r\n      smile.\n“‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’’* They say he was very\r\n      fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in Italian:“‘Dio\r\n      mi l’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’’\n* God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!\n“I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over,”\r\n       Anna Pávlovna continued. “The sovereigns will not be able to endure this\r\n      man who is a menace to everything.”\n“The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte, polite but\r\n      hopeless: “The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII,\r\n      for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became more\r\n      animated. “And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal\r\n      of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to\r\n      compliment the usurper.”\nAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.\nPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through\r\n      his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little\r\n      princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé coat of\r\n      arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she\r\n      had asked him to do it.\n“Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé,”said he.\nThe princess listened, smiling.\n“If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,” the vicomte\r\n      continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better\r\n      acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the\r\n      current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too far. By intrigues,\r\n      violence, exile, and executions, French society—I mean good French\r\n      society—will have been forever destroyed, and then....”\nHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to make\r\n      a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna, who had\r\n      him under observation, interrupted:\n“The Emperor Alexander,” said she, with the melancholy which always\r\n      accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, “has declared\r\n      that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own\r\n      form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper, the\r\n      whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful\r\n      king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.\n“That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew. “Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly\r\n      supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will be\r\n      difficult to return to the old regime.”\n“From what I have heard,” said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the\r\n      conversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to\r\n      Bonaparte’s side.”\n“It is the Buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without\r\n      looking at Pierre. “At the present time it is difficult to know the real\r\n      state of French public opinion.”\n“Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile.\nIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks\r\n      at him, though without looking at him.\n“‘I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,’” Prince\r\n      Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon’s words.\r\n      “‘I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.’ I do not know how far he\r\n      was justified in saying so.”\n“Not in the least,” replied the vicomte. “After the murder of the duc even\r\n      the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some people,” he\r\n      went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero, after the murder\r\n      of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on\r\n      earth.”\nBefore Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation\r\n      of the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and\r\n      though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she\r\n      was unable to stop him.\n“The execution of the Duc d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre, “was a\r\n      political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of\r\n      soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that\r\n      deed.”\n“Dieu! Mon Dieu!”muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.\n“What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows\r\n      greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work\r\n      nearer to her.\n“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed several voices.\n“Capital!” said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee\r\n      with the palm of his hand.\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his\r\n      audience over his spectacles and continued.\n“I say so,” he continued desperately, “because the Bourbons fled from the\r\n      Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood\r\n      the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good, he could not\r\n      stop short for the sake of one man’s life.”\n“Won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested Anna Pávlovna.\nBut Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.\n“No,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “Napoleon is great because\r\n      he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all\r\n      that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom of speech\r\n      and of the press—and only for that reason did he obtain power.”\n“Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit\r\n      murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him a\r\n      great man,” remarked the vicomte.\n“He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid\r\n      them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man. The\r\n      Revolution was a grand thing!” continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by\r\n      this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish\r\n      to express all that was in his mind.\n“What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But\r\n      won’t you come to this other table?” repeated Anna Pávlovna.\n“Rousseau’sContrat Social,” said the vicomte with a tolerant\r\n      smile.\n“I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.”\n“Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an\r\n      ironical voice.\n“Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important.\r\n      What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and\r\n      equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full\r\n      force.”\n“Liberty and equality,” said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last\r\n      deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were,\r\n      “high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love\r\n      liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have\r\n      people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted\r\n      liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.”\nPrince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte\r\n      and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of Pierre’s\r\n      outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-struck.\r\n      But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the\r\n      vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she\r\n      rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the\r\n      orator.\n“But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,” said she, “how do you explain the fact of\r\n      a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is\r\n      innocent and untried?”\n“I should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains the 18th\r\n      Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like\r\n      the conduct of a great man!”\n“And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!” said the\r\n      little princess, shrugging her shoulders.\n“He’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked Prince Hippolyte.\nPierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His\r\n      smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, his\r\n      grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another—a\r\n      childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask\r\n      forgiveness.\nThe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this\r\n      young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were silent.\n“How do you expect him to answer you all at once?” said Prince Andrew.\r\n      “Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his\r\n      acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor. So it seems to\r\n      me.”\n“Yes, yes, of course!” Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this\r\n      reinforcement.\n“One must admit,” continued Prince Andrew, “that Napoleon as a man was\r\n      great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave\r\n      his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts which it\r\n      is difficult to justify.”\nPrince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of\r\n      Pierre’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go.\nSuddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,\r\n      and asking them all to be seated began:\n“I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it. Excuse\r\n      me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost....”\r\n       And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a\r\n      Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia. Everyone\r\n      waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his\r\n      story.\n“There is in Moscow a lady,une dame, and she is very stingy. She\r\n      must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her\r\n      taste. And she had a lady’s maid, also big. She said....”\nHere Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with\r\n      difficulty.\n“She said.... Oh yes! She said, ‘Girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a livery, get\r\n      up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.’”\nHere Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his\r\n      audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several\r\n      persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pávlovna, did however smile.\n“She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and her\r\n      long hair came down....” Here he could contain himself no longer and went\r\n      on, between gasps of laughter: “And the whole world knew....”\nAnd so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told\r\n      it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the\r\n      others appreciated Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably ending\r\n      Pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote the\r\n      conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and\r\n      next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and\r\n      where."

    "text": "Having thanked Anna Pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to\r\n      take their leave.\nPierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red\r\n      hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and\r\n      still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly\r\n      agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-minded. When he\r\n      rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general’s three-cornered\r\n      hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to\r\n      restore it. All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and\r\n      converse in it was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest\r\n      expression. Anna Pávlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness\r\n      that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: “I hope\r\n      to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear\r\n      Monsieur Pierre.”\nWhen she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody\r\n      saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, “Opinions are opinions,\r\n      but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.” And everyone,\r\n      including Anna Pávlovna, felt this.\nPrince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to\r\n      the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently\r\n      to his wife’s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the\r\n      hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and\r\n      stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.\n“Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,” said the little princess, taking\r\n      leave of Anna Pávlovna. “It is settled,” she added in a low voice.\nAnna Pávlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she\r\n      contemplated between Anatole and the little princess’ sister-in-law.\n“I rely on you, my dear,” said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low tone. “Write\r\n      to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter.Au revoir!”—and she left the hall.\nPrince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face\r\n      close to her, began to whisper something.\nTwo footmen, the princess’ and his own, stood holding a shawl and a cloak,\r\n      waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to the French\r\n      sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of understanding but\r\n      not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual spoke smilingly and\r\n      listened with a laugh.\n“I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador’s,” said Prince Hippolyte “—so\r\n      dull—. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!”\n“They say the ball will be very good,” replied the princess, drawing up\r\n      her downy little lip. “All the pretty women in society will be there.”\n“Not all, for you will not be there; not all,” said Prince Hippolyte\r\n      smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he even\r\n      pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from\r\n      awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the\r\n      shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as\r\n      though embracing her.\nStill smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her\r\n      husband. Prince Andrew’s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he\r\n      seem.\n“Are you ready?” he asked his wife, looking past her.\nPrince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion\r\n      reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch\r\n      following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.\n“Princesse, au revoir,”cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well\r\n      as with his feet.\nThe princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark\r\n      carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under\r\n      pretense of helping, was in everyone’s way.\n“Allow me, sir,” said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable\r\n      tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.\n“I am expecting you, Pierre,” said the same voice, but gently and\r\n      affectionately.\nThe postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte\r\n      laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte\r\n      whom he had promised to take home.\n“Well,mon cher,” said the vicomte, having seated himself beside\r\n      Hippolyte in the carriage, “your little princess is very nice, very nice\r\n      indeed, quite French,” and he kissed the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte\r\n      burst out laughing.\n“Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,”\r\n       continued the vicomte. “I pity the poor husband, that little officer who\r\n      gives himself the airs of a monarch.”\nHippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, “And you were\r\n      saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to\r\n      know how to deal with them.”\nPierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew’s study like one\r\n      quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from\r\n      the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar’sCommentaries),\r\n      and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.\n“What have you done to Mlle Schérer? She will be quite ill now,” said\r\n      Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands.\nPierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager\r\n      face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.\n“That abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right\r\n      light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but—I do not\r\n      know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....”\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract\r\n      conversation.\n“One can’t everywhere say all one thinks,mon cher. Well, have you\r\n      at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a\r\n      diplomatist?” asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.\nPierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.\n“Really, I don’t yet know. I don’t like either the one or the other.”\n“But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.”\nPierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor, and\r\n      had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow his\r\n      father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man, “Now go to\r\n      Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to\r\n      anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasíli, and here is money. Write to\r\n      me all about it, and I will help you in everything.” Pierre had already\r\n      been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on anything.\r\n      It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed\r\n      his forehead.\n“But he must be a Freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé whom he had\r\n      met that evening.\n“That is all nonsense.” Prince Andrew again interrupted him, “let us talk\r\n      business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?”\n“No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell\r\n      you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom I\r\n      could understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help\r\n      England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right.”\nPrince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre’s childish words. He\r\n      put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense,\r\n      but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the\r\n      one Prince Andrew gave to this naïve question.\n“If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,”\r\n       he said.\n“And that would be splendid,” said Pierre.\nPrince Andrew smiled ironically.\n“Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....”\n“Well, why are you going to the war?” asked Pierre.\n“What for? I don’t know. I must. Besides that I am going....” He paused.\r\n      “I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!”"

    "text": "The rustle of a woman’s dress was heard in the next room. Prince Andrew\r\n      shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in\r\n      Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The\r\n      princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and\r\n      elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for\r\n      her.\n“How is it,” she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and\r\n      fussily in the easy chair, “how is it Annette never got married? How\r\n      stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so,\r\n      but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are,\r\n      Monsieur Pierre!”\n“And I am still arguing with your husband. I can’t understand why he wants\r\n      to go to the war,” replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of\r\n      the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with\r\n      young women.\nThe princess started. Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the quick.\n“Ah, that is just what I tell him!” said she. “I don’t understand it; I\r\n      don’t in the least understand why men can’t live without wars. How is it\r\n      that we women don’t want anything of the kind, don’t need it? Now you\r\n      shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncle’s\r\n      aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well known, so much\r\n      appreciated by everyone. The other day at the Apráksins’ I heard a lady\r\n      asking, ‘Is that the famous Prince Andrew?’ I did indeed.” She laughed.\r\n      “He is so well received everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to\r\n      the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette\r\n      and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?”\nPierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the\r\n      conversation, gave no reply.\n“When are you starting?” he asked.\n“Oh, don’t speak of his going, don’t! I won’t hear it spoken of,” said the\r\n      princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to\r\n      Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the\r\n      family circle of which Pierre was almost a member. “Today when I\r\n      remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ...\r\n      and then you know, André...” (she looked significantly at her husband)\r\n      “I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.\nHer husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides\r\n      Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid\r\n      politeness.\n“What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don’t understand,” said he.\n“There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of\r\n      his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in\r\n      the country.”\n“With my father and sister, remember,” said Prince Andrew gently.\n“Alone all the same, withoutmyfriends.... And he expects me not\r\n      to be afraid.”\nHer tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a joyful,\r\n      but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it\r\n      indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the\r\n      matter lay in that.\n“I still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said Prince Andrew\r\n      slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.\nThe princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.\n“No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....”\n“Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said Prince Andrew. “You had\r\n      better go.”\nThe princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.\r\n      Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.\nPierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him and now\r\n      at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.\n“Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?” exclaimed the little\r\n      princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful\r\n      grimace. “I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so\r\n      to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity\r\n      for me. Why is it?”\n“Lise!” was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an\r\n      entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret\r\n      her words. But she went on hurriedly:\n“You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave\r\n      like that six months ago?”\n“Lise, I beg you to desist,” said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.\nPierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all\r\n      this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight\r\n      of tears and was ready to cry himself.\n“Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you I\r\n      myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me! An\r\n      outsider is out of place here.... No, don’t distress yourself....\r\n      Good-by!”\nPrince Andrew caught him by the hand.\n“No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the\r\n      pleasure of spending the evening with you.”\n“No, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without restraining\r\n      her angry tears.\n“Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which\r\n      indicates that patience is exhausted.\nSuddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess’ pretty face\r\n      changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes\r\n      glanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid,\r\n      deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its\r\n      drooping tail.\n“Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!”she muttered, and lifting her dress with one\r\n      hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.\n“Good night, Lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he\r\n      would have done to a stranger."

    "text": "The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre\r\n      continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead\r\n      with his small hand.\n“Let us go and have supper,” he said with a sigh, going to the door.\nThey entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.\r\n      Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore\r\n      that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.\r\n      Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,\r\n      with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on\r\n      his face, began to talk—as one who has long had something on his\r\n      mind and suddenly determines to speak out.\n“Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That’s my advice: never marry till\r\n      you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and\r\n      until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her\r\n      plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake.\r\n      Marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is good and\r\n      noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes!\r\n      Yes! Don’t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything\r\n      from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all\r\n      is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged\r\n      side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what’s the good?...”\r\n       and he waved his arm.\nPierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the\r\n      good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in\r\n      amazement.\n“My wife,” continued Prince Andrew, “is an excellent woman, one of those\r\n      rare women with whom a man’s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not\r\n      give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention\r\n      this, because I like you.”\nAs he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkónski who\r\n      had lolled in Anna Pávlovna’s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had\r\n      uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face\r\n      was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of\r\n      life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It was\r\n      evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more\r\n      impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.\n“You don’t understand why I say this,” he continued, “but it is the whole\r\n      story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,” said he (though\r\n      Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), “but Bonaparte when he worked went\r\n      step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to\r\n      consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a\r\n      chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and\r\n      strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. Drawing\r\n      rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality—these are the enchanted\r\n      circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the greatest war\r\n      there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very\r\n      amiable and have a caustic wit,” continued Prince Andrew, “and at Anna\r\n      Pávlovna’s they listen to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife\r\n      cannot exist, and those women.... If you only knew what those society\r\n      women are, and women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain,\r\n      stupid, trivial in everything—that’s what women are when you see\r\n      them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if\r\n      there were something in them, but there’s nothing, nothing, nothing! No,\r\n      don’t marry, my dear fellow; don’t marry!” concluded Prince Andrew.\n“It seems funny to me,” said Pierre, “thatyou, youshould consider\r\n      yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have everything\r\n      before you, everything. And you....”\nHe did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought\r\n      of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.\n“How can he talk like that?” thought Pierre. He considered his friend a\r\n      model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree\r\n      just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described\r\n      as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew’s calm\r\n      manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive\r\n      reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about\r\n      everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if\r\n      Pierre was often struck by Andrew’s lack of capacity for philosophical\r\n      meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded\r\n      even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength.\nEven in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and\r\n      commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that\r\n      they may run smoothly.\n“My part is played out,” said Prince Andrew. “What’s the use of talking\r\n      about me? Let us talk about you,” he added after a silence, smiling at his\r\n      reassuring thoughts.\nThat smile was immediately reflected on Pierre’s face.\n“But what is there to say about me?” said Pierre, his face relaxing into a\r\n      careless, merry smile. “What am I? An illegitimate son!” He suddenly\r\n      blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say\r\n      this. “Without a name and without means... And it really...” But he did\r\n      not say what “it really” was. “For the present I am free and am all right.\r\n      Only I haven’t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you\r\n      seriously.”\nPrince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance—friendly and\r\n      affectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own superiority.\n“I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our whole\r\n      set. Yes, you’re all right! Choose what you will; it’s all the same.\r\n      You’ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting those\r\n      Kurágins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badly—all\r\n      this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!”\n“What would you have, my dear fellow?” answered Pierre, shrugging his\r\n      shoulders. “Women, my dear fellow; women!”\n“I don’t understand it,” replied Prince Andrew. “Women who arecomme il\r\n      faut, that’s a different matter; but the Kurágins’ set of women,\r\n      ‘women and wine’ I don’t understand!”\nPierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin’s and sharing the dissipated\r\n      life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by\r\n      marrying him to Prince Andrew’s sister.\n“Do you know?” said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought,\r\n      “seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I\r\n      can’t decide or think properly about anything. One’s head aches, and one\r\n      spends all one’s money. He asked me for tonight, but I won’t go.”\n“You give me your word of honor not to go?”\n“On my honor!”"

    "text": "It was past one o’clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless,\r\n      northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive\r\n      straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the\r\n      impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to\r\n      see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or\r\n      evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kurágin was\r\n      expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was\r\n      generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very\r\n      fond of.\n“I should like to go to Kurágin’s,” thought he.\nBut he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there.\r\n      Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately\r\n      once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he\r\n      decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to\r\n      Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already\r\n      promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; “besides,” thought he,\r\n      “all such ‘words of honor’ are conventional things with no definite\r\n      meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or\r\n      something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will\r\n      be all the same!” Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort,\r\n      nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kurágin’s.\nReaching the large house near the Horse Guards’ barracks, in which Anatole\r\n      lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in\r\n      at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks,\r\n      and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds\r\n      of voices and shouting in the distance.\nCards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre\r\n      threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains\r\n      of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly\r\n      what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter,\r\n      the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general\r\n      commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an\r\n      open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him\r\n      by the chain and trying to set him at the others.\n“I bet a hundred on Stevens!” shouted one.\n“Mind, no holding on!” cried another.\n“I bet on Dólokhov!” cried a third. “Kurágin, you part our hands.”\n“There, leave Bruin alone; here’s a bet on.”\n“At one draught, or he loses!” shouted a fourth.\n“Jacob, bring a bottle!” shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who\r\n      stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen\r\n      shirt unfastened in front. “Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is Pétya!\r\n      Good man!” cried he, addressing Pierre.\nAnother voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,\r\n      particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring,\r\n      cried from the window: “Come here; part the bets!” This was Dólokhov, an\r\n      officer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was\r\n      living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.\n“I don’t understand. What’s it all about?”\n“Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,” said Anatole,\r\n      and taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.\n“First of all you must drink!”\nPierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the\r\n      tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to\r\n      their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre’s glass while explaining\r\n      that Dólokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he\r\n      would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor\r\n      window with his legs hanging out.\n“Go on, you must drink it all,” said Anatole, giving Pierre the last\r\n      glass, “or I won’t let you go!”\n“No, I won’t,” said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the\r\n      window.\nDólokhov was holding the Englishman’s hand and clearly and distinctly\r\n      repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole\r\n      and Pierre.\nDólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He was\r\n      about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that\r\n      his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The\r\n      lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper\r\n      lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and\r\n      something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two\r\n      corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent\r\n      intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not\r\n      to notice his face. Dólokhov was a man of small means and no connections.\r\n      Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dólokhov lived with\r\n      him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them,\r\n      including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole.\r\n      Dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won. However much he\r\n      drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kurágin and Dólokhov were\r\n      at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.\nThe bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone\r\n      from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who\r\n      were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of\r\n      the gentlemen around.\nAnatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to\r\n      smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but\r\n      could not move it. He smashed a pane.\n“You have a try, Hercules,” said he, turning to Pierre.\nPierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with a\r\n      crash.\n“Take it right out, or they’ll think I’m holding on,” said Dólokhov.\n“Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?” said Anatole.\n“First-rate,” said Pierre, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottle of rum\r\n      in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky,\r\n      the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.\nDólokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window\r\n      sill. “Listen!” cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room.\r\n      All were silent.\n“I bet fifty imperials”—he spoke French that the Englishman might\r\n      understand him, but he did not speak it very well—“I bet fifty\r\n      imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?” added he, addressing\r\n      the Englishman.\n“No, fifty,” replied the latter.\n“All right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum\r\n      without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot”\r\n       (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) “and\r\n      without holding on to anything. Is that right?”\n“Quite right,” said the Englishman.\nAnatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of\r\n      his coat and looking down at him—the Englishman was short—began\r\n      repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.\n“Wait!” cried Dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to\r\n      attract attention. “Wait a bit, Kurágin. Listen! If anyone else does the\r\n      same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?”\nThe Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to\r\n      accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though he\r\n      kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating\r\n      Dólokhov’s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life\r\n      Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill,\r\n      leaned over, and looked down.\n“Oh! Oh! Oh!” he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of\r\n      the pavement.\n“Shut up!” cried Dólokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad\r\n      jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.\nPlacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,\r\n      Dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his\r\n      legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on\r\n      his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the\r\n      left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed them\r\n      on the window sill, though it was already quite light. Dólokhov’s back in\r\n      his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone\r\n      crowded to the window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but\r\n      silent. One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward\r\n      with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dólokhov’s shirt.\n“I say, this is folly! He’ll be killed,” said this more sensible man.\nAnatole stopped him.\n“Don’t touch him! You’ll startle him and then he’ll be killed. Eh?... What\r\n      then?... Eh?”\nDólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged\r\n      himself on his seat.\n“If anyone comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words separately\r\n      through his thin compressed lips, “I will throw him down there. Now then!”\nSaying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and\r\n      lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to\r\n      balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken\r\n      glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window\r\n      and from Dólokhov’s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The\r\n      Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished\r\n      to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa\r\n      with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile\r\n      forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were\r\n      still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dólokhov still sat in the same\r\n      position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair\r\n      touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted\r\n      higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying\r\n      perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back.\r\n      “Why is it so long?” thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half\r\n      an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement with his\r\n      spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his\r\n      whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping\r\n      down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved\r\n      as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre\r\n      again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again.\r\n      Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dólokhov was\r\n      standing on the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.\n“It’s empty.”\nHe threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. Dólokhov\r\n      jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.\n“Well done!... Fine fellow!... There’s a bet for you!... Devil take you!”\r\n       came from different sides.\nThe Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.\r\n      Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the window\r\n      sill.\n“Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I’ll do the same thing!” he\r\n      suddenly cried. “Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a\r\n      bottle. I’ll do it.... Bring a bottle!”\n“Let him do it, let him do it,” said Dólokhov, smiling.\n“What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go\r\n      giddy even on a staircase,” exclaimed several voices.\n“I’ll drink it! Let’s have a bottle of rum!” shouted Pierre, banging the\r\n      table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of\r\n      the window.\nThey seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who\r\n      touched him was sent flying.\n“No, you’ll never manage him that way,” said Anatole. “Wait a bit and I’ll\r\n      get round him.... Listen! I’ll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are all\r\n      going to ——’s.”\n“Come on then,” cried Pierre. “Come on!... And we’ll take Bruin with us.”\nAnd he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,\r\n      and began dancing round the room with it."

    "text": "Prince Vasíli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskáya who\r\n      had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Borís on the evening of Anna\r\n      Pávlovna’s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception\r\n      made, and Borís transferred into the regiment of Semënov Guards with the\r\n      rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment to Kutúzov’s staff\r\n      despite all Anna Mikháylovna’s endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna\r\n      Pávlovna’s reception Anna Mikháylovna returned to Moscow and went straight\r\n      to her rich relations, the Rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the town\r\n      and where her darling Bóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the\r\n      line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been\r\n      educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had\r\n      already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had\r\n      remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to\r\n      Radzivílov.\nIt was St. Natalia’s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs—the\r\n      mother and the youngest daughter—both named Nataly. Ever since the\r\n      morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually,\r\n      bringing visitors to the Countess Rostóva’s big house on the Povarskáya,\r\n      so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and her handsome eldest\r\n      daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to\r\n      congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.\nThe countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type of\r\n      face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had had twelve. A\r\n      languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a\r\n      distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikháylovna\r\n      Drubetskáya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the\r\n      drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young\r\n      people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to\r\n      take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw them\r\n      off, inviting them all to dinner.\n“I am very, very grateful to you,mon cher,” or“ma chère”—he\r\n      called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in\r\n      his tone, “my dear,” whether they were above or below him in rank—“I\r\n      thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are\r\n      keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended,ma chère!On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come,mon cher!” These\r\n      words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the\r\n      same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm\r\n      pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had\r\n      seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the\r\n      drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out\r\n      his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who\r\n      enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity,\r\n      offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health,\r\n      sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French;\r\n      then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty,\r\n      he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over\r\n      his bald patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from\r\n      the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the\r\n      large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty\r\n      people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china,\r\n      moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call Dmítri\r\n      Vasílevich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and\r\n      while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say: “Well,\r\n      Dmítri, you’ll see that things are all as they should be? That’s right!\r\n      The great thing is the serving, that’s it.” And with a complacent sigh he\r\n      would return to the drawing room.\n“Márya Lvóvna Karágina and her daughter!” announced the countess’ gigantic\r\n      footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The countess\r\n      reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her\r\n      husband’s portrait on it.\n“I’m quite worn out by these callers. However, I’ll see her and no more.\r\n      She is so affected. Ask her in,” she said to the footman in a sad voice,\r\n      as if saying: “Very well, finish me off.”\nA tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling\r\n      daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.\n“Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ... at the\r\n      Razumóvski’s ball ... and Countess Apráksina ... I was so delighted...”\r\n       came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and\r\n      mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs. Then one\r\n      of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the\r\n      guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, “I am so delighted...\r\n      Mamma’s health... and Countess Apráksina...” and then, again rustling,\r\n      pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The\r\n      conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy\r\n      and celebrated beau of Catherine’s day, Count Bezúkhov, and about his\r\n      illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna\r\n      Pávlovna’s reception.\n“I am so sorry for the poor count,” said the visitor. “He is in such bad\r\n      health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!”\n“What is that?” asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor\r\n      alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count\r\n      Bezúkhov’s distress some fifteen times.\n“That’s what comes of a modern education,” exclaimed the visitor. “It\r\n      seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he\r\n      liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things\r\n      that he has been expelled by the police.”\n“You don’t say so!” replied the countess.\n“He chose his friends badly,” interposed Anna Mikháylovna. “Prince\r\n      Vasíli’s son, he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said, been up to\r\n      heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it. Dólokhov has\r\n      been degraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov’s son sent back to Moscow. Anatole\r\n      Kurágin’s father managed somehow to get his son’s affair hushed up, but\r\n      even he was ordered out of Petersburg.”\n“But what have they been up to?” asked the countess.\n“They are regular brigands, especially Dólokhov,” replied the visitor. “He\r\n      is a son of Márya Ivánovna Dólokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just\r\n      fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and\r\n      set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere,\r\n      and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to\r\n      back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear\r\n      swimming about with the policeman on his back!”\n“What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!” shouted the\r\n      count, dying with laughter.\n“Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?”\nYet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.\n“It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,” continued the visitor.\r\n      “And to think it is Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s son who amuses himself\r\n      in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and\r\n      clever. This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope\r\n      that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his money. They\r\n      wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have my daughters\r\n      to consider.”\n“Why do you say this young man is so rich?” asked the countess, turning\r\n      away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. “His\r\n      children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate.”\nThe visitor made a gesture with her hand.\n“I should think he has a score of them.”\nPrincess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently\r\n      wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society.\n“The fact of the matter is,” said she significantly, and also in a half\r\n      whisper, “everyone knows Count Cyril’s reputation.... He has lost count of\r\n      his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.”\n“How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!” remarked the\r\n      countess. “I have never seen a handsomer man.”\n“He is very much altered now,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Well, as I was\r\n      saying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the count is\r\n      very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor\r\n      about him; so that in the case of his death—and he is so ill that he\r\n      may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburg—no\r\n      one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince Vasíli.\r\n      Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very well for\r\n      Prince Vasíli told me himself. Besides, Cyril Vladímirovich is my mother’s\r\n      second cousin. He’s also my Bóry’s godfather,” she added, as if she\r\n      attached no importance at all to the fact.\n“Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on some\r\n      inspection business,” remarked the visitor.\n“Yes, but between ourselves,” said the princess, “that is a pretext. The\r\n      fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladímirovich, hearing how ill he\r\n      is.”\n“But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,” said the count; and\r\n      seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young\r\n      ladies. “I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!”\nAnd as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form\r\n      again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats\r\n      well and, in particular, drinks well. “So do come and dine with us!” he\r\n      said."

    "text": "Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but\r\n      not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose\r\n      and took their leave. The visitor’s daughter was already smoothing down\r\n      her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the\r\n      next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door\r\n      and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding\r\n      something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped\r\n      short in the middle of the room. It was evident that she had not intended\r\n      her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared a\r\n      student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of\r\n      fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.\nThe count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide\r\n      and threw them round the little girl who had run in.\n“Ah, here she is!” he exclaimed laughing. “My pet, whose name day it is.\r\n      My dear pet!”\n“Ma chère, there is a time for everything,” said the countess with\r\n      feigned severity. “You spoil her, Ilyá,” she added, turning to her\r\n      husband.\n“How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day,”\r\n       said the visitor. “What a charming child,” she added, addressing the\r\n      mother.\nThis black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life—with\r\n      childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice,\r\n      with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in\r\n      lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers—was just at that\r\n      charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet\r\n      a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face\r\n      in the lace of her mother’s mantilla—not paying the least attention\r\n      to her severe remark—and began to laugh. She laughed, and in\r\n      fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced\r\n      from the folds of her frock.\n“Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...” was all Natásha managed to\r\n      utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against her mother and\r\n      burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor\r\n      could not help joining in.\n“Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,” said the mother,\r\n      pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the\r\n      visitor she added: “She is my youngest girl.”\nNatásha, raising her face for a moment from her mother’s mantilla, glanced\r\n      up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.\nThe visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it\r\n      necessary to take some part in it.\n“Tell me, my dear,” said she to Natásha, “is Mimi a relation of yours? A\r\n      daughter, I suppose?”\nNatásha did not like the visitor’s tone of condescension to childish\r\n      things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.\nMeanwhile the younger generation: Borís, the officer, Anna Mikháylovna’s\r\n      son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count’s eldest son; Sónya, the\r\n      count’s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Pétya, his youngest boy, had\r\n      all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain\r\n      within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all\r\n      their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out\r\n      so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing\r\n      room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apráksina. Now\r\n      and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their\r\n      laughter.\nThe two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,\r\n      were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Borís\r\n      was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate\r\n      features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. Dark\r\n      hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed\r\n      impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing\r\n      room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed. Borís on\r\n      the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously\r\n      how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady,\r\n      before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had\r\n      known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having\r\n      said this he glanced at Natásha. She turned away from him and glanced at\r\n      her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with\r\n      suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped\r\n      up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry\r\n      her. Borís did not laugh.\n“You were meaning to go out, weren’t you, Mamma? Do you want the\r\n      carriage?” he asked his mother with a smile.\n“Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,” she answered, returning his\r\n      smile.\nBorís quietly left the room and went in search of Natásha. The plump boy\r\n      ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been disturbed."

    "text": "The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the\r\n      young lady visitor and the countess’ eldest daughter (who was four years\r\n      older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were\r\n      Nicholas and Sónya, the niece. Sónya was a slender little brunette with a\r\n      tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black\r\n      plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion\r\n      and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms\r\n      and neck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility\r\n      of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she\r\n      reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a\r\n      beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an\r\n      interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself\r\n      her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to\r\n      join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could\r\n      not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the\r\n      kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play\r\n      with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natásha and Borís, escape\r\n      from the drawing room.\n“Ah yes, my dear,” said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to\r\n      Nicholas, “his friend Borís has become an officer, and so for friendship’s\r\n      sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father, and entering the\r\n      military service, my dear. And there was a place and everything waiting\r\n      for him in the Archives Department! Isn’t that friendship?” remarked the\r\n      count in an inquiring tone.\n“But they say that war has been declared,” replied the visitor.\n“They’ve been saying so a long while,” said the count, “and they’ll say so\r\n      again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear, there’s\r\n      friendship for you,” he repeated. “He’s joining the hussars.”\nThe visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.\n“It’s not at all from friendship,” declared Nicholas, flaring up and\r\n      turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. “It is not from friendship\r\n      at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.”\nHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both\r\n      regarding him with a smile of approbation.\n“Schubert, the colonel of the Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us today.\r\n      He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him. It can’t\r\n      be helped!” said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully\r\n      of a matter that evidently distressed him.\n“I have already told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you don’t wish to\r\n      let me go, I’ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army;\r\n      I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.—I don’t know how to hide\r\n      what I feel.” As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a\r\n      handsome youth at Sónya and the young lady visitor.\nThe little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to\r\n      start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.\n“All right, all right!” said the old count. “He always flares up! This\r\n      Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose from\r\n      an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,” he added, not\r\n      noticing his visitor’s sarcastic smile.\nThe elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karágina turned to young\r\n      Rostóv.\n“What a pity you weren’t at the Arkhárovs’ on Thursday. It was so dull\r\n      without you,” said she, giving him a tender smile.\nThe young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile,\r\n      and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at\r\n      all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of Sónya,\r\n      who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced\r\n      round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to\r\n      restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got\r\n      up and left the room. All Nicholas’ animation vanished. He waited for the\r\n      first pause in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the\r\n      room to find Sónya.\n“How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!”\r\n       said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.“Cousinage—dangereux\r\n      voisinage,”* she added.\n* Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.\n“Yes,” said the countess when the brightness these young people had\r\n      brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one\r\n      had put but which was always in her mind, “and how much suffering, how\r\n      much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now!\r\n      And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is always,\r\n      always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls\r\n      and boys.”\n“It all depends on the bringing up,” remarked the visitor.\n“Yes, you’re quite right,” continued the countess. “Till now I have\r\n      always, thank God, been my children’s friend and had their full\r\n      confidence,” said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who\r\n      imagine that their children have no secrets from them. “I know I shall\r\n      always be my daughters’ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his\r\n      impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can’t help it), he will\r\n      all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.”\n“Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,” chimed in the count, who\r\n      always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that\r\n      everything was splendid. “Just fancy: wants to be an hussar. What’s one to\r\n      do, my dear?”\n“What a charming creature your younger girl is,” said the visitor; “a\r\n      little volcano!”\n“Yes, a regular volcano,” said the count. “Takes after me! And what a\r\n      voice she has; though she’s my daughter, I tell the truth when I say\r\n      she’ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to give\r\n      her lessons.”\n“Isn’t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at\r\n      that age.”\n“Oh no, not at all too young!” replied the count. “Why, our mothers used\r\n      to be married at twelve or thirteen.”\n“And she’s in love with Borís already. Just fancy!” said the countess with\r\n      a gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently concerned with a\r\n      thought that always occupied her: “Now you see if I were to be severe with\r\n      her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the\r\n      sly” (she meant that they would be kissing), “but as it is, I know every\r\n      word she utters. She will come running to me of her own accord in the\r\n      evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems\r\n      the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter.”\n“Yes, I was brought up quite differently,” remarked the handsome elder\r\n      daughter, Countess Véra, with a smile.\nBut the smile did not enhance Véra’s beauty as smiles generally do; on the\r\n      contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression.\r\n      Véra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was\r\n      well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and\r\n      appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone—the visitors and countess\r\n      alike—turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and\r\n      they all felt awkward.\n“People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make\r\n      something exceptional of them,” said the visitor.\n“What’s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too clever\r\n      with Véra,” said the count. “Well, what of that? She’s turned out\r\n      splendidly all the same,” he added, winking at Véra.\nThe guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.\n“What manners! I thought they would never go,” said the countess, when she\r\n      had seen her guests out."

    "text": "When Natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the\r\n      conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in\r\n      the drawing room, waiting for Borís to come out. She was already growing\r\n      impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once,\r\n      when she heard the young man’s discreet steps approaching neither quickly\r\n      nor slowly. At this Natásha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid\r\n      there.\nBorís paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little\r\n      dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined his\r\n      handsome face. Natásha, very still, peered out from her ambush, waiting to\r\n      see what he would do. He stood a little while before the glass, smiled,\r\n      and walked toward the other door. Natásha was about to call him but\r\n      changed her mind. “Let him look for me,” thought she. Hardly had Borís\r\n      gone than Sónya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came in at the\r\n      other door. Natásha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and\r\n      remained in her hiding place, watching—as under an invisible cap—to\r\n      see what went on in the world. She was experiencing a new and peculiar\r\n      pleasure. Sónya, muttering to herself, kept looking round toward the\r\n      drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas came in.\n“Sónya, what is the matter with you? How can you?” said he, running up to\r\n      her.\n“It’s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!” sobbed Sónya.\n“Ah, I know what it is.”\n“Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!”\n“Só-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that, for\r\n      a mere fancy?” said Nicholas taking her hand.\nSónya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natásha, not stirring and\r\n      scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes. “What\r\n      will happen now?” thought she.\n“Sónya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are everything!” said\r\n      Nicholas. “And I will prove it to you.”\n“I don’t like you to talk like that.”\n“Well, then, I won’t; only forgive me, Sónya!” He drew her to him and\r\n      kissed her.\n“Oh, how nice,” thought Natásha; and when Sónya and Nicholas had gone out\r\n      of the conservatory she followed and called Borís to her.\n“Borís, come here,” said she with a sly and significant look. “I have\r\n      something to tell you. Here, here!” and she led him into the conservatory\r\n      to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.\nBorís followed her, smiling.\n“What is thesomething?” asked he.\nShe grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown down\r\n      on one of the tubs, picked it up.\n“Kiss the doll,” said she.\nBorís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply.\n“Don’t you want to? Well, then, come here,” said she, and went further in\r\n      among the plants and threw down the doll. “Closer, closer!” she whispered.\nShe caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and\r\n      fear appeared on her flushed face.\n“And me? Would you like to kiss me?” she whispered almost inaudibly,\r\n      glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from\r\n      excitement.\nBorís blushed.\n“How funny you are!” he said, bending down to her and blushing still more,\r\n      but he waited and did nothing.\nSuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so\r\n      that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing\r\n      back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.\nThen she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs\r\n      and stood, hanging her head.\n“Natásha,” he said, “you know that I love you, but....”\n“You are in love with me?” Natásha broke in.\n“Yes, I am, but please don’t let us do like that.... In another four years\r\n      ... then I will ask for your hand.”\nNatásha considered.\n“Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,” she counted on her slender little\r\n      fingers. “All right! Then it’s settled?”\nA smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.\n“Settled!” replied Borís.\n“Forever?” said the little girl. “Till death itself?”\nShe took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining\r\n      sitting room."

    "text": "After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave\r\n      orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to\r\n      dinner all who came “to congratulate.” The countess wished to have a\r\n      tête-à-tête talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from\r\n      Petersburg. Anna Mikháylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face, drew\r\n      her chair nearer to that of the countess.\n“With you I will be quite frank,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “There are not\r\n      many left of us old friends! That’s why I so value your friendship.”\nAnna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused. The countess pressed her\r\n      friend’s hand.\n“Véra,” she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite,\r\n      “how is it you have so little tact? Don’t you see you are not wanted here?\r\n      Go to the other girls, or...”\nThe handsome Véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.\n“If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,” she replied as she\r\n      rose to go to her own room.\nBut as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting, one\r\n      pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. Sónya was sitting\r\n      close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the first he\r\n      had ever written. Borís and Natásha were at the other window and ceased\r\n      talking when Véra entered. Sónya and Natásha looked at Véra with guilty,\r\n      happy faces.\nIt was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but\r\n      apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Véra.\n“How often have I asked you not to take my things?” she said. “You have a\r\n      room of your own,” and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.\n“In a minute, in a minute,” he said, dipping his pen.\n“You always manage to do things at the wrong time,” continued Véra. “You\r\n      came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you.”\nThough what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one\r\n      replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the\r\n      room with the inkstand in her hand.\n“And at your age what secrets can there be between Natásha and Borís, or\r\n      between you two? It’s all nonsense!”\n“Now, Véra, what does it matter to you?” said Natásha in defense, speaking\r\n      very gently.\nShe seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to\r\n      everyone.\n“Very silly,” said Véra. “I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!”\n“All have secrets of their own,” answered Natásha, getting warmer. “We\r\n      don’t interfere with you and Berg.”\n“I should think not,” said Véra, “because there can never be anything\r\n      wrong in my behavior. But I’ll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with\r\n      Borís.”\n“Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me,” remarked Borís. “I have\r\n      nothing to complain of.”\n“Don’t, Borís! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome,” said\r\n      Natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly. (She used the word\r\n      “diplomat,” which was just then much in vogue among the children, in the\r\n      special sense they attached to it.) “Why does she bother me?” And she\r\n      added, turning to Véra, “You’ll never understand it, because you’ve never\r\n      loved anyone. You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing\r\n      more” (this nickname, bestowed on Véra by Nicholas, was considered very\r\n      stinging), “and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go\r\n      and flirt with Berg as much as you please,” she finished quickly.\n“I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...”\n“Well, now you’ve done what you wanted,” put in Nicholas—“said\r\n      unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let’s go to the nursery.”\nAll four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.\n“The unpleasant things were said to me,” remarked Véra, “I said none to\r\n      anyone.”\n“Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!” shouted laughing voices through the\r\n      door.\nThe handsome Véra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect\r\n      on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been said to her,\r\n      went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf. Looking at her\r\n      own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer.\n\nIn the drawing room the conversation was still going on.\n“Ah, my dear,” said the countess, “my life is not all roses either. Don’t\r\n      I know that at the rate we are living our means won’t last long? It’s all\r\n      the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the country do we get any rest?\r\n      Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But don’t let’s talk\r\n      about me; tell me how you managed everything. I often wonder at you,\r\n      Annette—how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to\r\n      Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how\r\n      to deal with them all! It’s quite astonishing. How did you get things\r\n      settled? I couldn’t possibly do it.”\n“Ah, my love,” answered Anna Mikháylovna, “God grant you never know what\r\n      it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to\r\n      distraction! One learns many things then,” she added with a certain pride.\r\n      “That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those big people I\r\n      write a note: ‘Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,’\r\n      and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times—till I\r\n      get what I want. I don’t mind what they think of me.”\n“Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?” asked the countess. “You see\r\n      yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is going as a\r\n      cadet. There’s no one to interest himself for him. To whom did you apply?”\n“To Prince Vasíli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything, and\r\n      put the matter before the Emperor,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna\r\n      enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to\r\n      gain her end.\n“Has Prince Vasíli aged much?” asked the countess. “I have not seen him\r\n      since we acted together at the Rumyántsovs’ theatricals. I expect he has\r\n      forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,” said the countess,\r\n      with a smile.\n“He is just the same as ever,” replied Anna Mikháylovna, “overflowing with\r\n      amiability. His position has not turned his head at all. He said to me, ‘I\r\n      am sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.’\r\n      Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation. But, Nataly, you know\r\n      my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs\r\n      are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one,” continued\r\n      Anna Mikháylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. “My wretched lawsuit takes\r\n      all I have and makes no progress. Would you believe it, I have literally\r\n      not a penny and don’t know how to equip Borís.” She took out her\r\n      handkerchief and began to cry. “I need five hundred rubles, and have only\r\n      one twenty-five-ruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is\r\n      in Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov. If he will not assist his godson—you\r\n      know he is Bóry’s godfather—and allow him something for his\r\n      maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be\r\n      able to equip him.”\nThe countess’ eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.\n“I often think, though, perhaps it’s a sin,” said the princess, “that here\r\n      lives Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov so rich, all alone... that\r\n      tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It’s a burden to him,\r\n      and Bóry’s life is only just beginning....”\n“Surely he will leave something to Borís,” said the countess.\n“Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish. Still, I\r\n      will take Borís and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him\r\n      straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it’s really all the\r\n      same to me when my son’s fate is at stake.” The princess rose. “It’s now\r\n      two o’clock and you dine at four. There will just be time.”\nAnd like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of\r\n      time, Anna Mikháylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the\r\n      anteroom with him.\n“Good-by, my dear,” said she to the countess who saw her to the door, and\r\n      added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, “Wish me good luck.”\n“Are you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dear?” said the count\r\n      coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added: “If he is\r\n      better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the house, you know,\r\n      and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my dear. We will see\r\n      how Tarás distinguishes himself today. He says Count Orlóv never gave such\r\n      a dinner as ours will be!”"

    "text": "“My dear Borís,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna to her son as Countess\r\n      Rostóva’s carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered\r\n      street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril Vladímirovich\r\n      Bezúkhov’s house. “My dear Borís,” said the mother, drawing her hand from\r\n      beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son’s\r\n      arm, “be affectionate and attentive to him. Count Cyril Vladímirovich is\r\n      your godfather after all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my\r\n      dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how to be.”\n“If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it...”\r\n       answered her son coldly. “But I have promised and will do it for your\r\n      sake.”\nAlthough the hall porter saw someone’s carriage standing at the entrance,\r\n      after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to be announced\r\n      had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in\r\n      niches) and looking significantly at the lady’s old cloak, he asked\r\n      whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and, hearing that they\r\n      wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse today, and that his\r\n      excellency was not receiving anyone.\n“We may as well go back,” said the son in French.\n“My dear!” exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on his\r\n      arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.\nBorís said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking\r\n      off his cloak.\n“My friend,” said Anna Mikháylovna in gentle tones, addressing the hall\r\n      porter, “I know Count Cyril Vladímirovich is very ill... that’s why I have\r\n      come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my friend... I only need\r\n      see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich: he is staying here, is he not? Please\r\n      announce me.”\nThe hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned\r\n      away.\n“Princess Drubetskáya to see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich,” he called to a\r\n      footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat, who ran\r\n      downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.\nThe mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large\r\n      Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly\r\n      ascended the carpeted stairs.\n“My dear,” she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch, “you\r\n      promised me!”\nThe son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.\nThey entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the\r\n      apartments assigned to Prince Vasíli.\nJust as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were\r\n      about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they\r\n      entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasíli\r\n      came out—wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast, as\r\n      was his custom when at home—taking leave of a good-looking,\r\n      dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.\n“Then it is certain?” said the prince.\n“Prince,humanum est errare, * but...” replied the doctor,\r\n      swallowing hisr’s, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French\r\n      accent.\n* To err is human.\n“Very well, very well...”\nSeeing Anna Mikháylovna and her son, Prince Vasíli dismissed the doctor\r\n      with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry. The\r\n      son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his\r\n      mother’s face, and he smiled slightly.\n“Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear\r\n      invalid?” said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on\r\n      her.\nPrince Vasíli stared at her and at Borís questioningly and perplexed.\r\n      Borís bowed politely. Prince Vasíli without acknowledging the bow turned\r\n      to Anna Mikháylovna, answering her query by a movement of the head and\r\n      lips indicating very little hope for the patient.\n“Is it possible?” exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna. “Oh, how awful! It is\r\n      terrible to think.... This is my son,” she added, indicating Borís. “He\r\n      wanted to thank you himself.”\nBorís bowed again politely.\n“Believe me, Prince, a mother’s heart will never forget what you have done\r\n      for us.”\n“I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said\r\n      Prince Vasíli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in\r\n      Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had placed under an obligation,\r\n      assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg\r\n      at Anna Schérer’s reception.\n“Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,” added he, addressing Borís\r\n      with severity. “I am glad.... Are you here on leave?” he went on in his\r\n      usual tone of indifference.\n“I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,” replied\r\n      Borís, betraying neither annoyance at the prince’s brusque manner nor a\r\n      desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly and\r\n      respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.\n“Are you living with your mother?”\n“I am living at Countess Rostóva’s,” replied Borís, again adding, “your\r\n      excellency.”\n“That is, with Ilyá Rostóv who married Nataly Shinshiná,” said Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna.\n“I know, I know,” answered Prince Vasíli in his monotonous voice. “I never\r\n      could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear!\r\n      A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told.”\n“But a very kind man, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a pathetic\r\n      smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostóv deserved this censure, but\r\n      asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. “What do the doctors\r\n      say?” asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again expressing\r\n      deep sorrow.\n“They give little hope,” replied the prince.\n“And I should so like to thankUncleonce for all his kindness to\r\n      me and Borís. He is his godson,” she added, her tone suggesting that this\r\n      fact ought to give Prince Vasíli much satisfaction.\nPrince Vasíli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikháylovna saw that he\r\n      was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezúkhov’s fortune, and\r\n      hastened to reassure him.\n“If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion toUncle,”\r\n       said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, “I know\r\n      his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with him\r\n      except the young princesses.... They are still young....” She bent her\r\n      head and continued in a whisper: “Has he performed his final duty, Prince?\r\n      How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, and it\r\n      is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. We women, Prince,”\r\n       and she smiled tenderly, “always know how to say these things. I\r\n      absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me. I am used to\r\n      suffering.”\nEvidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done\r\n      at Anna Pávlovna’s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna.\n“Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikháylovna?”\r\n       said he. “Let us wait until evening. The doctors are expecting a crisis.”\n“But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the welfare\r\n      of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...”\nA door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the\r\n      count’s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body was\r\n      strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasíli turned to\r\n      her.\n“Well, how is he?”\n“Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...” said the\r\n      princess, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a stranger.\n“Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a happy\r\n      smile, ambling lightly up to the count’s niece. “I have come, and am at\r\n      your service to help you nursemy uncle. I imagine what you have\r\n      gone through,” and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.\nThe princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as\r\n      Anna Mikháylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had\r\n      conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasíli to take a\r\n      seat beside her.\n“Borís,” she said to her son with a smile, “I shall go in to see the\r\n      count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and\r\n      don’t forget to give him the Rostóvs’ invitation. They ask him to dinner.\r\n      I suppose he won’t go?” she continued, turning to the prince.\n“On the contrary,” replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed,\r\n      “I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man.... Here he\r\n      is, and the count has not once asked for him.”\nHe shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Borís down one flight of\r\n      stairs and up another, to Pierre’s rooms."

    "text": "Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in\r\n      Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent\r\n      to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostóv’s was true. Pierre had\r\n      taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been for some days\r\n      in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father’s house. Though he\r\n      expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow\r\n      and that the ladies about his father—who were never favorably\r\n      disposed toward him—would have used it to turn the count against\r\n      him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father’s part\r\n      of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most\r\n      of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at\r\n      embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was\r\n      reading—the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna. The two younger ones\r\n      were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in\r\n      that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre\r\n      was received as if he were a corpse or a leper. The eldest princess paused\r\n      in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second\r\n      assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with\r\n      the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her\r\n      frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw.\r\n      She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain\r\n      from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern.\n“How do you do, cousin?” said Pierre. “You don’t recognize me?”\n“I recognize you only too well, too well.”\n“How is the count? Can I see him?” asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but\r\n      unabashed.\n“The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have\r\n      done your best to increase his mental sufferings.”\n“Can I see the count?” Pierre again asked.\n“Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him...\r\n      Olga, go and see whether Uncle’s beef tea is ready—it is almost\r\n      time,” she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and\r\n      busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only\r\n      busy causing him annoyance.\nOlga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and\r\n      said: “Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see\r\n      him.”\nAnd he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the\r\n      sister with the mole.\nNext day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count’s house. He\r\n      sent for Pierre and said to him: “My dear fellow, if you are going to\r\n      behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that is all\r\n      I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must not see\r\n      him at all.”\nSince then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in\r\n      his rooms upstairs.\nWhen Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,\r\n      stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,\r\n      as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely over\r\n      his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering indistinct\r\n      words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.\n“England is done for,” said he, scowling and pointing his finger at\r\n      someone unseen. “Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of\r\n      man, is sentenced to...” But before Pierre—who at that moment\r\n      imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the\r\n      dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London—could\r\n      pronounce Pitt’s sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young officer\r\n      entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Borís was a boy\r\n      of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive and\r\n      hearty way he took Borís by the hand with a friendly smile.\n“Do you remember me?” asked Borís quietly with a pleasant smile. “I have\r\n      come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.”\n“Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,” answered\r\n      Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.\nBorís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it\r\n      necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least\r\n      embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.\n“Count Rostóv asks you to come to dinner today,” said he, after a\r\n      considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.\n“Ah, Count Rostóv!” exclaimed Pierre joyfully. “Then you are his son,\r\n      Ilyá? Only fancy, I didn’t know you at first. Do you remember how we went\r\n      to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It’s such an age...”\n“You are mistaken,” said Borís deliberately, with a bold and slightly\r\n      sarcastic smile. “I am Borís, son of Princess Anna Mikháylovna\r\n      Drubetskáya. Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is Nicholas. I never\r\n      knew any Madame Jacquot.”\nPierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.\n“Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I’ve mixed everything up. One has so\r\n      many relatives in Moscow! So you are Borís? Of course. Well, now we know\r\n      where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? The\r\n      English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the\r\n      Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve\r\n      doesn’t make a mess of things!”\nBorís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the\r\n      papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve’s name.\n“We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than\r\n      with politics,” said he in his quiet ironical tone. “I know nothing about\r\n      it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip,” he\r\n      continued. “Just now they are talking about you and your father.”\nPierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion’s\r\n      sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret. But\r\n      Borís spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into Pierre’s\r\n      eyes.\n“Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,” Borís went on. “Everybody is\r\n      wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune, though he may perhaps\r\n      outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...”\n“Yes, it is all very horrid,” interrupted Pierre, “very horrid.”\nPierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say\r\n      something disconcerting to himself.\n“And it must seem to you,” said Borís flushing slightly, but not changing\r\n      his tone or attitude, “it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get\r\n      something out of the rich man?”\n“So it does,” thought Pierre.\n“But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are quite\r\n      mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are very\r\n      poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your\r\n      father is rich, I don’t regard myself as a relation of his, and neither I\r\n      nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.”\nFor a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped up\r\n      from the sofa, seized Borís under the elbow in his quick, clumsy way, and,\r\n      blushing far more than Borís, began to speak with a feeling of mingled\r\n      shame and vexation.\n“Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know\r\n      very well...”\nBut Borís again interrupted him.\n“I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You must\r\n      excuse me,” said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease\r\n      by him, “but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it a rule to\r\n      speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at\r\n      the Rostóvs’?”\nAnd Borís, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and\r\n      extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,\r\n      became quite pleasant again.\n“No, but I say,” said Pierre, calming down, “you are a wonderful fellow!\r\n      What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you don’t know me.\r\n      We have not met for such a long time... not since we were children. You\r\n      might think that I... I understand, quite understand. I could not have\r\n      done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but it’s splendid. I am\r\n      very glad to have made your acquaintance. It’s queer,” he added after a\r\n      pause, “that you should have suspected me!” He began to laugh. “Well, what\r\n      of it! I hope we’ll get better acquainted,” and he pressed Borís’ hand.\r\n      “Do you know, I have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent\r\n      for me.... I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?”\n“And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?” asked Borís\r\n      with a smile.\nPierre saw that Borís wished to change the subject, and being of the same\r\n      mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne\r\n      expedition.\nA footman came in to summon Borís—the princess was going. Pierre, in\r\n      order to make Borís’ better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner, and\r\n      warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into\r\n      Borís’ eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the\r\n      room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his\r\n      imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant,\r\n      intelligent, and resolute young man.\nAs often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely\r\n      life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up\r\n      his mind that they would be friends.\nPrince Vasíli saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes\r\n      and her face was tearful.\n“It is dreadful, dreadful!” she was saying, “but cost me what it may I\r\n      shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be left\r\n      like this. Every moment is precious. I can’t think why his nieces put it\r\n      off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!... Adieu,\r\n      Prince! May God support you...”\n“Adieu, ma bonne,”answered Prince Vasíli turning away from her.\n“Oh, he is in a dreadful state,” said the mother to her son when they were\r\n      in the carriage. “He hardly recognizes anybody.”\n“I don’t understand, Mamma—what is his attitude to Pierre?” asked\r\n      the son.\n“The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.”\n“But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?”\n“Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!”\n“Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...”\n“Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!” exclaimed the mother."

    "text": "After Anna Mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril\r\n      Vladímirovich Bezúkhov, Countess Rostóva sat for a long time all alone\r\n      applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.\n“What is the matter with you, my dear?” she said crossly to the maid who\r\n      kept her waiting some minutes. “Don’t you wish to serve me? Then I’ll find\r\n      you another place.”\nThe countess was upset by her friend’s sorrow and humiliating poverty, and\r\n      was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found\r\n      expression in calling her maid “my dear” and speaking to her with\r\n      exaggerated politeness.\n“I am very sorry, ma’am,” answered the maid.\n“Ask the count to come to me.”\nThe count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as\r\n      usual.\n“Well, little countess? What asautéof gameau madèrewe\r\n      are to have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Tarás\r\n      were not ill-spent. He is worth it!”\nHe sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling\r\n      his gray hair.\n“What are your commands, little countess?”\n“You see, my dear... What’s that mess?” she said, pointing to his\r\n      waistcoat. “It’s thesauté, most likely,” she added with a smile.\r\n      “Well, you see, Count, I want some money.”\nHer face became sad.\n“Oh, little countess!” ... and the count began bustling to get out his\r\n      pocketbook.\n“I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,” and taking out\r\n      her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband’s waistcoat.\n“Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who’s there?” he called out in a tone\r\n      only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to\r\n      obey the summons. “Send Dmítri to me!”\nDmítri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count’s house\r\n      and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.\n“This is what I want, my dear fellow,” said the count to the deferential\r\n      young man who had entered. “Bring me...” he reflected a moment, “yes,\r\n      bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don’t bring me such tattered\r\n      and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the countess.”\n“Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please,” said the countess, sighing deeply.\n“When would you like them, your excellency?” asked Dmítri. “Allow me to\r\n      inform you... But, don’t be uneasy,” he added, noticing that the count was\r\n      beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of\r\n      approaching anger. “I was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?”\n“Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.”\n“What a treasure that Dmítri is,” added the count with a smile when the\r\n      young man had departed. “There is never any ‘impossible’ with him. That’s\r\n      a thing I hate! Everything is possible.”\n“Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,” said\r\n      the countess. “But I am in great need of this sum.”\n“You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the count,\r\n      and having kissed his wife’s hand he went back to his study.\nWhen Anna Mikháylovna returned from Count Bezúkhov’s the money, all in\r\n      clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess’ little\r\n      table, and Anna Mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating her.\n“Well, my dear?” asked the countess.\n“Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so ill!\r\n      I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...”\n“Annette, for heaven’s sake don’t refuse me,” the countess began, with a\r\n      blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and\r\n      she took the money from under the handkerchief.\nAnna Mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready\r\n      to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.\n“This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.”\nAnna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess wept\r\n      too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were\r\n      kindhearted, and because they—friends from childhood—had to\r\n      think about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was\r\n      over.... But those tears were pleasant to them both."

    "text": "Countess Rostóva, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was\r\n      already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into his\r\n      study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From time to\r\n      time he went out to ask: “Hasn’t she come yet?” They were\r\n      expecting Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, known in society asle terrible\r\n      dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common sense and\r\n      frank plainness of speech. Márya Dmítrievna was known to the Imperial family as\r\n      well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her,\r\n      laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her,\r\n      while none the less all without exception respected and feared her.\nIn the count’s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of the war\r\n      that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the recruiting. None of\r\n      them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew it had appeared. The\r\n      count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking. He\r\n      neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one side and then\r\n      to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the\r\n      conversation of his two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.\nOne of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled\r\n      face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable\r\n      young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,\r\n      having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the\r\n      smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,\r\n      Shinshín, a cousin of the countess’, a man with “a sharp tongue” as they\r\n      said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his companion.\r\n      The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed,\r\n      brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with\r\n      red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome\r\n      mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semënov\r\n      regiment with whom Borís was to travel to join the army, and about whom\r\n      Natásha had teased her elder sister Véra, speaking of Berg as her\r\n      “intended.” The count sat between them and listened attentively. His\r\n      favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond\r\n      of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two\r\n      loquacious talkers at one another.\n“Well, then, old chap,mon très honorableAlphonse Kárlovich,” said\r\n      Shinshín, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian\r\n      expressions with the choicest French phrases—which was a peculiarity\r\n      of his speech. “Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l’état; *\r\n      you want to make something out of your company?”\n* You expect to make an income out of the government.\n“No, Peter Nikoláevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry the\r\n      advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own\r\n      position now, Peter Nikoláevich...”\nBerg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His\r\n      conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm and\r\n      silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on\r\n      himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of\r\n      countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the\r\n      conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and\r\n      with evident satisfaction.\n“Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich. Were I in the cavalry I should\r\n      get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even with the rank\r\n      of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty,” said he,\r\n      looking at Shinshín and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it\r\n      were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of\r\n      everyone else.\n“Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall be\r\n      in a more prominent position,” continued Berg, “and vacancies occur much\r\n      more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what can be done with\r\n      two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little aside and to\r\n      send something to my father,” he went on, emitting a smoke ring.\n“La balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the\r\n      proverb says,” remarked Shinshín, moving his pipe to the other side of his\r\n      mouth and winking at the count.\n* So that squares matters.\nThe count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinshín was\r\n      talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,\r\n      continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already\r\n      gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime the\r\n      company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company, might\r\n      easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in the\r\n      regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently\r\n      enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others, too,\r\n      might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily sedate,\r\n      and the naïveté of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed\r\n      his hearers.\n“Well, my boy, you’ll get along wherever you go—foot or horse—that\r\n      I’ll warrant,” said Shinshín, patting him on the shoulder and taking his\r\n      feet off the sofa.\nBerg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into\r\n      the drawing room.\nIt was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,\r\n      expecting the summons tozakúska, * avoid engaging in any long\r\n      conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order to\r\n      show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and\r\n      hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another, and\r\n      the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are\r\n      waiting for—some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a\r\n      dish that is not yet ready.\n* Hors d’oeuvres.\nPierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle\r\n      of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across, blocking the\r\n      way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on\r\n      naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody\r\n      and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He was in the way and was\r\n      the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of\r\n      the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet\r\n      man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a\r\n      prank on a policeman.\n“You have only lately arrived?” the countess asked him.\n“Oui, madame,”replied he, looking around him.\n“You have not yet seen my husband?”\n“Non, madame.”He smiled quite inappropriately.\n“You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it’s very\r\n      interesting.”\n“Very interesting.”\nThe countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna. The latter\r\n      understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and\r\n      sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he\r\n      answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other\r\n      guests were all conversing with one another. “The Razumóvskis... It was\r\n      charming... You are very kind... Countess Apráksina...” was heard on all\r\n      sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.\n“Márya Dmítrievna?” came her voice from there.\n“Herself,” came the answer in a rough voice, and Márya Dmítrievna entered\r\n      the room.\nAll the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest\r\n      rose. Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout, holding high\r\n      her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the\r\n      guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up.\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna always spoke in Russian.\n“Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her\r\n      children,” she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all\r\n      others. “Well, you old sinner,” she went on, turning to the count who was\r\n      kissing her hand, “you’re feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere to\r\n      hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just see how these\r\n      nestlings are growing up,” and she pointed to the girls. “You must look\r\n      for husbands for them whether you like it or not....”\n“Well,” said she, “how’s my Cossack?” (Márya Dmítrievna always called\r\n      Natásha a Cossack) and she stroked the child’s arm as she came up fearless\r\n      and gay to kiss her hand. “I know she’s a scamp of a girl, but I like\r\n      her.”\nShe took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,\r\n      having given them to the rosy Natásha, who beamed with the pleasure of her\r\n      saint’s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre.\n“Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,” said she, assuming a soft high tone of\r\n      voice. “Come here, my friend...” and she ominously tucked up her sleeves\r\n      still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike way through\r\n      his spectacles.\n“Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell your\r\n      father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it’s my evident\r\n      duty.” She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to follow, for\r\n      this was clearly only a prelude.\n“A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed and\r\n      he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame, sir, for\r\n      shame! It would be better if you went to the war.”\nShe turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep from\r\n      laughing.\n“Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?” said Márya Dmítrievna.\nThe count went in first with Márya Dmítrievna, the countess followed on\r\n      the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because\r\n      Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikháylovna\r\n      with Shinshín. Berg gave his arm to Véra. The smiling Julie Karágina went\r\n      in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the whole\r\n      dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses\r\n      followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band\r\n      struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their places.\r\n      Then the strains of the count’s household band were replaced by the\r\n      clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the soft steps of\r\n      the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna on her right and Anna Mikháylovna on her left, the other lady\r\n      visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count, with the\r\n      hussar colonel on his left and Shinshín and the other male visitors on his\r\n      right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the grown-up young\r\n      people: Véra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Borís; and on the other side,\r\n      the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters\r\n      and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with\r\n      its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors’ glasses, not\r\n      neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as\r\n      hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her\r\n      husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more\r\n      than usual with his gray hair. At the ladies’ end an even chatter of\r\n      voices was heard all the time, at the men’s end the voices sounded louder\r\n      and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more\r\n      and more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a\r\n      pattern to the other guests. Berg with tender smiles was saying to Véra\r\n      that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling. Borís was telling his\r\n      new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natásha,\r\n      who was sitting opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces,\r\n      and ate a great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties\r\n      and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the\r\n      wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a\r\n      napkin, from behind the next man’s shoulders and whispered: “Dry\r\n      Madeira”... “Hungarian”... or “Rhine wine” as the case might be. Of the\r\n      four crystal glasses engraved with the count’s monogram that stood before\r\n      his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing\r\n      with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests. Natásha, who sat\r\n      opposite, was looking at Borís as girls of thirteen look at the boy they\r\n      are in love with and have just kissed for the first time. Sometimes that\r\n      same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl’s look made\r\n      him inclined to laugh without knowing why.\nNicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina, to whom\r\n      he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sónya wore a company\r\n      smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned pale, now\r\n      blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were\r\n      saying to one another. The governess kept looking round uneasily as if\r\n      preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children. The\r\n      German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of\r\n      dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people\r\n      in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle\r\n      wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as if he\r\n      did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would\r\n      understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he\r\n      wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge."

    "text": "At the men’s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The\r\n      colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in\r\n      Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been\r\n      forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.\n“And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?” remarked Shinshín.\r\n      “He has stopped Austria’s cackle and I fear it will be our turn next.”\nThe colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to the\r\n      service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshín’s remark.\n“It is for the reasson, my goot sir,” said he, speaking with a German\r\n      accent, “for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He declares in ze\r\n      manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia\r\n      and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity of itsalliances...” he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as\r\n      if in it lay the gist of the matter.\nThen with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated\r\n      from the opening words of the manifesto:\n...and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor’s sole and absolute aim—to\r\n      establish peace in Europe on firm foundations—has now decided him to\r\n      despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the\r\n      attainment of that purpose.\n“Zat, my dear sir, is vy...” he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine with\r\n      dignity and looking to the count for approval.\n“Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* ‘Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but\r\n      turn spindles at home!’?” said Shinshín, puckering his brows and smiling.\r\n      “Cela nous convient à merveille.*(2) Suvórov now—he knew what\r\n      he was about; yet they beat himà plate couture,*(3) and where are\r\n      we to find Suvórovs now?Je vous demande un peu,” *(4) said he,\r\n      continually changing from French to Russian.\n* Do you know the proverb?\n*(2) That suits us down to the ground.\n*(3) Hollow.\n*(4) I just ask you that.\n“Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!” said the colonel,\r\n      thumping the table; “and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill pe\r\n      vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible”... he dwelt\r\n      particularly on the wordpossible... “as po-o-ossible,” he ended,\r\n      again turning to the count. “Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and\r\n      zere’s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how\r\n      do you judge of it?” he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that\r\n      the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears\r\n      intent on the colonel.\n“I am quite of your opinion,” replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his\r\n      plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and\r\n      desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger. “I\r\n      am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,” he concluded,\r\n      conscious—as were others—after the words were uttered that his\r\n      remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were\r\n      therefore awkward.\n“What you said just now was splendid!” said his partner Julie.\nSónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down\r\n      to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.\nPierre listened to the colonel’s speech and nodded approvingly.\n“That’s fine,” said he.\n“The young man’s a real hussar!” shouted the colonel, again thumping the\r\n      table.\n“What are you making such a noise about over there?” Márya Dmítrievna’s\r\n      deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table. “What are\r\n      you thumping the table for?” she demanded of the hussar, “and why are you\r\n      exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?”\n“I am speaking ze truce,” replied the hussar with a smile.\n“It’s all about the war,” the count shouted down the table. “You know my\r\n      son’s going, Márya Dmítrievna? My son is going.”\n“I have four sons in the army but still I don’t fret. It is all in God’s\r\n      hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,” replied\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna’s deep voice, which easily carried the whole length of\r\n      the table.\n“That’s true!”\nOnce more the conversations concentrated, the ladies’ at the one end and\r\n      the men’s at the other.\n“You won’t ask,” Natásha’s little brother was saying; “I know you won’t\r\n      ask!”\n“I will,” replied Natásha.\nHer face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half\r\n      rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was\r\n      coming, and turning to her mother:\n“Mamma!” rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice, audible\r\n      the whole length of the table.\n“What is it?” asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughter’s\r\n      face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a\r\n      threatening and forbidding movement of her head.\nThe conversation was hushed.\n“Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” and Natásha’s voice sounded\r\n      still more firm and resolute.\nThe countess tried to frown, but could not. Márya Dmítrievna shook her fat\r\n      finger.\n“Cossack!” she said threateningly.\nMost of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the\r\n      elders.\n“You had better take care!” said the countess.\n“Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” Natásha again cried boldly,\r\n      with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in good part.\nSónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter.\n“You see! Ihaveasked,” whispered Natásha to her little brother\r\n      and to Pierre, glancing at him again.\n“Ice pudding, but you won’t get any,” said Márya Dmítrievna.\nNatásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna.\n“Márya Dmítrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don’t like ice cream.”\n“Carrot ices.”\n“No! What kind, Márya Dmítrievna? What kind?” she almost screamed; “I want\r\n      to know!”\nMárya Dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests\r\n      joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Márya Dmítrievna’s answer but at the\r\n      incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to\r\n      treat Márya Dmítrievna in this fashion.\nNatásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple\r\n      ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band again struck\r\n      up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats,\r\n      went up to “congratulate” the countess, and reached across the table to\r\n      clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one another.\r\n      Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in\r\n      which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned to the\r\n      drawing room and to the count’s study."

    "text": "The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the count’s\r\n      visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms, some in the\r\n      sitting room, some in the library.\nThe count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from\r\n      dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything. The\r\n      young people, at the countess’ instigation, gathered round the clavichord\r\n      and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she had played a\r\n      little air with variations on the harp, she joined the other young ladies\r\n      in begging Natásha and Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent,\r\n      to sing something. Natásha, who was treated as though she were grown up,\r\n      was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.\n“What shall we sing?” she said.\n“‘The Brook,’” suggested Nicholas.\n“Well, then, let’s be quick. Borís, come here,” said Natásha. “But where\r\n      is Sónya?”\nShe looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to\r\n      look for her.\nRunning into Sónya’s room and not finding her there, Natásha ran to the\r\n      nursery, but Sónya was not there either. Natásha concluded that she must\r\n      be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was the place of\r\n      mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostóv household. And\r\n      there in fact was Sónya lying face downward on Nurse’s dirty feather bed\r\n      on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding\r\n      her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively that her\r\n      bare little shoulders shook. Natásha’s face, which had been so radiantly\r\n      happy all that saint’s day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and\r\n      then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth\r\n      drooped.\n“Sónya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!” And\r\n      Natásha’s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began\r\n      to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sónya was crying.\r\n      Sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and hid her face\r\n      still deeper in the bed. Natásha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather\r\n      bed and hugging her friend. With an effort Sónya sat up and began wiping\r\n      her eyes and explaining.\n“Nicholas is going away in a week’s time, his... papers... have come... he\r\n      told me himself... but still I should not cry,” and she showed a paper she\r\n      held in her hand—with the verses Nicholas had written, “still, I\r\n      should not cry, but you can’t... no one can understand... what a soul he\r\n      has!”\nAnd she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.\n“It’s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and Borís\r\n      also,” she went on, gaining a little strength; “he is nice... there are no\r\n      difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin... one would have\r\n      to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it can’t be done. And\r\n      besides, if she tells Mamma” (Sónya looked upon the countess as her mother\r\n      and called her so) “that I am spoiling Nicholas’ career and am heartless\r\n      and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness,” and she made the sign\r\n      of the cross, “I love her so much, and all of you, only Véra... And what\r\n      for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would\r\n      willingly sacrifice everything, only I have nothing....”\nSónya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the\r\n      feather bed. Natásha began consoling her, but her face showed that she\r\n      understood all the gravity of her friend’s trouble.\n“Sónya,” she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason of\r\n      her friend’s sorrow, “I’m sure Véra has said something to you since\r\n      dinner? Hasn’t she?”\n“Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and\r\n      she found them on my table and said she’d show them to Mamma, and that I\r\n      was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me, but that\r\n      he’ll marry Julie. You see how he’s been with her all day... Natásha, what\r\n      have I done to deserve it?...”\nAnd again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natásha lifted her\r\n      up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting her.\n“Sónya, don’t believe her, darling! Don’t believe her! Do you remember how\r\n      we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after supper?\r\n      Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don’t quite remember how, but\r\n      don’t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was?\r\n      There’s Uncle Shinshín’s brother has married his first cousin. And we are\r\n      only second cousins, you know. And Borís says it is quite possible. You\r\n      know I have told him all about it. And he is so clever and so good!” said\r\n      Natásha. “Don’t you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!” and she kissed\r\n      her and laughed. “Véra’s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right\r\n      and she won’t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and\r\n      he doesn’t care at all for Julie.”\nNatásha kissed her on the hair.\nSónya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed\r\n      ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin playing with\r\n      the ball of worsted as a kitten should.\n“Do you think so?... Really? Truly?” she said, quickly smoothing her frock\r\n      and hair.\n“Really, truly!” answered Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had\r\n      strayed from under her friend’s plaits.\nBoth laughed.\n“Well, let’s go and sing ‘The Brook.’”\n“Come along!”\n“Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!” said\r\n      Natásha, stopping suddenly. “I feel so happy!”\nAnd she set off at a run along the passage.\nSónya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the\r\n      verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after\r\n      Natásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and\r\n      light, joyous steps. At the visitors’ request the young people sang the\r\n      quartette, “The Brook,” with which everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas\r\n      sang a song he had just learned:\nAt nighttime in the moon’s fair glowHow sweet, as fancies wander free,To feel that in this world there’s oneWho still is thinking but of thee!That while her fingers touch the harpWafting sweet music o’er the lea,It is for thee thus swells her heart,Sighing its message out to thee...A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,But oh! till then I cannot live!...\nHe had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get\r\n      ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the\r\n      coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.\n\nPierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshín had engaged him, as\r\n      a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which\r\n      several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began Natásha\r\n      came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and blushing:\n“Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.”\n“I am afraid of mixing the figures,” Pierre replied; “but if you will be\r\n      my teacher...” And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender\r\n      little girl.\nWhile the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,\r\n      Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natásha was perfectly happy; she\r\n      was dancing with agrown-upman, who had beenabroad. She\r\n      was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up\r\n      lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to\r\n      hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and\r\n      where she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and\r\n      smiling over the fan.\n“Dear, dear! Just look at her!” exclaimed the countess as she crossed the\r\n      ballroom, pointing to Natásha.\nNatásha blushed and laughed.\n“Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?”\n\nIn the midst of the thirdécossaisethere was a clatter of chairs\r\n      being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Márya Dmítrievna\r\n      had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and\r\n      older visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long, and\r\n      replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First came\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The count,\r\n      with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up\r\n      his face and as soon as the last figure of theécossaisewas ended,\r\n      he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery,\r\n      addressing the first violin:\n“Semën! Do you know theDaniel Cooper?”\nThis was the count’s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.\r\n      (Strictly speaking,Daniel Cooperwas one figure of theanglaise.)\n“Look at Papa!” shouted Natásha to the whole company, and quite forgetting\r\n      that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her curly head to\r\n      her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.\nAnd indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the\r\n      jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders,\r\n      turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that\r\n      broadened his round face more and more, prepared the onlookers for what\r\n      was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay strains ofDaniel\r\n      Cooper(somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to\r\n      sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the\r\n      domestic serfs—the men on one side and the women on the other—who\r\n      with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry.\n“Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!” loudly remarked the\r\n      nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.\nThe count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not\r\n      want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms\r\n      hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her\r\n      stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed by\r\n      the whole of the count’s plump figure, in Márya Dmítrievna found\r\n      expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose. But\r\n      if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the\r\n      spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility\r\n      with which he capered about on his light feet, Márya Dmítrievna produced\r\n      no less impression by slight exertions—the least effort to move her\r\n      shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot—which\r\n      everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity. The dance\r\n      grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could not attract a moment’s\r\n      attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were\r\n      watching the count and Márya Dmítrievna. Natásha kept pulling everyone by\r\n      sleeve or dress, urging them to “look at Papa!” though as it was they\r\n      never took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the dance the\r\n      count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the musicians to play\r\n      faster. Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more\r\n      lightly whirled the count, flying round Márya Dmítrievna, now on his toes,\r\n      now on his heels; until, turning his partner round to her seat, he\r\n      executed the finalpas, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his\r\n      perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a\r\n      thunder of applause and laughter led by Natásha. Both partners stood\r\n      still, breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric\r\n      handkerchiefs.\n“That’s how we used to dance in our time,ma chère,” said the\r\n      count.\n“ThatwasaDaniel Cooper!” exclaimed Márya Dmítrievna,\r\n      tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily."

    "text": "While in the Rostóvs’ ballroom the sixthanglaisewas being danced,\r\n      to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen\r\n      and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezúkhov had a sixth stroke. The\r\n      doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute confession, communion\r\n      was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the sacrament of\r\n      unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense\r\n      usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of\r\n      undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation\r\n      of an important order for an expensive funeral. The Military Governor of\r\n      Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after\r\n      the count’s health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to\r\n      the celebrated grandee of Catherine’s court, Count Bezúkhov.\nThe magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up respectfully\r\n      when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an hour alone with\r\n      the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to\r\n      escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the\r\n      doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince Vasíli, who had grown\r\n      thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door,\r\n      repeating something to him several times in low tones.\nWhen the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasíli sat down all alone on a\r\n      chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other, leaning his\r\n      elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After sitting so\r\n      for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes, went\r\n      with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of\r\n      the house, to the room of the eldest princess.\nThose who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers,\r\n      and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man’s room, grew\r\n      silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door,\r\n      which creaked slightly when opened.\n“The limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be o’erpassed,” said\r\n      an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening\r\n      naïvely to his words.\n“I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?” asked the lady,\r\n      adding the priest’s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own on\r\n      the subject.\n“Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament,” replied the priest, passing his hand\r\n      over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head.\n“Who was that? The Military Governor himself?” was being asked at the\r\n      other side of the room. “How young-looking he is!”\n“Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone.\r\n      They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.”\n“I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.”\nThe second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from\r\n      weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful\r\n      pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table.\n“Beautiful,” said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather. “The\r\n      weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow one feels as if one\r\n      were in the country.”\n“Yes, indeed,” replied the princess with a sigh. “So he may have something\r\n      to drink?”\nLorrain considered.\n“Has he taken his medicine?”\n“Yes.”\nThe doctor glanced at his watch.\n“Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,” and he\r\n      indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.\n“Dere has neffer been a gase,” a German doctor was saying to an\r\n      aide-de-camp, “dat one liffs after de sird stroke.”\n“And what a well-preserved man he was!” remarked the aide-de-camp. “And\r\n      who will inherit his wealth?” he added in a whisper.\n“It von’t go begging,” replied the German with a smile.\nEveryone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second\r\n      princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain’s\r\n      instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.\n“Do you think he can last till morning?” asked the German, addressing\r\n      Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.\nLorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before his\r\n      nose.\n“Tonight, not later,” said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a\r\n      decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand\r\n      and state the patient’s condition.\nMeanwhile Prince Vasíli had opened the door into the princess’ room.\nIn this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before\r\n      the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.\r\n      The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards,\r\n      and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was just visible\r\n      behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.\n“Ah, is it you, cousin?”\nShe rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth\r\n      that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with\r\n      varnish.\n“Has anything happened?” she asked. “I am so terrified.”\n“No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,\r\n      Catiche,” * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair she\r\n      had just vacated. “You have made the place warm, I must say,” he remarked.\r\n      “Well, sit down: let’s have a talk.”\n* Catherine.\n“I thought perhaps something had happened,” she said with her unchanging\r\n      stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the prince, she\r\n      prepared to listen.\n“I wished to get a nap,mon cousin, but I can’t.”\n“Well, my dear?” said Prince Vasíli, taking her hand and bending it\r\n      downwards as was his habit.\nIt was plain that this “well?” referred to much that they both understood\r\n      without naming.\nThe princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her\r\n      legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her\r\n      prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons\r\n      with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and\r\n      devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince Vasíli\r\n      understood it as an expression of weariness.\n“And I?” he said; “do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out as a\r\n      post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very serious\r\n      talk.”\nPrince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now\r\n      on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression\r\n      which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes too seemed\r\n      strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced\r\n      round in alarm.\nThe princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands,\r\n      looked attentively into Prince Vasíli’s eyes evidently resolved not to be\r\n      the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.\n“Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semënovna,”\r\n       continued Prince Vasíli, returning to his theme, apparently not without an\r\n      inner struggle; “at such a moment as this one must think of everything.\r\n      One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you all, like\r\n      children of my own, as you know.”\nThe princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same\r\n      dull expression.\n“And then of course my family has also to be considered,” Prince Vasíli\r\n      went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her. “You\r\n      know, Catiche, that we—you three sisters, Mámontov, and my wife—are\r\n      the count’s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is for you to\r\n      talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am\r\n      getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything. Do you know I have\r\n      sent for Pierre? The count,” pointing to his portrait, “definitely\r\n      demanded that he should be called.”\nPrince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out\r\n      whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was\r\n      simply looking at him.\n“There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant,mon cousin,”\r\n       she replied, “and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow\r\n      his noble soul peacefully to leave this...”\n“Yes, yes, of course,” interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently, rubbing his\r\n      bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had\r\n      pushed away. “But... in short, the fact is... you know yourself that last\r\n      winter the count made a will by which he left all his property, not to us\r\n      his direct heirs, but to Pierre.”\n“He has made wills enough!” quietly remarked the princess. “But he cannot\r\n      leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.”\n“But, my dear,” said Prince Vasíli suddenly, clutching the little table\r\n      and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: “what if a letter has\r\n      been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre’s\r\n      legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the count’s\r\n      services, his request would be granted?...”\nThe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the\r\n      subject under discussion than those they are talking with.\n“I can tell you more,” continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand, “that\r\n      letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it.\r\n      The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon\r\n      asall is over,” and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what he meant\r\n      by the wordsall is over, “and the count’s papers are opened, the\r\n      will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition will\r\n      certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son.”\n“And our share?” asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything\r\n      might happen, only not that.\n“But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the\r\n      legal heir to everything and you won’t get anything. You must know, my\r\n      dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have been\r\n      destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you ought to\r\n      know where they are, and must find them, because...”\n“What next?” the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not\r\n      changing the expression of her eyes. “I am a woman, and you think we are\r\n      all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...un\r\n      bâtard!”* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word\r\n      would effectively prove to Prince Vasíli the invalidity of his contention.\n* A bastard.\n“Well, really, Catiche! Can’t you understand! You are so intelligent, how\r\n      is it you don’t see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor\r\n      begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will\r\n      not be Pierre but will become Count Bezúkhov, and will then inherit\r\n      everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not destroyed,\r\n      then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutifulet\r\n      tout ce qui s’ensuit!* That’s certain.”\n* And all that follows therefrom.\n“I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you,mon\r\n      cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,” said the princess with\r\n      the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something\r\n      witty and stinging.\n“My dear Princess Catherine Semënovna,” began Prince Vasíli impatiently,\r\n      “I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests as\r\n      with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I tell you for the\r\n      tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre’s\r\n      favor are among the count’s papers, then, my dear girl, you and your\r\n      sisters are not heiresses! If you don’t believe me, then believe an\r\n      expert. I have just been talking to Dmítri Onúfrich” (the family\r\n      solicitor) “and he says the same.”\nAt this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess’ ideas; her\r\n      thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice when\r\n      she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself\r\n      evidently did not expect.\n“That would be a fine thing!” said she. “I never wanted anything and I\r\n      don’t now.”\nShe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.\n“And this is gratitude—this is recognition for those who have\r\n      sacrificed everything for his sake!” she cried. “It’s splendid! Fine! I\r\n      don’t want anything, Prince.”\n“Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...” replied\r\n      Prince Vasíli.\nBut the princess did not listen to him.\n“Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect\r\n      nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude—the\r\n      blackest ingratitude—in this house...”\n“Do you or do you not know where that will is?” insisted Prince Vasíli,\r\n      his cheeks twitching more than ever.\n“Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and sacrificed\r\n      myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has been\r\n      intriguing!”\nThe princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She had\r\n      the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race. She\r\n      gave her companion an angry glance.\n“There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was all\r\n      done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards\r\n      forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last\r\n      moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let him die\r\n      feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...”\n“Who sacrificed everything for him,” chimed in the princess, who would\r\n      again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, “though he never\r\n      could appreciate it. No,mon cousin,” she added with a sigh, “I\r\n      shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward, that\r\n      in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one has to\r\n      be cunning and cruel.”\n“Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.”\n“No, I have a wicked heart.”\n“I know your heart,” repeated the prince. “I value your friendship and\r\n      wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don’t upset yourself, and let\r\n      us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an\r\n      hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where it is.\r\n      You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the count. He has,\r\n      no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it. You understand that my\r\n      sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes; that is my only\r\n      reason for being here. I came simply to help him and you.”\n“Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing—I know!” cried the\r\n      princess.\n“That’s not the point, my dear.”\n“It’s that protégé of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskáya, that Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the infamous, vile\r\n      woman!”\n“Do not let us lose any time...”\n“Ah, don’t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told\r\n      the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about Sophie—I\r\n      can’t repeat them—that it made the count quite ill and he would not\r\n      see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this vile,\r\n      infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.”\n“We’ve got to it at last—why did you not tell me about it sooner?”\n“It’s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,” said the\r\n      princess, ignoring his question. “Now I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a\r\n      great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!” almost shrieked the princess,\r\n      now quite changed. “And what does she come worming herself in here for?\r\n      But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time will come!”"

    "text": "While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the\r\n      princess’ room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and\r\n      Anna Mikháylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was driving\r\n      into the court of Count Bezúkhov’s house. As the wheels rolled softly over\r\n      the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikháylovna, having turned with words\r\n      of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and\r\n      woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikháylovna out of the\r\n      carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his dying\r\n      father which awaited him. He noticed that they had not come to the front\r\n      entrance but to the back door. While he was getting down from the carriage\r\n      steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the\r\n      entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre\r\n      noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the\r\n      house on both sides. But neither Anna Mikháylovna nor the footman nor the\r\n      coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them.\r\n      “It seems to be all right,” Pierre concluded, and followed Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase,\r\n      calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not\r\n      see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why\r\n      he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikháylovna’s air of\r\n      assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely\r\n      necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men\r\n      who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering.\r\n      These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna\r\n      pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.\n“Is this the way to the princesses’ apartments?” asked Anna Mikháylovna of\r\n      one of them.\n“Yes,” replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were now\r\n      permissible; “the door to the left, ma’am.”\n“Perhaps the count did not ask for me,” said Pierre when he reached the\r\n      landing. “I’d better go to my own room.”\nAnna Mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up.\n“Ah, my friend!” she said, touching his arm as she had done her son’s when\r\n      speaking to him that afternoon, “believe me I suffer no less than you do,\r\n      but be a man!”\n“But really, hadn’t I better go away?” he asked, looking kindly at her\r\n      over his spectacles.\n“Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you. Think\r\n      that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.” She sighed. “I\r\n      have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I\r\n      shall not forget your interests.”\nPierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had to\r\n      be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikháylovna who was already\r\n      opening a door.\nThis door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the\r\n      princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been in\r\n      this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these\r\n      rooms. Anna Mikháylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a\r\n      decanter on a tray as “my dear” and “my sweet,” asked about the princess’\r\n      health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the\r\n      left led into the princesses’ apartments. The maid with the decanter in\r\n      her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house was done in\r\n      haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna in passing\r\n      instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vasíli and the eldest\r\n      princess were sitting close together talking. Seeing them pass, Prince\r\n      Vasíli drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and\r\n      with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might.\nThis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on\r\n      Prince Vasíli’s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre\r\n      stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as if\r\n      to say that this was no more than she had expected.\n“Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,” said she in reply\r\n      to his look, and went still faster along the passage.\nPierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what\r\n      “watching over his interests” meant, but he decided that all these things\r\n      had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room\r\n      adjoining the count’s reception room. It was one of those sumptuous but\r\n      cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in\r\n      this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the\r\n      carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who\r\n      passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went into the reception\r\n      room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the\r\n      conservatory, with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine\r\n      the Great. The same people were still sitting here in almost the same\r\n      positions as before, whispering to one another. All became silent and\r\n      turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna Mikháylovna as she entered, and\r\n      at the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed\r\n      her.\nAnna Mikháylovna’s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment\r\n      had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping\r\n      Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than that\r\n      afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man\r\n      wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid glance at\r\n      all those in the room and noticing the count’s confessor there, she glided\r\n      up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow\r\n      suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and\r\n      then of another priest.\n“God be thanked that you are in time,” said she to one of the priests;\r\n      “all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man is the count’s\r\n      son,” she added more softly. “What a terrible moment!”\nHaving said this she went up to the doctor.\n“Dear doctor,” said she, “this young man is the count’s son. Is there any\r\n      hope?”\nThe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his\r\n      shoulders. Anna Mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her\r\n      shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from\r\n      the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly\r\n      sad voice, she said:\n“Trust in His mercy!” and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and\r\n      wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching\r\n      and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.\nPierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved\r\n      toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikháylovna had\r\n      disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with\r\n      something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they whispered\r\n      to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and\r\n      even servility. A deference such as he had never before received was shown\r\n      him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and\r\n      offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove\r\n      Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed\r\n      by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre wished to take another\r\n      seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself\r\n      and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at\r\n      once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person\r\n      obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him,\r\n      and that he was therefore bound to accept their services. He took the\r\n      glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady’s chair,\r\n      placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of\r\n      an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should\r\n      be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must\r\n      not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to\r\n      the will of those who were guiding him.\nNot two minutes had passed before Prince Vasíli with head erect\r\n      majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three\r\n      stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning;\r\n      his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed\r\n      Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do),\r\n      and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly\r\n      fixed on.\n“Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is well!” and\r\n      he turned to go.\nBut Pierre thought it necessary to ask: “How is...” and hesitated, not\r\n      knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man “the count,” yet\r\n      ashamed to call him “father.”\n“He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my friend...”\nPierre’s mind was in such a confused state that the word “stroke”\r\n       suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasíli in\r\n      perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness.\r\n      Prince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the\r\n      door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked\r\n      at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and\r\n      deacons and some servants also went in at the door. Through that door was\r\n      heard a noise of things being moved about, and at last Anna Mikháylovna,\r\n      still with the same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of\r\n      duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said:\n“The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be administered.\r\n      Come.”\nPierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that\r\n      the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all followed\r\n      him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that\r\n      room."

    "text": "Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its walls\r\n      hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the columns,\r\n      with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other\r\n      an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with red light\r\n      like a Russian church during evening service. Under the gleaming icons\r\n      stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth\r\n      pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw—covered to the waist\r\n      by a bright green quilt—the familiar, majestic figure of his father,\r\n      Count Bezúkhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which\r\n      reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of\r\n      his handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his large thick\r\n      hands outside the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm\r\n      downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and\r\n      an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position.\r\n      By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over their\r\n      magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their hands,\r\n      slowly and solemnly conducting the service. A little behind them stood the\r\n      two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in\r\n      front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined\r\n      look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that she\r\n      could not answer for herself should she glance round. Anna Mikháylovna,\r\n      with a meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by\r\n      the door near the strange lady. Prince Vasíli in front of the door, near\r\n      the invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm\r\n      on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose,\r\n      and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each\r\n      time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and\r\n      resignation to the will of God. “If you do not understand these\r\n      sentiments,” he seemed to be saying, “so much the worse for you!”\nBehind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants; the\r\n      men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing\r\n      themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting of\r\n      deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet\r\n      were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikháylovna, with an air of\r\n      importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about,\r\n      went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper. He\r\n      lit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began crossing\r\n      himself with the hand that held the taper.\nSophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,\r\n      watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained\r\n      with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again\r\n      began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing,\r\n      but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of temptation she\r\n      slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst of the service the\r\n      voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and\r\n      the old servant who was holding the count’s hand got up and said something\r\n      to the ladies. Anna Mikháylovna stepped forward and, stooping over the\r\n      dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back. The French doctor\r\n      held no taper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful\r\n      attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of\r\n      faith, understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and\r\n      even approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless\r\n      step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised\r\n      from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the\r\n      pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given something to drink,\r\n      there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the\r\n      service continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasíli\r\n      left the chair on which he had been leaning, and—with an air which\r\n      intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand\r\n      him it was so much the worse for them—did not go up to the dying\r\n      man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to\r\n      the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken\r\n      hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vasíli and the princess passed\r\n      out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other\r\n      before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this\r\n      occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once\r\n      for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way\r\n      essential.\nThe chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard\r\n      respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the\r\n      sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around\r\n      him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which\r\n      Anna Mikháylovna’s was the most distinct.\nPierre heard her say:\n“Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be impossible...”\nThe sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that\r\n      Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane—which,\r\n      though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of for a single\r\n      moment during the whole service. He judged by the cautious movements of\r\n      those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying\r\n      man and were moving him.\n“Catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!” he heard one of the servants\r\n      say in a frightened whisper. “Catch hold from underneath. Here!” exclaimed\r\n      different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling\r\n      of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were carrying were\r\n      too much for them.\nAs the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikháylovna, passed the young man he\r\n      caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying\r\n      man’s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those\r\n      who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly, leonine\r\n      head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its\r\n      handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not\r\n      disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre remembered\r\n      it three months before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg. But now\r\n      this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers,\r\n      and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing.\nAfter a few minutes’ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had\r\n      carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikháylovna touched Pierre’s hand and\r\n      said, “Come.” Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had\r\n      been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed.\r\n      He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His hands were\r\n      symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward. When\r\n      Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the\r\n      significance of which could not be understood by mortal man. Either this\r\n      look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look\r\n      somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do,\r\n      and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikháylovna made a hurried sign\r\n      with her eyes, glancing at the sick man’s hand and moving her lips as if\r\n      to send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to\r\n      touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large\r\n      boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count’s\r\n      face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to\r\n      see what he was to do next. Anna Mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a\r\n      chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes\r\n      asking if he were doing right. Anna Mikháylovna nodded approvingly. Again\r\n      Pierre fell into the naïvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue,\r\n      evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room\r\n      and doing his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count,\r\n      who still gazed at the spot where Pierre’s face had been before he sat\r\n      down. Anna Mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the\r\n      pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father\r\n      and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour.\r\n      Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count’s face began to twitch.\r\n      The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only\r\n      now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and from that\r\n      distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikháylovna\r\n      looked attentively at the sick man’s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted;\r\n      she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasíli\r\n      in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of\r\n      the sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant\r\n      who stood constantly at the head of the bed.\n“Wants to turn on the other side,” whispered the servant, and got up to\r\n      turn the count’s heavy body toward the wall.\nPierre rose to help him.\nWhile the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back\r\n      helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he\r\n      noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm,\r\n      or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any rate\r\n      he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre’s terror-stricken face, and\r\n      again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite\r\n      out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own\r\n      helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering\r\n      in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The\r\n      sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall. He sighed.\n“He is dozing,” said Anna Mikháylovna, observing that one of the\r\n      princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. “Let us go.”\nPierre went out."

    "text": "There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli and the\r\n      eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the\r\n      Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion\r\n      they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something\r\n      as she whispered:\n“I can’t bear the sight of that woman.”\n“Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,” said Prince Vasíli\r\n      to Anna Mikháylovna. “Go and take something, my poor Anna Mikháylovna, or\r\n      you will not hold out.”\nTo Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze\r\n      below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small\r\n      drawing room.\n“There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this\r\n      delicious Russian tea,” Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained\r\n      animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup\r\n      before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small\r\n      circular room. Around the table all who were at Count Bezúkhov’s house\r\n      that night had gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre well remembered this\r\n      small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables. During\r\n      balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked\r\n      sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in\r\n      their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders,\r\n      looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated\r\n      their reflections several times. Now this same room was dimly lighted by\r\n      two candles. On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in\r\n      disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat\r\n      there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by every\r\n      word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and\r\n      what was about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything\r\n      though he would very much have liked to. He looked inquiringly at his\r\n      monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room\r\n      where they had left Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess. Pierre\r\n      concluded that this also was essential, and after a short interval\r\n      followed her. Anna Mikháylovna was standing beside the princess, and they\r\n      were both speaking in excited whispers.\n“Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not\r\n      necessary,” said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the same\r\n      state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.\n“But, my dear princess,” answered Anna Mikháylovna blandly but\r\n      impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other\r\n      from passing, “won’t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he\r\n      needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already\r\n      prepared...”\nPrince Vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with\r\n      one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so flabby\r\n      that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but he wore the\r\n      air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying.\n“Come, my dear Anna Mikháylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You know\r\n      how fond the count is of her.”\n“I don’t even know what is in this paper,” said the younger of the two\r\n      ladies, addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she\r\n      held in her hand. “All I know is that his real will is in his writing\r\n      table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....”\nShe tried to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar her\r\n      path.\n“I know, my dear, kind princess,” said Anna Mikháylovna, seizing the\r\n      portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily. “Dear\r\n      princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him!Je vous en\r\n      conjure...”\nThe princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the\r\n      portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the\r\n      princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikháylovna.\r\n      Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none of its honeyed\r\n      firmness and softness.\n“Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a\r\n      family consultation; is it not so, Prince?”\n“Why don’t you speak, cousin?” suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that\r\n      those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. “Why do you remain\r\n      silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making a scene\r\n      on the very threshold of a dying man’s room? Intriguer!” she hissed\r\n      viciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.\nBut Anna Mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the\r\n      portfolio, and changed her grip.\nPrince Vasíli rose. “Oh!” said he with reproach and surprise, “this is\r\n      absurd! Come, let go I tell you.”\nThe princess let go.\n“And you too!”\nBut Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him.\n“Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go and\r\n      ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?”\n“But, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna, “after such a solemn sacrament,\r\n      allow him a moment’s peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion,” said\r\n      she, turning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing\r\n      with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all\r\n      dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasíli.\n“Remember that you will answer for the consequences,” said Prince Vasíli\r\n      severely. “You don’t know what you are doing.”\n“Vile woman!” shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.\nPrince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands.\nAt this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and\r\n      which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against\r\n      the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her\r\n      hands.\n“What are you doing!” she cried vehemently. “He is dying and you leave me\r\n      alone with him!”\nHer sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikháylovna, stooping, quickly\r\n      caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest\r\n      princess and Prince Vasíli, recovering themselves, followed her. A few\r\n      minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again\r\n      biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an\r\n      irrepressible hatred.\n“Yes, now you may be glad!” said she; “this is what you have been waiting\r\n      for.” And bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and\r\n      rushed from the room.\nPrince Vasíli came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was\r\n      sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre\r\n      noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an\r\n      ague.\n“Ah, my friend!” said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was in his\r\n      voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before.\r\n      “How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am near sixty,\r\n      dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is awful...” and\r\n      he burst into tears.\nAnna Mikháylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet\r\n      steps.\n“Pierre!” she said.\nPierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his\r\n      forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:\n“He is no more....”\nPierre looked at her over his spectacles.\n“Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as\r\n      tears.”\nShe led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could\r\n      see his face. Anna Mikháylovna left him, and when she returned he was fast\r\n      asleep with his head on his arm.\nIn the morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pierre:\n“Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But\r\n      God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an\r\n      immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you well enough\r\n      to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes duties on\r\n      you, and you must be a man.”\nPierre was silent.\n“Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been\r\n      there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised\r\n      me only the day before yesterday not to forget Borís. But he had no time.\r\n      I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father’s wish?”\nPierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence\r\n      at Princess Anna Mikháylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna Mikháylovna\r\n      returned to the Rostóvs’ and went to bed. On waking in the morning she\r\n      told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezúkhov’s\r\n      death. She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die, that\r\n      his end was not only touching but edifying. As to the last meeting between\r\n      father and son, it was so touching that she could not think of it without\r\n      tears, and did not know which had behaved better during those awful\r\n      moments—the father who so remembered everything and everybody at\r\n      last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had\r\n      been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard\r\n      to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father. “It is painful, but it\r\n      does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and\r\n      his worthy son,” said she. Of the behavior of the eldest princess and\r\n      Prince Vasíli she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great\r\n      secret."

    "text": "At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andréevich Bolkónski’s estate, the arrival\r\n      of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this\r\n      expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince’s\r\n      household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich (nicknamed in\r\n      society, “the King of Prussia”) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him\r\n      to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter,\r\n      Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the\r\n      new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to\r\n      live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could\r\n      come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed\r\n      no one and nothing. He used to say that there are only two sources of\r\n      human vice—idleness and superstition, and only two virtues—activity\r\n      and intelligence. He himself undertook his daughter’s education, and to\r\n      develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and\r\n      geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time\r\n      was occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving\r\n      problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in\r\n      the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on at his\r\n      estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity,\r\n      regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of\r\n      exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions,\r\n      and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about\r\n      him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably\r\n      exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear\r\n      and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was in\r\n      retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high\r\n      official appointed to the province in which the prince’s estate lay\r\n      considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber\r\n      just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince\r\n      appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this\r\n      antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the\r\n      enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small\r\n      old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows\r\n      which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully\r\n      glittering eyes.\nOn the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess\r\n      Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the\r\n      morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent\r\n      prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning prayed that\r\n      the daily interview might pass off well.\nAn old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly\r\n      and said in a whisper: “Please walk in.”\nThrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly\r\n      opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the\r\n      entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round\r\n      continued his work.\nThe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use. The large\r\n      table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted bookcases with\r\n      keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while standing up, on which\r\n      lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and\r\n      shavings scattered around—all indicated continuous, varied, and\r\n      orderly activity. The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot\r\n      embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand,\r\n      showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor\r\n      of hardy old age. After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot\r\n      from the pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached\r\n      to the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter. He never\r\n      gave his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as\r\n      yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively, said severely:\n“Quite well? All right then, sit down.” He took the exercise book\r\n      containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with\r\n      his foot.\n“For tomorrow!” said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch\r\n      from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.\nThe princess bent over the exercise book on the table.\n“Wait a bit, here’s a letter for you,” said the old man suddenly, taking a\r\n      letter addressed in a woman’s hand from a bag hanging above the table,\r\n      onto which he threw it.\nAt the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess’\r\n      face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.\n“From Héloïse?” asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still\r\n      sound, yellowish teeth.\n“Yes, it’s from Julie,” replied the princess with a timid glance and a\r\n      timid smile.\n“I’ll let two more letters pass, but the third I’ll read,” said the prince\r\n      sternly; “I’m afraid you write much nonsense. I’ll read the third!”\n“Read this if you like, Father,” said the princess, blushing still more\r\n      and holding out the letter.\n“The third, I said the third!” cried the prince abruptly, pushing the\r\n      letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the\r\n      exercise book containing geometrical figures.\n“Well, madam,” he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter and\r\n      placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that she felt\r\n      herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco,\r\n      which she had known so long. “Now, madam, these triangles are equal;\r\n      please note that the angleABC...”\nThe princess looked in a scared way at her father’s eyes glittering close\r\n      to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that\r\n      she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent\r\n      her understanding any of her father’s further explanations, however clear\r\n      they might be. Whether it was the teacher’s fault or the pupil’s, this\r\n      same thing happened every day: the princess’ eyes grew dim, she could not\r\n      see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern\r\n      father’s withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him,\r\n      and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make\r\n      out the problem in peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair\r\n      on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to\r\n      control himself and not become vehement, but almost always did become\r\n      vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.\nThe princess gave a wrong answer.\n“Well now, isn’t she a fool!” shouted the prince, pushing the book aside\r\n      and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and down,\r\n      lightly touched his daughter’s hair and sat down again.\nHe drew up his chair, and continued to explain.\n“This won’t do, Princess; it won’t do,” said he, when Princess Mary,\r\n      having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day’s lesson, was\r\n      about to leave: “Mathematics are most important, madam! I don’t want to\r\n      have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and you’ll like it,” and he\r\n      patted her cheek. “It will drive all the nonsense out of your head.”\nShe turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book\r\n      from the high desk.\n“Here is some sort ofKey to the Mysteriesthat your Héloïse has\r\n      sent you. Religious! I don’t interfere with anyone’s belief... I have\r\n      looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.”\nHe patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.\nPrincess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that\r\n      rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She sat\r\n      down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and which\r\n      was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as her\r\n      father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal\r\n      of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from childhood; that\r\n      same Julie Karágina who had been at the Rostóvs’ name-day party.\nJulie wrote in French:\nDear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is\r\n      separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness\r\n      are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us our\r\n      hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against fate and\r\n      in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot overcome a\r\n      certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted. Why\r\n      are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue\r\n      sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw\r\n      fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a\r\n      look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write?\nHaving read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror\r\n      which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin\r\n      face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness at her\r\n      reflection in the glass. “She flatters me,” thought the princess, turning\r\n      away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter her friend, the\r\n      princess’ eyes—large, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times\r\n      there radiated from them shafts of warm light)—were so beautiful\r\n      that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an\r\n      attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the princess never saw\r\n      the beautiful expression of her own eyes—the look they had when she\r\n      was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her face assumed a forced\r\n      unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on\r\n      reading:\nAll Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already\r\n      abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march to\r\n      the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought\r\n      intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant\r\n      that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be\r\n      overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His goodness,\r\n      to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this war has\r\n      deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean young\r\n      Nicholas Rostóv, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive\r\n      and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to you, dear\r\n      Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a\r\n      great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is\r\n      so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds\r\n      nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank and\r\n      has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him,\r\n      transient as they were, have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor\r\n      heart, which has already suffered so much. Someday I will tell you about\r\n      our parting and all that was said then. That is still too fresh. Ah, dear\r\n      friend, you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows. You are\r\n      fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I know very well\r\n      that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but\r\n      this sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart\r\n      needed. But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow\r\n      gossips, is the death of old Count Bezúkhov, and his inheritance. Fancy!\r\n      The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vasíli nothing, and\r\n      it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides\r\n      been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezúkhov and\r\n      possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince\r\n      Vasíli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned\r\n      to Petersburg quite crestfallen.\nI confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and\r\n      inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to\r\n      know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezúkhov and the owner of\r\n      one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the\r\n      change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable\r\n      daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between\r\n      you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past\r\n      two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most\r\n      of whom I don’t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak\r\n      of me as the future Countess Bezúkhova. But you will understand that I\r\n      have no desire for the post.À proposof marriages: do you know\r\n      that a while ago thatuniversal auntieAnna Mikháylovna told me,\r\n      under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is\r\n      neither more nor less than with Prince Vasíli’s son Anatole, whom they\r\n      wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich anddistinguée, and\r\n      it is on you that his relations’ choice has fallen. I don’t know what you\r\n      will think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is\r\n      said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have\r\n      been able to find out about him.\nBut enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and\r\n      Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apráksins’. Read the mystical\r\n      book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though there are\r\n      things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it is an\r\n      admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give my respects\r\n      to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle Bourienne. I\r\n      embrace you as I love you.\nJULIE\nP.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.\nThe princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes\r\n      lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly rose\r\n      and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of paper\r\n      and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote, also in\r\n      French:\nDear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great\r\n      delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which you\r\n      say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect on\r\n      you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if Idaredcomplain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if we had not\r\n      religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you suppose that I\r\n      should look severely on your affection for that young man? On such matters\r\n      I am only severe with myself. I understand such feelings in others, and if\r\n      never having felt them I cannot approve of them, neither do I condemn\r\n      them. Only it seems to me that Christian love, love of one’s neighbor,\r\n      love of one’s enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings\r\n      which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and\r\n      loving young girl like yourself.\nThe news of Count Bezúkhov’s death reached us before your letter and my\r\n      father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last\r\n      representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own turn\r\n      now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as\r\n      possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!\nI cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always\r\n      seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value\r\n      most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince\r\n      Vasíli, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine Saviour’s\r\n      words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle\r\n      than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly true. I pity\r\n      Prince Vasíli but am still more sorry for Pierre. So young, and burdened\r\n      with such riches—to what temptations he will be exposed! If I were\r\n      asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be poorer than the\r\n      poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have\r\n      sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me that\r\n      among some good things it contains others which our weak human\r\n      understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in\r\n      reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I never\r\n      could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds\r\n      by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite\r\n      their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to\r\n      Christian simplicity. Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels. Let us\r\n      not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain; for how can we,\r\n      miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of\r\n      Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil\r\n      between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying\r\n      those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance\r\n      here below. Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be\r\n      persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we\r\n      shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him;\r\n      and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from\r\n      us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine\r\n      Spirit.\nMy father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he\r\n      has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasíli. In\r\n      regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet\r\n      friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must\r\n      conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the\r\n      duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as\r\n      faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings\r\n      toward him whom He may give me for husband.\nI have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival at\r\n      Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one, however,\r\n      for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we\r\n      have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you are—at the\r\n      heart of affairs and of the world—is the talk all of war, even here\r\n      amid fieldwork and the calm of nature—which townsfolk consider\r\n      characteristic of the country—rumors of war are heard and painfully\r\n      felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of\r\n      which I understand nothing; and the day before yesterday during my daily\r\n      walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene.... It was a\r\n      convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the\r\n      army. You should have seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children\r\n      of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs. It seems as\r\n      though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached\r\n      love and forgiveness of injuries—and that men attribute the greatest\r\n      merit to skill in killing one another.\nAdieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy\r\n      Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!\nMARY\n“Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched\r\n      mine. I have written to my poor mother,” said the smiling Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with gutturalr’s.\r\n      She brought into Princess Mary’s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a\r\n      quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied.\n“Princess, I must warn you,” she added, lowering her voice and evidently\r\n      listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggeratedgrasseyement,\r\n      “the prince has been scolding Michael Ivánovich. He is in a very bad\r\n      humor, very morose. Be prepared.”\n“Ah, dear friend,” replied Princess Mary, “I have asked you never to warn\r\n      me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge him and\r\n      would not have others do so.”\nThe princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes\r\n      late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting\r\n      room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o’clock, as the day was\r\n      mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord."

    "text": "The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the\r\n      prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house through\r\n      the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages—twenty times\r\n      repeated—of a sonata by Dussek.\nJust then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch.\r\n      Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to alight,\r\n      and let her pass into the house before him. Old Tíkhon, wearing a wig, put\r\n      his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in a whisper that\r\n      the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door. Tíkhon knew that\r\n      neither the son’s arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to\r\n      disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew this\r\n      as well as Tíkhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his\r\n      father’s habits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured\r\n      himself that they had not, he turned to his wife.\n“He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary’s room,” he\r\n      said.\nThe little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes and\r\n      her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as\r\n      merrily and prettily as ever.\n“Why, this is a palace!” she said to her husband, looking around with the\r\n      expression with which people compliment their host at a ball. “Let’s come,\r\n      quick, quick!” And with a glance round, she smiled at Tíkhon, at her\r\n      husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.\n“Is that Mary practicing? Let’s go quietly and take her by surprise.”\nPrince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.\n“You’ve grown older, Tíkhon,” he said in passing to the old man, who\r\n      kissed his hand.\nBefore they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came,\r\n      the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne, rushed out\r\n      apparently beside herself with delight.\n“Ah! what joy for the princess!” exclaimed she: “At last! I must let her\r\n      know.”\n“No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,” said the little\r\n      princess, kissing her. “I know you already through my sister-in-law’s\r\n      friendship for you. She was not expecting us?”\nThey went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of\r\n      the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and made a\r\n      grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.\nThe little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the middle,\r\n      a cry was heard, then Princess Mary’s heavy tread and the sound of\r\n      kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only met\r\n      once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each other’s arms\r\n      warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch.\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart,\r\n      with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh.\r\n      Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do\r\n      when they hear a false note. The two women let go of one another, and\r\n      then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each other’s hands, kissing\r\n      them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other on the\r\n      face, and then to Prince Andrew’s surprise both began to cry and kissed\r\n      again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew evidently\r\n      felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they\r\n      should cry, and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have\r\n      been otherwise at this meeting.\n“Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...” they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed.\r\n      “I dreamed last night...”—“You were not expecting us?...” “Ah! Mary,\r\n      you have got thinner?...” “And you have grown stouter!...”\n“I knew the princess at once,” put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n“And I had no idea!...” exclaimed Princess Mary. “Ah, Andrew, I did not\r\n      see you.”\nPrince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and he\r\n      told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had turned\r\n      toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm, gentle look of\r\n      her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment, rested on Prince\r\n      Andrew’s face.\nThe little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip\r\n      continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and\r\n      drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of\r\n      glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had had\r\n      on the Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in her\r\n      condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all\r\n      her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to\r\n      dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Odýntsova\r\n      had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one,\r\n      but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was still looking\r\n      silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and\r\n      sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of thought\r\n      independent of her sister-in-law’s words. In the midst of a description of\r\n      the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:\n“So you are really going to the war, Andrew?” she said sighing.\nLise sighed too.\n“Yes, and even tomorrow,” replied her brother.\n“He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had\r\n      promotion...”\nPrincess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of\r\n      thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.\n“Is it certain?” she said.\nThe face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: “Yes, quite\r\n      certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...”\nHer lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law’s and\r\n      unexpectedly again began to cry.\n“She needs rest,” said Prince Andrew with a frown. “Don’t you, Lise? Take\r\n      her to your room and I’ll go to Father. How is he? Just the same?”\n“Yes, just the same. Though I don’t know what your opinion will be,”\r\n       answered the princess joyfully.\n“And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the lathe?”\r\n       asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that,\r\n      in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was aware of his\r\n      weaknesses.\n“The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my\r\n      geometry lessons,” said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons in\r\n      geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.\nWhen the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old\r\n      prince to get up, Tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father. The\r\n      old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son’s\r\n      arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed\r\n      for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing\r\n      an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his\r\n      father’s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore\r\n      in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to\r\n      Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair, wrapped\r\n      in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tíkhon.\n“Ah! here’s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?” said the old man,\r\n      shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tíkhon was holding\r\n      fast to plait, would allow.\n“You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this\r\n      he’ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?” And he held out\r\n      his cheek.\nThe old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He used to\r\n      say that a nap “after dinner was silver—before dinner, golden.”) He\r\n      cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy\r\n      eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot\r\n      indicated to him. He made no reply on his father’s favorite topic—making\r\n      fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte.\n“Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,”\r\n       said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father’s face with an\r\n      eager and respectful look. “How is your health?”\n“Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from\r\n      morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.”\n“Thank God,” said his son smiling.\n“God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,” he continued, returning to\r\n      his hobby; “tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by\r\n      this new science you call ‘strategy.’”\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n“Give me time to collect my wits, Father,” said he, with a smile that\r\n      showed that his father’s foibles did not prevent his son from loving and\r\n      honoring him. “Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!”\n“Nonsense, nonsense!” cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see\r\n      whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. “The house\r\n      for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and show her\r\n      over, and they’ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That’s their woman’s way! I\r\n      am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About Mikhelson’s army I\r\n      understand—Tolstóy‘s too... a simultaneous expedition.... But\r\n      what’s the southern army to do? Prussia is neutral... I know that. What\r\n      about Austria?” said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the\r\n      room followed by Tíkhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles\r\n      of clothing. “What of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?”\nPrince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began—at first\r\n      reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit\r\n      changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on—to\r\n      explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an\r\n      army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her\r\n      out of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was\r\n      to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty\r\n      thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in\r\n      Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English\r\n      were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand men\r\n      was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did not\r\n      evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were not\r\n      listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three times\r\n      unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: “The white one,\r\n      the white one!”\nThis meant that Tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.\r\n      Another time he interrupted, saying:\n“And will she soon be confined?” and shaking his head reproachfully said:\r\n      “That’s bad! Go on, go on.”\nThe third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his\r\n      description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:“Malbrook s’en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.”*\n* “Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he’ll\r\n     return.”\nHis son only smiled.\n“I don’t say it’s a plan I approve of,” said the son; “I am only telling\r\n      you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than\r\n      this one.”\n“Well, you’ve told me nothing new,” and the old man repeated, meditatively\r\n      and rapidly:\n“Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.”"

    "text": "At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the dining\r\n      room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle Bourienne\r\n      were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a strange\r\n      caprice of his employer’s was admitted to table though the position of\r\n      that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused\r\n      him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to\r\n      social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government\r\n      officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivánovich (who\r\n      always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to\r\n      illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once\r\n      impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivánovich was “not a whit worse\r\n      than you or I.” At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael\r\n      Ivánovich more often than to anyone else.\nIn the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly\r\n      lofty, the members of the household and the footmen—one behind each\r\n      chair—stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head butler, napkin\r\n      on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to the\r\n      footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the\r\n      prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new\r\n      to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkónski,\r\n      opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait\r\n      (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling\r\n      prince, in a crown—an alleged descendant of Rúrik and ancestor of\r\n      the Bolkónskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that genealogical tree,\r\n      shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so\r\n      characteristic of the original as to be amusing.\n“How thoroughly like him that is!” he said to Princess Mary, who had come\r\n      up to him.\nPrincess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand\r\n      what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with\r\n      reverence and was beyond question.\n“Everyone has his Achilles’ heel,” continued Prince Andrew. “Fancy, withhispowerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!”\nPrincess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother’s criticism\r\n      and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard coming from\r\n      the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont, as\r\n      if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict\r\n      formality of his house. At that moment the great clock struck two and\r\n      another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room. The prince\r\n      stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy\r\n      eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess.\r\n      She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and\r\n      respect which the old man inspired in all around him. He stroked her hair\r\n      and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck.\n“I’m glad, glad, to see you,” he said, looking attentively into her eyes,\r\n      and then quickly went to his place and sat down. “Sit down, sit down! Sit\r\n      down, Michael Ivánovich!”\nHe indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved\r\n      the chair for her.\n“Ho, ho!” said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.\r\n      “You’ve been in a hurry. That’s bad!”\nHe laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only and\r\n      not with his eyes.\n“You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,” he said.\nThe little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was\r\n      silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and she\r\n      began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and she\r\n      became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from\r\n      various people and retelling the town gossip.\n“Countess Apráksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried\r\n      her eyes out,” she said, growing more and more lively.\nAs she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and\r\n      suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite\r\n      idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Ivánovich.\n“Well, Michael Ivánovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it.\r\n      Prince Andrew” (he always spoke thus of his son) “has been telling me what\r\n      forces are being collected against him! While you and I never thought much\r\n      of him.”\nMichael Ivánovich did not at all know when “you and I” had said such\r\n      things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on\r\n      which to hang the prince’s favorite topic, he looked inquiringly at the\r\n      young prince, wondering what would follow.\n“He is a great tactician!” said the prince to his son, pointing to the\r\n      architect.\nAnd the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the\r\n      generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not\r\n      only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B\r\n      C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little\r\n      Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any Potëmkins or\r\n      Suvórovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no\r\n      political difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of\r\n      puppet show at which the men of the day were playing, pretending to do\r\n      something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father’s ridicule of the\r\n      new men, and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure.\n“The past always seems good,” said he, “but did not Suvórov himself fall\r\n      into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?”\n“Who told you that? Who?” cried the prince. “Suvórov!” And he jerked away\r\n      his plate, which Tíkhon briskly caught. “Suvórov!... Consider, Prince\r\n      Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suvórov; Moreau!... Moreau would have been a\r\n      prisoner if Suvórov had had a free hand; but he had theHofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rathon his hands. It would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there\r\n      you’ll find out what thoseHofs-kriegs-wurst-Rathsare! Suvórov\r\n      couldn’t manage them so what chance has Michael Kutúzov? No, my dear boy,”\r\n       he continued, “you and your generals won’t get on against Buonaparte;\r\n      you’ll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight\r\n      together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to\r\n      fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,” he said, alluding to the invitation made\r\n      that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... “Wonderful!... Were\r\n      the Potëmkins, Suvórovs, and Orlóvs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows\r\n      have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you, but\r\n      we’ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great commander among\r\n      them! Hm!...”\n“I don’t at all say that all the plans are good,” said Prince Andrew, “I\r\n      am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may laugh as much as\r\n      you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!”\n“Michael Ivánovich!” cried the old prince to the architect who, busy with\r\n      his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: “Didn’t I tell you Buonaparte\r\n      was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.”\n“To be sure, your excellency,” replied the architect.\nThe prince again laughed his frigid laugh.\n“Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got splendid\r\n      soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only idlers have\r\n      failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody has beaten the\r\n      Germans. They beat no one—except one another. He made his reputation\r\n      fighting them.”\nAnd the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to him,\r\n      Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His son made no\r\n      rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he\r\n      was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He listened,\r\n      refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this old man,\r\n      living alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss so\r\n      minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political\r\n      events.\n“You think I’m an old man and don’t understand the present state of\r\n      affairs?” concluded his father. “But it troubles me. I don’t sleep at\r\n      night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?”\r\n       he concluded.\n“That would take too long to tell,” answered the son.\n“Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here’s\r\n      another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,” he exclaimed in\r\n      excellent French.\n“You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!”\n“Dieu sait quand reviendra.”hummed the prince out of tune and,\r\n      with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.\nThe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner\r\n      sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her father-in-law and\r\n      now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she took her\r\n      sister-in-law’s arm and drew her into another room.\n“What a clever man your father is,” said she; “perhaps that is why I am\r\n      afraid of him.”\n“Oh, he is so kind!” answered Princess Mary."

    "text": "Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering his\r\n      routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in her\r\n      sister-in-law’s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes\r\n      had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him. After\r\n      inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he ordered\r\n      the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept with him\r\n      remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted with silver\r\n      plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber—a present from his father who\r\n      had brought it from the siege of Ochákov. All these traveling effects of\r\n      Prince Andrew’s were in very good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers\r\n      carefully tied with tapes.\nWhen starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable of\r\n      reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments one\r\n      reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew’s face looked\r\n      very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced briskly\r\n      from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him and\r\n      thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad\r\n      at leaving his wife?—perhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to\r\n      be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly\r\n      unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small\r\n      box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression. It was\r\n      the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.\n“I hear you have given orders to harness,” she cried, panting (she had\r\n      apparently been running), “and I did so wish to have another talk with you\r\n      alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not angry with\r\n      me for coming? You have changed so, Andrúsha,” she added, as if to explain\r\n      such a question.\nShe smiled as she uttered his pet name, “Andrúsha.” It was obviously\r\n      strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrúsha—the\r\n      slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood.\n“And where is Lise?” he asked, answering her question only by a smile.\n“She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room. Oh,\r\n      Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,” said she, sitting down on the\r\n      sofa, facing her brother. “She is quite a child: such a dear, merry child.\r\n      I have grown so fond of her.”\nPrince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and\r\n      contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.\n“One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,\r\n      Andrew? Don’t forget that she has grown up and been educated in society,\r\n      and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into everyone’s\r\n      situation.Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner. * Think what it\r\n      must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to, to be parted\r\n      from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her condition! It’s\r\n      very hard.”\n* To understand all is to forgive all.\nPrince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we\r\n      think we thoroughly understand.\n“You live in the country and don’t think the life terrible,” he replied.\n“I... that’s different. Why speak of me? I don’t want any other life, and\r\n      can’t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young society woman\r\n      to be buried in the country during the best years of her life, all alone—for\r\n      Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what poor resources I have\r\n      for entertaining a woman used to the best society. There is only\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne....”\n“I don’t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,” said Prince Andrew.\n“No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she’s much to be pitied.\r\n      She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don’t need her, and she’s\r\n      even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I\r\n      like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Ivánovich\r\n      are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has\r\n      been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: ‘We don’t love people so\r\n      much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.’\r\n      Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is\r\n      very good-natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to\r\n      him in the evenings and reads splendidly.”\n“To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father’s character sometimes makes\r\n      things trying for you, doesn’t it?” Prince Andrew asked suddenly.\nPrincess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.\n“For me? For me?... Trying for me!...” said she.\n“He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he’s getting very\r\n      trying,” said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father\r\n      in order to puzzle or test his sister.\n“You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual\r\n      pride,” said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather\r\n      than the trend of the conversation—“and that’s a great sin. How can\r\n      one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration\r\n      could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with\r\n      him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am.”\nHer brother shook his head incredulously.\n“The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,\r\n      Andrew... is Father’s way of treating religious subjects. I don’t\r\n      understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as\r\n      clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing that makes\r\n      me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of improvement. His\r\n      satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a monk he received and\r\n      had a long talk with.”\n“Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder,” said\r\n      Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.\n“Ah!mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.\r\n      Andrew...” she said timidly after a moment’s silence, “I have a great\r\n      favor to ask of you.”\n“What is it, dear?”\n“No—promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble\r\n      and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,\r\n      Andrúsha!...” said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet\r\n      taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the\r\n      subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was\r\n      granted.\nShe looked timidly at her brother.\n“Even if it were a great deal of trouble...” answered Prince Andrew, as if\r\n      guessing what it was about.\n“Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as you\r\n      please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father’s father, our\r\n      grandfather, wore it in all his wars.” (She still did not take out what\r\n      she was holding in her reticule.) “So you promise?”\n“Of course. What is it?”\n“Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never\r\n      take it off. Do you promise?”\n“If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won’t break my neck... To please\r\n      you...” said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the pained\r\n      expression his joke had brought to his sister’s face, he repented and\r\n      added: “I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.”\n“Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to\r\n      Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,” said she in a voice\r\n      trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her\r\n      brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold\r\n      setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.\nShe crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.\n“Please, Andrew, for my sake!...”\nRays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit up\r\n      the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother\r\n      would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood, crossed\r\n      himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for he was\r\n      touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.\n“Thank you, my dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on\r\n      the sofa. They were silent for a while.\n“As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always used\r\n      to be. Don’t judge Lise harshly,” she began. “She is so sweet, so\r\n      good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.”\n“I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Másha, or blamed her.\r\n      Why do you say all this to me?”\nRed patches appeared on Princess Mary’s face and she was silent as if she\r\n      felt guilty.\n“I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And I am\r\n      sorry for that,” he went on.\nThe patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to\r\n      say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little\r\n      princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings\r\n      about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her\r\n      fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen\r\n      asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.\n“Know this, Másha: I can’t reproach, have not reproached, and never shall\r\n      reproachmy wifewith anything, and I cannot reproach myself with\r\n      anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever\r\n      circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if you\r\n      want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this is so\r\n      I don’t know...”\nAs he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed her\r\n      forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed\r\n      brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward\r\n      the darkness of the open doorway.\n“Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or—go and wake and I’ll come\r\n      in a moment. Petrúshka!” he called to his valet: “Come here, take these\r\n      away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.”\nPrincess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said: “Andrew,\r\n      if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him to give you\r\n      the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been answered.”\n“Well, maybe!” said Prince Andrew. “Go, Másha; I’ll come immediately.”\nOn the way to his sister’s room, in the passage which connected one wing\r\n      with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly.\r\n      It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and artless smile,\r\n      she had met him in secluded passages.\n“Oh! I thought you were in your room,” she said, for some reason blushing\r\n      and dropping her eyes.\nPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly\r\n      came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and\r\n      hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the Frenchwoman\r\n      blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his sister’s room\r\n      his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying one word after\r\n      another, came through the open door. She was speaking as usual in French,\r\n      and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make up for lost time.\n“No, but imagine the old Countess Zúbova, with false curls and her mouth\r\n      full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age.... Ha, ha,\r\n      ha! Mary!”\nThis very sentence about Countess Zúbova and this same laugh Prince Andrew\r\n      had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times.\r\n      He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and rosy, was\r\n      sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking incessantly,\r\n      repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince Andrew came\r\n      up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey.\r\n      She answered him and continued her chatter.\nThe coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn\r\n      night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole. Servants\r\n      with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense house was\r\n      brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The domestic\r\n      serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to the young\r\n      prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the reception\r\n      hall: Michael Ivánovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the\r\n      little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his father’s study as\r\n      the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All were waiting for them\r\n      to come out.\nWhen Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age spectacles\r\n      and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his son, sat at\r\n      the table writing. He glanced round.\n“Going?” And he went on writing.\n“I’ve come to say good-by.”\n“Kiss me here,” and he touched his cheek: “Thanks, thanks!”\n“What do you thank me for?”\n“For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman’s apron strings. The\r\n      Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!” And he went on writing, so\r\n      that his quill spluttered and squeaked. “If you have anything to say, say\r\n      it. These two things can be done together,” he added.\n“About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands....”\n“Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.”\n“When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for anaccoucheur....\r\n      Let him be here....”\nThe old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his\r\n      stern eyes on his son.\n“I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,” said Prince\r\n      Andrew, evidently confused. “I know that out of a million cases only one\r\n      goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been telling her\r\n      things. She has had a dream and is frightened.”\n“Hm... Hm...” muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was\r\n      writing. “I’ll do it.”\nHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh.\n“It’s a bad business, eh?”\n“What is bad, Father?”\n“The wife!” said the old prince, briefly and significantly.\n“I don’t understand!” said Prince Andrew.\n“No, it can’t be helped, lad,” said the prince. “They’re all like that;\r\n      one can’t unmarry. Don’t be afraid; I won’t tell anyone, but you know it\r\n      yourself.”\nHe seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked\r\n      straight into his son’s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through\r\n      him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.\nThe son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The old\r\n      man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing down\r\n      the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.\n“What’s to be done? She’s pretty! I will do everything. Make your mind\r\n      easy,” said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.\nAndrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father\r\n      understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.\n“Listen!” said he; “don’t worry about your wife: what can be done shall\r\n      be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilariónovich. * I have written\r\n      that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as\r\n      an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember and like him. Write and\r\n      tell me how he receives you. If he is all right—serve him. Nicholas\r\n      Bolkónski’s son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor. Now come\r\n      here.”\n* Kutúzov.\nHe spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son was\r\n      accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the lid, drew\r\n      out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his bold, tall,\r\n      close handwriting.\n“I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs; hand\r\n      them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond and a\r\n      letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvórov’s\r\n      wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for you to read when\r\n      I am gone. You will find them useful.”\nAndrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time\r\n      yet. He felt that he must not say it.\n“I will do it all, Father,” he said.\n“Well, now, good-by!” He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced him.\r\n      “Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me, your old\r\n      father...” he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly\r\n      shrieked: “but if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas\r\n      Bolkónski, I shall be ashamed!”\n“You need not have said that to me, Father,” said the son with a smile.\nThe old man was silent.\n“I also wanted to ask you,” continued Prince Andrew, “if I’m killed and if\r\n      I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you—as I said\r\n      yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.”\n“Not let the wife have him?” said the old man, and laughed.\nThey stood silent, facing one another. The old man’s sharp eyes were fixed\r\n      straight on his son’s. Something twitched in the lower part of the old\r\n      prince’s face.\n“We’ve said good-by. Go!” he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry voice,\r\n      opening his door.\n“What is it? What?” asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at\r\n      the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing\r\n      gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.\nPrince Andrew sighed and made no reply.\n“Well!” he said, turning to his wife.\nAnd this “Well!” sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: “Now go\r\n      through your performance.”\n“Andrew, already!” said the little princess, turning pale and looking with\r\n      dismay at her husband.\nHe embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.\nHe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,\r\n      and carefully placed her in an easy chair.\n“Adieu, Mary,” said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and\r\n      kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.\nThe little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing\r\n      her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked\r\n      with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince\r\n      Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From the\r\n      study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man angrily\r\n      blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened\r\n      quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown\r\n      looked out.\n“Gone? That’s all right!” said he; and looking angrily at the unconscious\r\n      little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER I",
    "text": "In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of\r\n      the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from\r\n      Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the\r\n      inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of\r\n      the commander in chief, Kutúzov.\nOn October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached\r\n      Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected by\r\n      the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the locality\r\n      and surroundings—fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and hills\r\n      in the distance—and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed\r\n      with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment had just\r\n      the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection\r\n      anywhere in the heart of Russia.\nOn the evening of the last day’s march an order had been received that the\r\n      commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though the\r\n      words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the\r\n      question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it\r\n      was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present\r\n      the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is always better to\r\n      “bow too low than not bow low enough.” So the soldiers, after a\r\n      twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without\r\n      closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated\r\n      and reckoned, and by morning the regiment—instead of the straggling,\r\n      disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before—presented\r\n      a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and\r\n      his duty, had every button and every strap in place, and shone with\r\n      cleanliness. And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased\r\n      the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on\r\n      every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of\r\n      articles, “awl, soap, and all,” as the soldiers say. There was only one\r\n      circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of\r\n      the soldiers’ boots. More than half the men’s boots were in holes. But\r\n      this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in\r\n      spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian\r\n      commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.\nThe commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and\r\n      thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from\r\n      chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform\r\n      showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes\r\n      which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He\r\n      had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of\r\n      his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled\r\n      himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander\r\n      admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was\r\n      engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military\r\n      matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his\r\n      thoughts.\n“Well, Michael Mítrich, sir?” he said, addressing one of the battalion\r\n      commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that they both felt\r\n      happy). “We had our hands full last night. However, I think the regiment\r\n      is not a bad one, eh?”\nThe battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.\n“It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsarítsin Meadow.”\n“What?” asked the commander.\nAt that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been\r\n      posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp followed\r\n      by a Cossack.\nThe aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly\r\n      worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief wished to see\r\n      the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march: in their\r\n      greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation whatever.\nA member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutúzov the day\r\n      before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the\r\n      Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutúzov, not considering this junction\r\n      advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view, to show\r\n      the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from\r\n      Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment; so the worse\r\n      the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander in chief would\r\n      be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he\r\n      nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their\r\n      greatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would\r\n      otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the regimental commander hung\r\n      his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a\r\n      choleric gesture.\n“A fine mess we’ve made of it!” he remarked.\n“There now! Didn’t I tell you, Michael Mítrich, that if it was said ‘on\r\n      the march’ it meant in greatcoats?” said he reproachfully to the battalion\r\n      commander. “Oh, my God!” he added, stepping resolutely forward. “Company\r\n      commanders!” he shouted in a voice accustomed to command. “Sergeants\r\n      major!... How soon will he be here?” he asked the aide-de-camp with a\r\n      respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring\r\n      to.\n“In an hour’s time, I should say.”\n“Shall we have time to change clothes?”\n“I don’t know, General....”\nThe regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the\r\n      soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off\r\n      to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats\r\n      were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up to\r\n      then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum\r\n      with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up\r\n      their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over\r\n      their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with\r\n      upraised arms.\nIn half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray\r\n      instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to\r\n      the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.\n“Whatever is this? This!” he shouted and stood still. “Commander of the\r\n      third company!”\n“Commander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to the\r\n      general... third company to the commander.” The words passed along the\r\n      lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.\nWhen the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a\r\n      cry of: “The general to the third company,” the missing officer appeared\r\n      from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man and not in\r\n      the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the\r\n      general. The captain’s face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is\r\n      told to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose,\r\n      the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth\r\n      twitched nervously. The general looked the captain up and down as he came\r\n      up panting, slackening his pace as he approached.\n“You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?” shouted\r\n      the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a\r\n      soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth,\r\n      which contrasted with the others. “What have you been after? The commander\r\n      in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? I’ll teach you to dress\r\n      the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?”\nThe commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior, pressed\r\n      two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this pressure lay\r\n      his only hope of salvation.\n“Well, why don’t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a\r\n      Hungarian?” said the commander with an austere gibe.\n“Your excellency...”\n“Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your\r\n      excellency?... nobody knows.”\n“Your excellency, it’s the officer Dólokhov, who has been reduced to the\r\n      ranks,” said the captain softly.\n“Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If a\r\n      soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others.”\n“Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.”\n“Gave him leave? Leave? That’s just like you young men,” said the\r\n      regimental commander cooling down a little. “Leave indeed.... One says a\r\n      word to you and you... What?” he added with renewed irritation, “I beg you\r\n      to dress your men decently.”\nAnd the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky\r\n      steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display of anger\r\n      and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath.\r\n      Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another because\r\n      his line was not straight, he reached the third company.\n“H-o-o-w are you standing? Where’s your leg? Your leg?” shouted the\r\n      commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were still\r\n      five men between him and Dólokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.\nDólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his\r\n      clear, insolent eyes in the general’s face.\n“Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat... the\r\n      ras...” he did not finish.\n“General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...” Dólokhov\r\n      hurriedly interrupted.\n“No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!”\n“Not bound to endure insults,” Dólokhov concluded in loud, ringing tones.\nThe eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became silent,\r\n      angrily pulling down his tight scarf.\n“I request you to have the goodness to change your coat,” he said as he\r\n      turned away."

    "text": "“He’s coming!” shouted the signaler at that moment.\nThe regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup\r\n      with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,\r\n      drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening his\r\n      mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird preening\r\n      its plumage and became motionless.\n“Att-ention!” shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice\r\n      which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and welcome\r\n      for the approaching chief.\nAlong the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high,\r\n      light blue Viennesecalèche, slightly creaking on its springs and\r\n      drawn by six horses at a smart trot. Behind thecalèchegalloped\r\n      the suite and a convoy of Croats. Beside Kutúzov sat an Austrian general,\r\n      in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. Thecalèchestopped in front of the regiment. Kutúzov and the Austrian\r\n      general were talking in low voices and Kutúzov smiled slightly as treading\r\n      heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand\r\n      men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist.\nThe word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a\r\n      jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the feeble\r\n      voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared, “Health to\r\n      your ex... len... len... lency!” and again all became silent. At first\r\n      Kutúzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he and the general in\r\n      white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.\nFrom the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and\r\n      devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from the\r\n      way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward and\r\n      hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he darted\r\n      forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief, it was evident\r\n      that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than\r\n      his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its\r\n      commander the regiment, in comparison with others that had reached Braunau\r\n      at the same time, was in splendid condition. There were only 217 sick and\r\n      stragglers. Everything was in good order except the boots.\nKutúzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few friendly\r\n      words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes also to the\r\n      soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly,\r\n      pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed\r\n      to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help noticing what a\r\n      bad state of things it was. The regimental commander ran forward on each\r\n      such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief’s\r\n      regarding the regiment. Behind Kutúzov, at a distance that allowed every\r\n      softly spoken word to be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite.\r\n      These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed. Nearest of\r\n      all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant. This was Prince\r\n      Bolkónski. Beside him was his comrade Nesvítski, a tall staff officer,\r\n      extremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes.\r\n      Nesvítski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar\r\n      officer who walked beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and without\r\n      a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the\r\n      regimental commander’s back and mimicked his every movement. Each time the\r\n      commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward in\r\n      exactly the same manner. Nesvítski laughed and nudged the others to make\r\n      them look at the wag.\nKutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were\r\n      starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the third\r\n      company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this,\r\n      involuntarily came closer to him.\n“Ah, Timókhin!” said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been\r\n      reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.\nOne would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more\r\n      than Timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental\r\n      commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew\r\n      himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it\r\n      had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutúzov, who\r\n      evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good, quickly\r\n      turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and\r\n      puffy face.\n“Another Ismail comrade,” said he. “A brave officer! Are you satisfied\r\n      with him?” he asked the regimental commander.\nAnd the latter—unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar\r\n      officer as in a looking glass—started, moved forward, and answered:\r\n      “Highly satisfied, your excellency!”\n“We all have our weaknesses,” said Kutúzov smiling and walking away from\r\n      him. “He used to have a predilection for Bacchus.”\nThe regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did\r\n      not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed\r\n      captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose\r\n      with such exactitude that Nesvítski could not help laughing. Kutúzov\r\n      turned round. The officer evidently had complete control of his face, and\r\n      while Kutúzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most\r\n      serious, deferential, and innocent expression.\nThe third company was the last, and Kutúzov pondered, apparently trying to\r\n      recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the suite\r\n      and said in French:\n“You told me to remind you of the officer Dólokhov, reduced to the ranks\r\n      in this regiment.”\n“Where is Dólokhov?” asked Kutúzov.\nDólokhov, who had already changed into a soldier’s gray greatcoat, did not\r\n      wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier, with his\r\n      clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the commander\r\n      in chief, and presented arms.\n“Have you a complaint to make?” Kutúzov asked with a slight frown.\n“This is Dólokhov,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Ah!” said Kutúzov. “I hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your duty.\r\n      The Emperor is gracious, and I shan’t forget you if you deserve well.”\nThe clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as\r\n      they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression\r\n      to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so\r\n      widely from a private.\n“One thing I ask of your excellency,” Dólokhov said in his firm, ringing,\r\n      deliberate voice. “I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my\r\n      devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!”\nKutúzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned\r\n      from Captain Timókhin again flitted over his face. He turned away with a\r\n      grimace as if to say that everything Dólokhov had said to him and\r\n      everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was weary of\r\n      it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and went to the\r\n      carriage.\nThe regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed\r\n      quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and\r\n      to rest after their hard marches.\n“You won’t bear me a grudge, Prokhór Ignátych?” said the regimental\r\n      commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and\r\n      riding up to Captain Timókhin who was walking in front. (The regimental\r\n      commander’s face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with\r\n      irrepressible delight.) “It’s in the Emperor’s service... it can’t be\r\n      helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade... I am the first to\r\n      apologize, you know me!... He was very pleased!” And he held out his hand\r\n      to the captain.\n“Don’t mention it, General, as if I’d be so bold!” replied the captain,\r\n      his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth\r\n      were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at Ismail.\n“And tell Mr. Dólokhov that I won’t forget him—he may be quite easy.\r\n      And tell me, please—I’ve been meaning to ask—how is he\r\n      behaving himself, and in general...”\n“As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency; but\r\n      his character...” said Timókhin.\n“And what about his character?” asked the regimental commander.\n“It’s different on different days,” answered the captain. “One day he is\r\n      sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he’s a wild\r\n      beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.”\n“Oh, well, well!” remarked the regimental commander. “Still, one must have\r\n      pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important\r\n      connections... Well, then, you just...”\n“I will, your excellency,” said Timókhin, showing by his smile that he\r\n      understood his commander’s wish.\n“Well, of course, of course!”\nThe regimental commander sought out Dólokhov in the ranks and, reining in\r\n      his horse, said to him:\n“After the next affair... epaulettes.”\nDólokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking smile\r\n      on his lips change.\n“Well, that’s all right,” continued the regimental commander. “A cup of\r\n      vodka for the men from me,” he added so that the soldiers could hear. “I\r\n      thank you all! God be praised!” and he rode past that company and overtook\r\n      the next one.\n“Well, he’s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,” said Timókhin\r\n      to the subaltern beside him.\n“In a word, a hearty one...” said the subaltern, laughing (the regimental\r\n      commander was nicknamedKing of Hearts).\nThe cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the\r\n      soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers’ voices could be\r\n      heard on every side.\n“And they said Kutúzov was blind of one eye?”\n“And so he is! Quite blind!”\n“No, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands... he\r\n      noticed everything...”\n“When he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...”\n“And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were smeared\r\n      with chalk—as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as they\r\n      do the guns.”\n“I say, Fédeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You were\r\n      near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.”\n“Buonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn’t know! The\r\n      Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are putting them\r\n      down. When they’ve been put down, the war with Buonaparte will begin. And\r\n      he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you’re a fool. You’d better listen\r\n      more carefully!”\n“What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is turning\r\n      into the village already... they will have their buckwheat cooked before\r\n      we reach our quarters.”\n“Give me a biscuit, you devil!”\n“And did you give me tobacco yesterday? That’s just it, friend! Ah, well,\r\n      never mind, here you are.”\n“They might call a halt here or we’ll have to do another four miles\r\n      without eating.”\n“Wasn’t it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still and\r\n      are drawn along.”\n“And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all seemed to\r\n      be Poles—all under the Russian crown—but here they’re all\r\n      regular Germans.”\n“Singers to the front” came the captain’s order.\nAnd from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A drummer,\r\n      their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his arm,\r\n      began a long-drawn-out soldiers’ song, commencing with the words:“Morning\r\n      dawned, the sun was rising,”and concluding:“On then, brothers, on to\r\n      glory, led by Father Kámenski.”This song had been composed in the Turkish\r\n      campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only change being that the\r\n      words “Father Kámenski” were replaced by “Father Kutúzov.”\nHaving jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if\r\n      flinging something to the ground, the drummer—a lean, handsome\r\n      soldier of forty—looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his\r\n      eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he\r\n      raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious\r\n      object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly\r\n      flung it down and began:\n“Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!”\n“Oh, my bower new...!”chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet player,\r\n      in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front and,\r\n      walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and flourished\r\n      his castanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers, swinging their arms\r\n      and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long steps. Behind the\r\n      company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs, and the tramp of\r\n      horses’ hoofs were heard. Kutúzov and his suite were returning to the\r\n      town. The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to\r\n      march at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of\r\n      the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly\r\n      marching men. In the second file from the right flank, beside which the\r\n      carriage passed the company, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted\r\n      notice. It was Dólokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in\r\n      time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who\r\n      were not at that moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of\r\n      Kutúzov’s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from\r\n      the carriage and rode up to Dólokhov.\nHussar cornet Zherkóv had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the wild\r\n      set led by Dólokhov. Zherkóv had met Dólokhov abroad as a private and had\r\n      not seen fit to recognize him. But now that Kutúzov had spoken to the\r\n      gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend.\n“My dear fellow, how are you?” said he through the singing, making his\r\n      horse keep pace with the company.\n“How am I?” Dólokhov answered coldly. “I am as you see.”\nThe lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety\r\n      with which Zherkóv spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dólokhov’s\r\n      reply.\n“And how do you get on with the officers?” inquired Zherkóv.\n“All right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the\r\n      staff?”\n“I was attached; I’m on duty.”\nBoth were silent.\n“She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,”went the song,\r\n      arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness. Their\r\n      conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that\r\n      song.\n“Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?” asked Dólokhov.\n“The devil only knows! They say so.”\n“I’m glad,” answered Dólokhov briefly and clearly, as the song demanded.\n“I say, come round some evening and we’ll have a game of faro!” said\r\n      Zherkóv.\n“Why, have you too much money?”\n“Do come.”\n“I can’t. I’ve sworn not to. I won’t drink and won’t play till I get\r\n      reinstated.”\n“Well, that’s only till the first engagement.”\n“We shall see.”\nThey were again silent.\n“Come if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the staff...”\nDólokhov smiled. “Don’t trouble. If I want anything, I won’t beg—I’ll\r\n      take it!”\n“Well, never mind; I only...”\n“And I only...”\n“Good-by.”\n“Good health...”\n“It’s a long, long way.To my native land...”\nZherkóv touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from foot\r\n      to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past\r\n      the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the song."

    "text": "On returning from the review, Kutúzov took the Austrian general into his\r\n      private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers relating to\r\n      the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the letters that had\r\n      come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of the advanced army.\r\n      Prince Andrew Bolkónski came into the room with the required papers.\r\n      Kutúzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the\r\n      table on which a plan was spread out.\n“Ah!...” said Kutúzov glancing at Bolkónski as if by this exclamation he\r\n      was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the conversation in\r\n      French.\n“All I can say, General,” said he with a pleasant elegance of expression\r\n      and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken\r\n      word. It was evident that Kutúzov himself listened with pleasure to his\r\n      own voice. “All I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my\r\n      personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have\r\n      been fulfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And\r\n      believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to\r\n      hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better\r\n      informed and more skillful general—of whom Austria has so many—and\r\n      to lay down all this heavy responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes\r\n      too strong for us, General.”\nAnd Kutúzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, “You are quite at liberty\r\n      not to believe me and I don’t even care whether you do or not, but you\r\n      have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole point.”\nThe Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply\r\n      in the same tone.\n“On the contrary,” he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted\r\n      with his flattering words, “on the contrary, your excellency’s\r\n      participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we\r\n      think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their\r\n      commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their\r\n      battles,” he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence.\nKutúzov bowed with the same smile.\n“But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His\r\n      Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the\r\n      Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General\r\n      Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our\r\n      aid,” said Kutúzov.\nThe general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian\r\n      defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors\r\n      that were afloat, and so Kutúzov’s suggestion of an Austrian victory\r\n      sounded much like irony. But Kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the same\r\n      expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so. And, in\r\n      fact, the last letter he had received from Mack’s army informed him of a\r\n      victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very\r\n      favorable.\n“Give me that letter,” said Kutúzov turning to Prince Andrew. “Please have\r\n      a look at it”—and Kutúzov with an ironical smile about the corners\r\n      of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in\r\n      German, from the Archduke Ferdinand’s letter:\nWe have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with\r\n      which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also, as we\r\n      are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding\r\n      both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross the Lech, we\r\n      can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line of communications,\r\n      recross the river lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to\r\n      direct his whole force against our faithful ally. We shall therefore\r\n      confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army will be fully\r\n      equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with it, easily find a way to\r\n      prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.\nKutúzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member\r\n      of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.\n“But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect the\r\n      worst,” said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done with\r\n      jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the\r\n      aide-de-camp.\n“Excuse me, General,” interrupted Kutúzov, also turning to Prince Andrew.\r\n      “Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlóvski all the reports from our\r\n      scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one from His\r\n      Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these,” he said, handing him\r\n      several papers, “make a neat memorandum in French out of all this, showing\r\n      all the news we have had of the movements of the Austrian army, and then\r\n      give it to his excellency.”\nPrince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first\r\n      not only what had been said but also what Kutúzov would have liked to tell\r\n      him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both, stepped softly over\r\n      the carpet and went out into the waiting room.\nThough not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he\r\n      had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face, in\r\n      his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former\r\n      affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time to\r\n      think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with agreeable\r\n      and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction with himself\r\n      and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter and more\r\n      attractive.\nKutúzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly,\r\n      promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,\r\n      and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions.\r\n      From Vienna Kutúzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrew’s father.\nYour son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry,\r\n      firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a\r\n      subordinate by me.\nOn Kutúzov’s staff, among his fellow officers and in the army generally,\r\n      Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two quite opposite\r\n      reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different from\r\n      themselves and from everyone else, expected great things of him, listened\r\n      to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince Andrew was natural\r\n      and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and considered him\r\n      conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people Prince Andrew\r\n      knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him.\nComing out of Kutúzov’s room into the waiting room with the papers in his\r\n      hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,\r\n      Kozlóvski, who was sitting at the window with a book.\n“Well, Prince?” asked Kozlóvski.\n“I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing.”\n“And why is it?”\nPrince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.\n“Any news from Mack?”\n“No.”\n“If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.”\n“Probably,” said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.\nBut at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the order\r\n      of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head, who had\r\n      evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door. Prince Andrew\r\n      stopped short.\n“Commander in Chief Kutúzov?” said the newly arrived general speaking\r\n      quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and advancing\r\n      straight toward the inner door.\n“The commander in chief is engaged,” said Kozlóvski, going hurriedly up to\r\n      the unknown general and blocking his way to the door. “Whom shall I\r\n      announce?”\nThe unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlóvski, who was rather\r\n      short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.\n“The commander in chief is engaged,” repeated Kozlóvski calmly.\nThe general’s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took out a\r\n      notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the leaf, gave\r\n      it to Kozlóvski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw himself into a\r\n      chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, “Why do they look at me?”\r\n       Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he intended to say\r\n      something, but immediately, with affected indifference, began to hum to\r\n      himself, producing a queer sound which immediately broke off. The door of\r\n      the private room opened and Kutúzov appeared in the doorway. The general\r\n      with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some\r\n      danger, and, making long, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to\r\n      Kutúzov.\n“Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,”he uttered in a broken voice.\nKutúzov’s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile\r\n      for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his\r\n      forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully, closed his\r\n      eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed the door\r\n      himself behind him.\nThe report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten\r\n      and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct.\r\n      Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with\r\n      orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been\r\n      inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.\nPrince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest\r\n      lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the\r\n      details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost,\r\n      understood all the difficulties of the Russian army’s position, and\r\n      vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play.\r\n      Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation\r\n      of arrogant Austria and that in a week’s time he might, perhaps, see and\r\n      take part in the first Russian encounter with the French since Suvórov met\r\n      them. He feared that Bonaparte’s genius might outweigh all the courage of\r\n      the Russian troops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his\r\n      hero being disgraced.\nExcited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his room\r\n      to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor he met\r\n      Nesvítski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherkóv; they were as\r\n      usual laughing.\n“Why are you so glum?” asked Nesvítski noticing Prince Andrew’s pale face\r\n      and glittering eyes.\n“There’s nothing to be gay about,” answered Bolkónski.\nJust as Prince Andrew met Nesvítski and Zherkóv, there came toward them\r\n      from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general who was on\r\n      Kutúzov’s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army, and the\r\n      member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening. There\r\n      was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three\r\n      officers quite easily, but Zherkóv, pushing Nesvítski aside with his arm,\r\n      said in a breathless voice,\n“They’re coming!... they’re coming!... Stand aside, make way, please make\r\n      way!”\nThe generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid\r\n      embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherkóv there suddenly\r\n      appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.\n“Your excellency,” said he in German, stepping forward and addressing the\r\n      Austrian general, “I have the honor to congratulate you.”\nHe bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other,\r\n      awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.\nThe member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the\r\n      seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment’s\r\n      attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.\n“I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite\r\n      well, only a little bruised just here,” he added, pointing with a beaming\r\n      smile to his head.\nThe general frowned, turned away, and went on.\n“Gott, wie naiv!”* said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.\n* “Good God, what simplicity!”\nNesvítski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but Bolkónski,\r\n      turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and turned to\r\n      Zherkóv. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of Mack, the\r\n      news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the Russian army\r\n      found vent in anger at Zherkóv’s untimely jest.\n“If you, sir, choose to make abuffoonof yourself,” he said\r\n      sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, “I can’t prevent\r\n      your doing so; but I warn you that if youdareto play the fool in my\r\n      presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.”\nNesvítski and Zherkóv were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed\r\n      at Bolkónski silently with wide-open eyes.\n“What’s the matter? I only congratulated them,” said Zherkóv.\n“I am not jesting with you; please be silent!” cried Bolkónski, and taking\r\n      Nesvítski’s arm he left Zherkóv, who did not know what to say.\n“Come, what’s the matter, old fellow?” said Nesvítski trying to soothe\r\n      him.\n“What’s the matter?” exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in\r\n      his excitement. “Don’t you understand that either we are officers\r\n      serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the\r\n      misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care nothing\r\n      for their master’s business.Quarante mille hommes massacrés et l’armée de\r\n      nos alliés détruite, et vous trouvez là le mot pour rire,”* he said, as\r\n      if strengthening his views by this French sentence.“C’est bien pour un\r\n      garçon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas\r\n      pour vous, pas pour vous. *(2) Only ahobbledehoycould amuse himself in\r\n      this way,” he added in Russian—but pronouncing the word with a\r\n      French accent—having noticed that Zherkóv could still hear him.\n* “Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies\r\n     destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!”\n* (2) “It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow\r\n     of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for\r\n     you.”\nHe waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned\r\n      and went out of the corridor."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER IV",
    "text": "The Pávlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The squadron\r\n      in which Nicholas Rostóv served as a cadet was quartered in the German\r\n      village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were assigned to\r\n      cavalry-captain Denísov, the squadron commander, known throughout the\r\n      whole cavalry division as Váska Denísov. Cadet Rostóv, ever since he had\r\n      overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the squadron commander.\nOn October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of\r\n      Mack’s defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was\r\n      proceeding as usual. Denísov, who had been losing at cards all night, had\r\n      not yet come home when Rostóv rode back early in the morning from a\r\n      foraging expedition. Rostóv in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his\r\n      horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple\r\n      youthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part\r\n      from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.\n“Ah, Bondarénko, dear friend!” said he to the hussar who rushed up\r\n      headlong to the horse. “Walk him up and down, my dear fellow,” he\r\n      continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young\r\n      people show to everyone when they are happy.\n“Yes, your excellency,” answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his head.\n“Mind, walk him up and down well!”\nAnother hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarénko had already\r\n      thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse’s head. It was\r\n      evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve\r\n      him. Rostóv patted the horse’s neck and then his flank, and lingered for a\r\n      moment.\n“Splendid! What a horse he will be!” he thought with a smile, and holding\r\n      up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the porch. His\r\n      landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in hand, was\r\n      clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face immediately\r\n      brightened on seeing Rostóv.“Schön gut Morgen! Schön gut Morgen!”* he\r\n      said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to greet the young man.\n* “A very good morning! A very good morning!”\n“Schon fleissig?”* said Rostóv with the same gay brotherly smile which\r\n      did not leave his eager face.“Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser\r\n      Alexander hoch!”*(2) said he, quoting words often repeated by the German\r\n      landlord.\n* “Busy already?”\n* (2) “Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians!\r\n     Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!”\nThe German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and\r\n      waving it above his head cried:\n“Und die ganze Welt hoch!”*\n* “And hurrah for the whole world!”\nRostóv waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing,“Und vivat die ganze Welt!”Though neither the German cleaning his cowshed\r\n      nor Rostóv back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for\r\n      rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly\r\n      love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection, and parted\r\n      smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and Rostóv going to the\r\n      cottage he occupied with Denísov.\n“What about your master?” he asked Lavrúshka, Denísov’s orderly, whom all\r\n      the regiment knew for a rogue.\n“Hasn’t been in since the evening. Must have been losing,” answered\r\n      Lavrúshka. “I know by now, if he wins he comes back early to brag about\r\n      it, but if he stays out till morning it means he’s lost and will come back\r\n      in a rage. Will you have coffee?”\n“Yes, bring some.”\nTen minutes later Lavrúshka brought the coffee. “He’s coming!” said he.\r\n      “Now for trouble!” Rostóv looked out of the window and saw Denísov coming\r\n      home. Denísov was a small man with a red face, sparkling black eyes, and\r\n      black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an unfastened cloak, wide\r\n      breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled shako on the back of his\r\n      head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging his head.\n“Lavwúska!” he shouted loudly and angrily, “take it off, blockhead!”\n“Well, I am taking it off,” replied Lavrúshka’s voice.\n“Ah, you’re up already,” said Denísov, entering the room.\n“Long ago,” answered Rostóv, “I have already been for the hay, and have\r\n      seen Fräulein Mathilde.”\n“Weally! And I’ve been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a damned\r\n      fool!” cried Denísov, not pronouncing hisr’s. “Such ill luck! Such ill\r\n      luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo there! Tea!”\nPuckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong teeth,\r\n      he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled\r\n      black hair.\n“And what devil made me go to that wat?” (an officer nicknamed “the rat”)\r\n      he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands. “Just fancy,\r\n      he didn’t let me win a single cahd, not one cahd.”\nHe took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his fist,\r\n      and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he continued to\r\n      shout.\n“He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it;\r\n      gives the singles and snatches the doubles!”\nHe scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away.\r\n      Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully\r\n      with his glittering, black eyes at Rostóv.\n“If at least we had some women here; but there’s nothing foh one to do but\r\n      dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who’s there?” he\r\n      said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the\r\n      clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful cough.\n“The squadron quartermaster!” said Lavrúshka.\nDenísov’s face puckered still more.\n“Wetched!” he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it.\r\n      “Wostóv, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the purse\r\n      undah the pillow,” he said, and went out to the quartermaster.\nRostóv took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins in\r\n      separate piles, began counting them.\n“Ah! Telyánin! How d’ye do? They plucked me last night,” came Denísov’s\r\n      voice from the next room.\n“Where? At Bykov’s, at the rat’s... I knew it,” replied a piping voice,\r\n      and Lieutenant Telyánin, a small officer of the same squadron, entered the\r\n      room.\nRostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand\r\n      which was offered him. Telyánin for some reason had been transferred from\r\n      the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the regiment\r\n      but was not liked; Rostóv especially detested him and was unable to\r\n      overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.\n“Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?” he asked. (Rook was a\r\n      young horse Telyánin had sold to Rostóv.)\nThe lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the\r\n      face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.\n“I saw you riding this morning...” he added.\n“Oh, he’s all right, a good horse,” answered Rostóv, though the horse for\r\n      which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum. “He’s\r\n      begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,” he added.\n“The hoof’s cracked! That’s nothing. I’ll teach you what to do and show\r\n      you what kind of rivet to use.”\n“Yes, please do,” said Rostóv.\n“I’ll show you, I’ll show you! It’s not a secret. And it’s a horse you’ll\r\n      thank me for.”\n“Then I’ll have it brought round,” said Rostóv wishing to avoid Telyánin,\r\n      and he went out to give the order.\nIn the passage Denísov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold facing\r\n      the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing Rostóv, Denísov\r\n      screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the\r\n      room where Telyánin was sitting, he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust.\n“Ugh! I don’t like that fellow,” he said, regardless of the\r\n      quartermaster’s presence.\nRostóv shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: “Nor do I, but what’s one\r\n      to do?” and, having given his order, he returned to Telyánin.\nTelyánin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostóv had left\r\n      him, rubbing his small white hands.\n“Well there certainly are disgusting people,” thought Rostóv as he\r\n      entered.\n“Have you told them to bring the horse?” asked Telyánin, getting up and\r\n      looking carelessly about him.\n“I have.”\n“Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denísov about yesterday’s\r\n      order. Have you got it, Denísov?”\n“Not yet. But where are you off to?”\n“I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,” said Telyánin.\nThey went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant explained\r\n      how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.\nWhen Rostóv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the\r\n      table. Denísov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of\r\n      paper. He looked gloomily in Rostóv’s face and said: “I am witing to her.”\nHe leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and, evidently\r\n      glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write, told\r\n      Rostóv the contents of his letter.\n“You see, my fwiend,” he said, “we sleep when we don’t love. We are\r\n      childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one is\r\n      pua’ as on the fihst day of cweation... Who’s that now? Send him to the\r\n      devil, I’m busy!” he shouted to Lavrúshka, who went up to him not in the\r\n      least abashed.\n“Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It’s the quartermaster\r\n      for the money.”\nDenísov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.\n“Wetched business,” he muttered to himself. “How much is left in the\r\n      puhse?” he asked, turning to Rostóv.\n“Seven new and three old imperials.”\n“Oh, it’s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you sca’cwow?\r\n      Call the quahtehmasteh,” he shouted to Lavrúshka.\n“Please, Denísov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,” said\r\n      Rostóv, blushing.\n“Don’t like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don’t,” growled Denísov.\n“But if you won’t accept money from me like a comrade, you will offend me.\r\n      Really I have some,” Rostóv repeated.\n“No, I tell you.”\nAnd Denísov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.\n“Where have you put it, Wostóv?”\n“Under the lower pillow.”\n“It’s not there.”\nDenísov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.\n“That’s a miwacle.”\n“Wait, haven’t you dropped it?” said Rostóv, picking up the pillows one at\r\n      a time and shaking them.\nHe pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.\n“Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept it\r\n      under your head like a treasure,” said Rostóv. “I put it just here. Where\r\n      is it?” he asked, turning to Lavrúshka.\n“I haven’t been in the room. It must be where you put it.”\n“But it isn’t?...”\n“You’re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it.\r\n      Feel in your pockets.”\n“No, if I hadn’t thought of it being a treasure,” said Rostóv, “but I\r\n      remember putting it there.”\nLavrúshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under the\r\n      table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the room.\r\n      Denísov silently watched Lavrúshka’s movements, and when the latter threw\r\n      up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found Denísov glanced\r\n      at Rostóv.\n“Wostóv, you’ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...”\nRostóv felt Denísov’s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and instantly\r\n      dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere\r\n      below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not draw breath.\n“And there hasn’t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and\r\n      yourselves. It must be here somewhere,” said Lavrúshka.\n“Now then, you devil’s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!” shouted\r\n      Denísov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with a\r\n      threatening gesture. “If the purse isn’t found I’ll flog you, I’ll flog\r\n      you all.”\nRostóv, his eyes avoiding Denísov, began buttoning his coat, buckled on\r\n      his saber, and put on his cap.\n“I must have that purse, I tell you,” shouted Denísov, shaking his orderly\r\n      by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.\n“Denísov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,” said Rostóv, going\r\n      toward the door without raising his eyes. Denísov paused, thought a\r\n      moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostóv hinted at, seized his\r\n      arm.\n“Nonsense!” he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out\r\n      like cords. “You are mad, I tell you. I won’t allow it. The purse is here!\r\n      I’ll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found.”\n“I know who has taken it,” repeated Rostóv in an unsteady voice, and went\r\n      to the door.\n“And I tell you, don’t you dahe to do it!” shouted Denísov, rushing at the\r\n      cadet to restrain him.\nBut Rostóv pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though Denísov\r\n      were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face.\n“Do you understand what you’re saying?” he said in a trembling voice.\r\n      “There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it is not so,\r\n      then...”\nHe could not finish, and ran out of the room.\n“Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody,” were the last words Rostóv\r\n      heard.\nRostóv went to Telyánin’s quarters.\n“The master is not in, he’s gone to headquarters,” said Telyánin’s\r\n      orderly. “Has something happened?” he added, surprised at the cadet’s\r\n      troubled face.\n“No, nothing.”\n“You’ve only just missed him,” said the orderly.\nThe headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and Rostóv,\r\n      without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was an inn in\r\n      the village which the officers frequented. Rostóv rode up to it and saw\r\n      Telyánin’s horse at the porch.\nIn the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of\r\n      sausages and a bottle of wine.\n“Ah, you’ve come here too, young man!” he said, smiling and raising his\r\n      eyebrows.\n“Yes,” said Rostóv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word; and\r\n      he sat down at the nearest table.\nBoth were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the\r\n      room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives\r\n      and the munching of the lieutenant.\nWhen Telyánin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double\r\n      purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up\r\n      fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the\r\n      waiter.\n“Please be quick,” he said.\nThe coin was a new one. Rostóv rose and went up to Telyánin.\n“Allow me to look at your purse,” he said in a low, almost inaudible,\r\n      voice.\nWith shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyánin handed him the\r\n      purse.\n“Yes, it’s a nice purse. Yes, yes,” he said, growing suddenly pale, and\r\n      added, “Look at it, young man.”\nRostóv took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and\r\n      looked at Telyánin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and\r\n      suddenly seemed to grow very merry.\n“If we get to Vienna I’ll get rid of it there but in these wretched little\r\n      towns there’s nowhere to spend it,” said he. “Well, let me have it, young\r\n      man, I’m going.”\nRostóv did not speak.\n“And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite decently\r\n      here,” continued Telyánin. “Now then, let me have it.”\nHe stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostóv let go of it.\r\n      Telyánin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket\r\n      of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly\r\n      open, as if to say, “Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my pocket and\r\n      that’s quite simple and is no one else’s business.”\n“Well, young man?” he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted brows he\r\n      glanced into Rostóv’s eyes.\nSome flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyánin’s eyes to Rostóv’s\r\n      and back, and back again and again in an instant.\n“Come here,” said Rostóv, catching hold of Telyánin’s arm and almost\r\n      dragging him to the window. “That money is Denísov’s; you took it...” he\r\n      whispered just above Telyánin’s ear.\n“What? What? How dare you? What?” said Telyánin.\nBut these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for\r\n      pardon. As soon as Rostóv heard them, an enormous load of doubt fell from\r\n      him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man\r\n      who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be completed.\n“Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,” muttered Telyánin,\r\n      taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. “We must have an\r\n      explanation...”\n“I know it and shall prove it,” said Rostóv.\n“I...”\nEvery muscle of Telyánin’s pale, terrified face began to quiver, his eyes\r\n      still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to\r\n      Rostóv’s face, and his sobs were audible.\n“Count!... Don’t ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money, take\r\n      it...” He threw it on the table. “I have an old father and mother!...”\nRostóv took the money, avoiding Telyánin’s eyes, and went out of the room\r\n      without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps. “O\r\n      God,” he said with tears in his eyes, “how could you do it?”\n“Count...” said Telyánin drawing nearer to him.\n“Don’t touch me,” said Rostóv, drawing back. “If you need it, take the\r\n      money,” and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn."

    "text": "That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron’s\r\n      officers in Denísov’s quarters.\n“And I tell you, Rostóv, that you must apologize to the colonel!” said a\r\n      tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and many\r\n      wrinkles on his large features, to Rostóv who was crimson with excitement.\nThe staff captain, Kírsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for\r\n      affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.\n“I will allow no one to call me a liar!” cried Rostóv. “He told me I lied,\r\n      and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me on duty every\r\n      day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me apologize,\r\n      because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it beneath his\r\n      dignity to give me satisfaction, then...”\n“You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,” interrupted the\r\n      staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache. “You\r\n      tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has\r\n      stolen...”\n“I’m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other\r\n      officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am not a\r\n      diplomatist. That’s why I joined the hussars, thinking that here one would\r\n      not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying—so let him give me\r\n      satisfaction...”\n“That’s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that’s not the point.\r\n      Ask Denísov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand\r\n      satisfaction of his regimental commander?”\nDenísov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the\r\n      conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the\r\n      staff captain’s question by a disapproving shake of his head.\n“You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other\r\n      officers,” continued the staff captain, “and Bogdánich” (the colonel was\r\n      called Bogdánich) “shuts you up.”\n“He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.”\n“Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must\r\n      apologize.”\n“Not on any account!” exclaimed Rostóv.\n“I did not expect this of you,” said the staff captain seriously and\r\n      severely. “You don’t wish to apologize, but, man, it’s not only to him but\r\n      to the whole regiment—all of us—you’re to blame all round. The\r\n      case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice;\r\n      but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers. Now what\r\n      was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole\r\n      regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that\r\n      how you look at it? We don’t see it like that. And Bogdánich was a brick:\r\n      he told you you were saying what was not true. It’s not pleasant, but\r\n      what’s to be done, my dear fellow? You landed yourself in it. And now,\r\n      when one wants to smooth the thing over, some conceit prevents your\r\n      apologizing, and you wish to make the whole affair public. You are\r\n      offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not apologize to an old and\r\n      honorable officer? Whatever Bogdánich may be, anyway he is an honorable\r\n      and brave old colonel! You’re quick at taking offense, but you don’t mind\r\n      disgracing the whole regiment!” The staff captain’s voice began to\r\n      tremble. “You have been in the regiment next to no time, my lad, you’re\r\n      here today and tomorrow you’ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can\r\n      snap your fingers when it is said ‘There are thieves among the Pávlograd\r\n      officers!’ But it’s not all the same to us! Am I not right, Denísov? It’s\r\n      not the same!”\nDenísov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with his\r\n      glittering black eyes at Rostóv.\n“You value your own pride and don’t wish to apologize,” continued the\r\n      staff captain, “but we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God willing,\r\n      are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the regiment, and\r\n      Bogdánich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And all this is not\r\n      right, it’s not right! You may take offense or not but I always stick to\r\n      mother truth. It’s not right!”\nAnd the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostóv.\n“That’s twue, devil take it!” shouted Denísov, jumping up. “Now then,\r\n      Wostóv, now then!”\nRostóv, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one\r\n      officer and then at the other.\n“No, gentlemen, no... you mustn’t think... I quite understand. You’re\r\n      wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of the regiment\r\n      I’d... Ah well, I’ll show that in action, and for me the honor of the\r\n      flag... Well, never mind, it’s true I’m to blame, to blame all round.\r\n      Well, what else do you want?...”\n“Come, that’s right, Count!” cried the staff captain, turning round and\r\n      clapping Rostóv on the shoulder with his big hand.\n“I tell you,” shouted Denísov, “he’s a fine fellow.”\n“That’s better, Count,” said the staff captain, beginning to address\r\n      Rostóv by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. “Go and\r\n      apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!”\n“Gentlemen, I’ll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,” said\r\n      Rostóv in an imploring voice, “but I can’t apologize, by God I can’t, do\r\n      what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking\r\n      forgiveness?”\nDenísov began to laugh.\n“It’ll be worse for you. Bogdánich is vindictive and you’ll pay for your\r\n      obstinacy,” said Kírsten.\n“No, on my word it’s not obstinacy! I can’t describe the feeling. I\r\n      can’t...”\n“Well, it’s as you like,” said the staff captain. “And what has become of\r\n      that scoundrel?” he asked Denísov.\n“He has weported himself sick, he’s to be stwuck off the list tomowwow,”\r\n       muttered Denísov.\n“It is an illness, there’s no other way of explaining it,” said the staff\r\n      captain.\n“Illness or not, he’d better not cwoss my path. I’d kill him!” shouted\r\n      Denísov in a bloodthirsty tone.\nJust then Zherkóv entered the room.\n“What brings you here?” cried the officers turning to the newcomer.\n“We’re to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his whole\r\n      army.”\n“It’s not true!”\n“I’ve seen him myself!”\n“What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?”\n“Into action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how did\r\n      you come here?”\n“I’ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil, Mack.\r\n      An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on Mack’s\r\n      arrival... What’s the matter, Rostóv? You look as if you’d just come out\r\n      of a hot bath.”\n“Oh, my dear fellow, we’re in such a stew here these last two days.”\nThe regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by Zherkóv.\r\n      They were under orders to advance next day.\n“We’re going into action, gentlemen!”\n“Well, thank God! We’ve been sitting here too long!”"

    "text": "Kutúzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over\r\n      the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October 23 the\r\n      Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian baggage\r\n      train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling through the town\r\n      of Enns on both sides of the bridge.\nIt was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out\r\n      before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the\r\n      bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and\r\n      then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could be\r\n      clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below, the\r\n      little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its\r\n      cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses\r\n      of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a\r\n      castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns\r\n      and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube\r\n      covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green treetops and\r\n      bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin\r\n      pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy’s horse\r\n      patrols could be discerned.\nAmong the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the\r\n      rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through his\r\n      fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvítski, who had been sent to the\r\n      rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a gun\r\n      carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a\r\n      flask, and Nesvítski was treating some officers to pies and realdoppelkümmel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their knees,\r\n      some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.\n“Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It’s a fine\r\n      place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?” Nesvítski was saying.\n“Thank you very much, Prince,” answered one of the officers, pleased to be\r\n      talking to a staff officer of such importance. “It’s a lovely place! We\r\n      passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a splendid house!”\n“Look, Prince,” said another, who would have dearly liked to take another\r\n      pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside—“See,\r\n      our infantrymen have already got there. Look there in the meadow behind\r\n      the village, three of them are dragging something. They’ll ransack that\r\n      castle,” he remarked with evident approval.\n“So they will,” said Nesvítski. “No, but what I should like,” added he,\r\n      munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, “would be to slip in\r\n      over there.”\nHe pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and\r\n      gleamed.\n“That would be fine, gentlemen!”\nThe officers laughed.\n“Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls among\r\n      them. On my word I’d give five years of my life for it!”\n“They must be feeling dull, too,” said one of the bolder officers,\r\n      laughing.\nMeanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the\r\n      general, who looked through his field glass.\n“Yes, so it is, so it is,” said the general angrily, lowering the field\r\n      glass and shrugging his shoulders, “so it is! They’ll be fired on at the\r\n      crossing. And why are they dawdling there?”\nOn the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from\r\n      their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of a\r\n      shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.\nNesvítski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.\n“Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?” he said.\n“It’s a bad business,” said the general without answering him, “our men\r\n      have been wasting time.”\n“Hadn’t I better ride over, your excellency?” asked Nesvítski.\n“Yes, please do,” answered the general, and he repeated the order that had\r\n      already once been given in detail: “and tell the hussars that they are to\r\n      cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the inflammable\r\n      material on the bridge must be reinspected.”\n“Very good,” answered Nesvítski.\nHe called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack\r\n      and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.\n“I’ll really call in on the nuns,” he said to the officers who watched him\r\n      smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the hill.\n“Now then, let’s see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!” said the\r\n      general, turning to an artillery officer. “Have a little fun to pass the\r\n      time.”\n“Crew, to your guns!” commanded the officer.\nIn a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began\r\n      loading.\n“One!” came the command.\nNumber one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening\r\n      metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops\r\n      below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke showing the\r\n      spot where it burst.\nThe faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got up\r\n      and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly visible\r\n      as if but a stone’s throw away, and the movements of the approaching enemy\r\n      farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the\r\n      clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the\r\n      bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER VII",
    "text": "Two of the enemy’s shots had already flown across the bridge, where there\r\n      was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesvítski, who had alighted from\r\n      his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings. He looked\r\n      back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two\r\n      horses by their bridles. Each time Prince Nesvítski tried to move on,\r\n      soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the\r\n      railings, and all he could do was to smile.\n“What a fine fellow you are, friend!” said the Cossack to a convoy soldier\r\n      with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded\r\n      together close to his wheels and his horses. “What a fellow! You can’t\r\n      wait a moment! Don’t you see the general wants to pass?”\nBut the convoyman took no notice of the word “general” and shouted at the\r\n      soldiers who were blocking his way. “Hi there, boys! Keep to the left!\r\n      Wait a bit.” But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to shoulder,\r\n      their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense mass.\r\n      Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvítski saw the rapid, noisy little\r\n      waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of the\r\n      bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally\r\n      uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos,\r\n      knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad\r\n      cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and feet that\r\n      moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge.\r\n      Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam\r\n      on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face\r\n      different from that of the men, squeezed his way along; sometimes like a\r\n      chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot, an orderly, or a\r\n      townsman was carried through the waves of infantry; and sometimes like a\r\n      log floating down the river, an officers’ or company’s baggage wagon,\r\n      piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides, moved across the\r\n      bridge.\n“It’s as if a dam had burst,” said the Cossack hopelessly. “Are there many\r\n      more of you to come?”\n“A million all but one!” replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat, with a\r\n      wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.\n“Ifhe” (hemeant the enemy) “begins popping at the bridge now,” said the\r\n      old soldier dismally to a comrade, “you’ll forget to scratch yourself.”\nThat soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.\n“Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?” said an orderly,\r\n      running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.\nAnd he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who\r\n      had evidently been drinking.\n“And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of\r\n      his gun...” a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily, with\r\n      a wide swing of his arm.\n“Yes, the ham was just delicious...” answered another with a loud laugh.\r\n      And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvítski did not learn who had been\r\n      struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.\n“Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they’ll all be\r\n      killed,” a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.\n“As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,” said a young soldier with\r\n      an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, “I felt like dying of\r\n      fright. I did, ‘pon my word, I got that frightened!” said he, as if\r\n      bragging of having been frightened.\nThat one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone\r\n      before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and\r\n      seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with a\r\n      large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned\r\n      baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were\r\n      sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were allowed to\r\n      pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the\r\n      women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers’\r\n      remarks related to the two young ones. Every face bore almost the same\r\n      smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the women.\n“Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!”\n“Sell me the missis,” said another soldier, addressing the German, who,\r\n      angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast eyes.\n“See how smart she’s made herself! Oh, the devils!”\n“There, Fedótov, you should be quartered on them!”\n“I have seen as much before now, mate!”\n“Where are you going?” asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple,\r\n      also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.\nThe German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.\n“Take it if you like,” said the officer, giving the girl an apple.\nThe girl smiled and took it. Nesvítski like the rest of the men on the\r\n      bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When they\r\n      had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same kind of\r\n      talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of a convoy\r\n      wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole crowd had to\r\n      wait.\n“And why are they stopping? There’s no proper order!” said the soldiers.\r\n      “Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can’t you wait? It’ll be worse\r\n      if he fires the bridge. See, here’s an officer jammed in too”—different\r\n      voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked at one another, and all\r\n      pressed toward the exit from the bridge.\nLooking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesvítski\r\n      suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...\r\n      something big, that splashed into the water.\n“Just see where it carries to!” a soldier near by said sternly, looking\r\n      round at the sound.\n“Encouraging us to get along quicker,” said another uneasily.\nThe crowd moved on again. Nesvítski realized that it was a cannon ball.\n“Hey, Cossack, my horse!” he said. “Now, then, you there! get out of the\r\n      way! Make way!”\nWith great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting\r\n      continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for\r\n      him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those\r\n      nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still\r\n      harder from behind.\n“Nesvítski, Nesvítski! you numskull!” came a hoarse voice from behind him.\nNesvítski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated by\r\n      the living mass of moving infantry, Váska Denísov, red and shaggy, with\r\n      his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over\r\n      his shoulder.\n“Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!” shouted Denísov\r\n      evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot\r\n      whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small\r\n      bare hand as red as his face.\n“Ah, Váska!” joyfully replied Nesvítski. “What’s up with you?”\n“The squadwon can’t pass,” shouted Váska Denísov, showing his white teeth\r\n      fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which twitched its ears\r\n      as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting white foam from his bit,\r\n      tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs, and apparently ready to\r\n      jump over the railings had his rider let him. “What is this? They’re like\r\n      sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you\r\n      devil with the cart! I’ll hack you with my saber!” he shouted, actually\r\n      drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it.\nThe soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and Denísov\r\n      joined Nesvítski.\n“How’s it you’re not drunk today?” said Nesvítski when the other had\r\n      ridden up to him.\n“They don’t even give one time to dwink!” answered Váska Denísov. “They\r\n      keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they mean to fight,\r\n      let’s fight. But the devil knows what this is.”\n“What a dandy you are today!” said Nesvítski, looking at Denísov’s new\r\n      cloak and saddlecloth.\nDenísov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a\r\n      smell of perfume, and put it to Nesvítski’s nose.\n“Of course. I’m going into action! I’ve shaved, bwushed my teeth, and\r\n      scented myself.”\nThe imposing figure of Nesvítski followed by his Cossack, and the\r\n      determination of Denísov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically,\r\n      had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther\r\n      side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the bridge Nesvítski\r\n      found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order, and having done\r\n      this he rode back.\nHaving cleared the way Denísov stopped at the end of the bridge.\r\n      Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the\r\n      ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw nearer.\r\n      Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping, resounded on the\r\n      planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in front and men four\r\n      abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it.\nThe infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled\r\n      mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will, estrangement, and\r\n      ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another\r\n      at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in regular order.\n“Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!” said one.\n“What good are they? They’re led about just for show!” remarked another.\n“Don’t kick up the dust, you infantry!” jested an hussar whose prancing\r\n      horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.\n“I’d like to put you on a two days’ march with a knapsack! Your fine cords\r\n      would soon get a bit rubbed,” said an infantryman, wiping the mud off his\r\n      face with his sleeve. “Perched up there, you’re more like a bird than a\r\n      man.”\n“There now, Zíkin, they ought to put you on a horse. You’d look fine,”\r\n       said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight\r\n      of his knapsack.\n“Take a stick between your legs, that’ll suit you for a horse!” the hussar\r\n      shouted back."

    "text": "The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing together\r\n      as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last the baggage\r\n      wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last battalion came\r\n      onto the bridge. Only Denísov’s squadron of hussars remained on the\r\n      farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could be seen from the\r\n      hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge, for the\r\n      horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed\r\n      by the rising ground only half a mile away. At the foot of the hill lay\r\n      wasteland over which a few groups of our Cossack scouts were moving.\r\n      Suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground, artillery and troops\r\n      in blue uniform were seen. These were the French. A group of Cossack\r\n      scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All the officers and men of\r\n      Denísov’s squadron, though they tried to talk of other things and to look\r\n      in other directions, thought only of what was there on the hilltop, and\r\n      kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline, which\r\n      they knew to be the enemy’s troops. The weather had cleared again since\r\n      noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the Danube and the dark\r\n      hills around it. It was calm, and at intervals the bugle calls and the\r\n      shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill. There was no one now\r\n      between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers. An\r\n      empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them. The\r\n      enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, and\r\n      intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more\r\n      clearly felt.\n“One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the\r\n      living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And what is\r\n      there? Who is there?—there beyond that field, that tree, that roof\r\n      lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear and yet\r\n      long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must be crossed\r\n      and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will inevitably\r\n      have to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are strong,\r\n      healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such excitedly\r\n      animated and healthy men.” So thinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who\r\n      comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives a particular glamour\r\n      and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such\r\n      moments.\nOn the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose, and a\r\n      ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The officers\r\n      who had been standing together rode off to their places. The hussars began\r\n      carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole squadron. All\r\n      were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander, awaiting\r\n      the word of command. A second and a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently\r\n      they were firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle\r\n      flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The\r\n      hussars did not look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word\r\n      of command, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so\r\n      different, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the\r\n      stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers without turning their heads\r\n      glanced at one another, curious to see their comrades’ impression. Every\r\n      face, from Denísov’s to that of the bugler, showed one common expression\r\n      of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around chin and mouth. The\r\n      quartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish\r\n      them. Cadet Mirónov ducked every time a ball flew past. Rostóv on the left\r\n      flank, mounted on his Rook—a handsome horse despite its game leg—had\r\n      the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an\r\n      examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was\r\n      glancing at everyone with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to\r\n      notice how calmly he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too\r\n      that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.\n“Who’s that curtseying there? Cadet Miwónov! That’s not wight! Look at\r\n      me,” cried Denísov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept turning his\r\n      horse in front of the squadron.\nThe black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Váska Denísov, and his whole short\r\n      sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he\r\n      held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did,\r\n      especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he was\r\n      only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when\r\n      they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good\r\n      horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle, he\r\n      galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice\r\n      to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to Kírsten. The staff\r\n      captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a walk to meet him. His\r\n      face with its long mustache was serious as always, only his eyes were\r\n      brighter than usual.\n“Well, what about it?” said he to Denísov. “It won’t come to a fight.\r\n      You’ll see—we shall retire.”\n“The devil only knows what they’re about!” muttered Denísov. “Ah, Wostóv,”\r\n       he cried noticing the cadet’s bright face, “you’ve got it at last.”\nAnd he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. Rostóv felt\r\n      perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge. Denísov\r\n      galloped up to him.\n“Your excellency! Let us attack them! I’ll dwive them off.”\n“Attack indeed!” said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his face\r\n      as if driving off a troublesome fly. “And why are you stopping here? Don’t\r\n      you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron back.”\nThe squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without\r\n      having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front\r\n      line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side\r\n      of the river.\nThe two Pávlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the\r\n      hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdánich Schubert, came up\r\n      to Denísov’s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostóv, without\r\n      taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time\r\n      since their encounter concerning Telyánin. Rostóv, feeling that he was at\r\n      the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he\r\n      had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel’s athletic back,\r\n      his nape covered with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rostóv\r\n      that Bogdánich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole\r\n      aim now was to test the cadet’s courage, so he drew himself up and looked\r\n      around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdánich rode so near in\r\n      order to show him his courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send\r\n      the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him—Rostóv. Then\r\n      he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdánich would come up to him as he\r\n      lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.\nThe high-shouldered figure of Zherkóv, familiar to the Pávlograds as he\r\n      had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. After his\r\n      dismissal from headquarters Zherkóv had not remained in the regiment,\r\n      saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get\r\n      more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded in attaching\r\n      himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagratión. He now came to his\r\n      former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard.\n“Colonel,” he said, addressing Rostóv’s enemy with an air of gloomy\r\n      gravity and glancing round at his comrades, “there is an order to stop and\r\n      fire the bridge.”\n“An order to who?” asked the colonel morosely.\n“I don’t myself know ‘to who,’” replied the cornet in a serious tone, “but\r\n      the prince told me to ‘go and tell the colonel that the hussars must\r\n      return quickly and fire the bridge.’”\nZherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel\r\n      of hussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesvítski came\r\n      galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight.\n“How’s this, Colonel?” he shouted as he approached. “I told you to fire\r\n      the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all beside\r\n      themselves over there and one can’t make anything out.”\nThe colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvítski.\n“You spoke to me of inflammable material,” said he, “but you said nothing\r\n      about firing it.”\n“But, my dear sir,” said Nesvítski as he drew up, taking off his cap and\r\n      smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand, “wasn’t I\r\n      telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material had been put in\r\n      position?”\n“I am not your ‘dear sir,’ Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to\r\n      burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders strictly to\r\n      obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would burn it, I could\r\n      not know by the holy spirit!”\n“Ah, that’s always the way!” said Nesvítski with a wave of the hand. “How\r\n      did you get here?” said he, turning to Zherkóv.\n“On the same business. But youaredamp! Let me wring you out!”\n“You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...” continued the colonel in an\r\n      offended tone.\n“Colonel,” interrupted the officer of the suite, “You must be quick or the\r\n      enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.”\nThe colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout\r\n      staff officer, and at Zherkóv, and he frowned.\n“I will the bridge fire,” he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that\r\n      in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the\r\n      right thing.\nStriking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for\r\n      everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron,\r\n      that in which Rostóv was serving under Denísov, to return to the bridge.\n“There, it’s just as I thought,” said Rostóv to himself. “He wishes to\r\n      test me!” His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. “Let him\r\n      see whether I am a coward!” he thought.\nAgain on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression\r\n      appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostóv watched his enemy, the\r\n      colonel, closely—to find in his face confirmation of his own\r\n      conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostóv, and looked as\r\n      he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word of\r\n      command.\n“Look sharp! Look sharp!” several voices repeated around him.\nTheir sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the hussars\r\n      hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men were\r\n      crossing themselves. Rostóv no longer looked at the colonel, he had no\r\n      time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid that his\r\n      heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an\r\n      orderly’s charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud.\r\n      Denísov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something. Rostóv saw\r\n      nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs catching and\r\n      their sabers clattering.\n“Stretchers!” shouted someone behind him.\nRostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,\r\n      trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not looking\r\n      at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled, and fell on\r\n      his hands. The others outstripped him.\n“At boss zides, Captain,” he heard the voice of the colonel, who, having\r\n      ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a triumphant,\r\n      cheerful face.\nRostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was\r\n      about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front the\r\n      better. But Bogdánich, without looking at or recognizing Rostóv, shouted\r\n      to him:\n“Who’s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come back,\r\n      Cadet!” he cried angrily; and turning to Denísov, who, showing off his\r\n      courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:\n“Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,” he said.\n“Oh, every bullet has its billet,” answered Váska Denísov, turning in his\r\n      saddle.\n\nMeanwhile Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer of the suite were standing\r\n      together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of men\r\n      with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord, and blue riding\r\n      breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was\r\n      approaching in the distance from the opposite side—the blue uniforms\r\n      and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.\n“Will they burn the bridge or not? Who’ll get there first? Will they get\r\n      there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range\r\n      and wipe them out?” These were the questions each man of the troops on the\r\n      high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking\r\n      heart—watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening\r\n      light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their\r\n      bayonets and guns.\n“Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!” said Nesvítski; “they are within\r\n      grapeshot range now.”\n“He shouldn’t have taken so many men,” said the officer of the suite.\n“True enough,” answered Nesvítski; “two smart fellows could have done the\r\n      job just as well.”\n“Ah, your excellency,” put in Zherkóv, his eyes fixed on the hussars, but\r\n      still with that naïve air that made it impossible to know whether he was\r\n      speaking in jest or in earnest. “Ah, your excellency! How you look at\r\n      things! Send two men? And who then would give us the Vladímir medal and\r\n      ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the squadron may be\r\n      recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our Bogdánich knows how\r\n      things are done.”\n“There now!” said the officer of the suite, “that’s grapeshot.”\nHe pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached\r\n      and hurriedly removed.\nOn the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke\r\n      appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the\r\n      moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two reports\r\n      one after another, and a third.\n“Oh! Oh!” groaned Nesvítski as if in fierce pain, seizing the officer of\r\n      the suite by the arm. “Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!”\n“Two, I think.”\n“If I were Tsar I would never go to war,” said Nesvítski, turning away.\nThe French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue uniforms\r\n      advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again but at irregular\r\n      intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge. But this\r\n      time Nesvítski could not see what was happening there, as a dense cloud of\r\n      smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and\r\n      the French batteries were now firing at them, no longer to hinder them but\r\n      because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at.\nThe French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars\r\n      got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too high,\r\n      but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked\r\n      three of them over.\nRostóv, absorbed by his relations with Bogdánich, had paused on the bridge\r\n      not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he had always\r\n      imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the bridge because\r\n      he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers. He\r\n      stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as\r\n      if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest to him fell against the\r\n      rails with a groan. Rostóv ran up to him with the others. Again someone\r\n      shouted, “Stretchers!” Four men seized the hussar and began lifting him.\n“Oooh! For Christ’s sake let me alone!” cried the wounded man, but still\r\n      he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.\nNicholas Rostóv turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed into\r\n      the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the sun. How\r\n      beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep! How bright and\r\n      glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the waters of the\r\n      distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway blue mountains\r\n      beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests\r\n      veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace and happiness... “I\r\n      should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I were there,” thought\r\n      Rostóv. “In myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness;\r\n      but here... groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry...\r\n      There—they are shouting again, and again are all running back\r\n      somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, is here above me and\r\n      around... Another instant and I shall never again see the sun, this water,\r\n      that gorge!...”\nAt that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other\r\n      stretchers came into view before Rostóv. And the fear of death and of the\r\n      stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one feeling\r\n      of sickening agitation.\n“O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect me!”\r\n       Rostóv whispered.\nThe hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices\r\n      sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.\n“Well, fwiend? So you’ve smelt powdah!” shouted Váska Denísov just above\r\n      his ear.\n“It’s all over; but I am a coward—yes, a coward!” thought Rostóv,\r\n      and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one foot,\r\n      from the orderly and began to mount.\n“Was that grapeshot?” he asked Denísov.\n“Yes and no mistake!” cried Denísov. “You worked like wegular bwicks and\r\n      it’s nasty work! An attack’s pleasant work! Hacking away at the dogs! But\r\n      this sort of thing is the very devil, with them shooting at you like a\r\n      target.”\nAnd Denísov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostóv, composed of\r\n      the colonel, Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer from the suite.\n“Well, it seems that no one has noticed,” thought Rostóv. And this was\r\n      true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation which\r\n      the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.\n“Here’s something for you to report,” said Zherkóv. “See if I don’t get\r\n      promoted to a sublieutenancy.”\n“Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!” said the colonel triumphantly\r\n      and gaily.\n“And if he asks about the losses?”\n“A trifle,” said the colonel in his bass voice: “two hussars wounded, and\r\n      one knocked out,” he added, unable to restrain a happy smile, and\r\n      pronouncing the phrase “knocked out” with ringing distinctness."

    "text": "Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of\r\n      Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it, losing\r\n      confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, and\r\n      compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been\r\n      foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded by\r\n      Kutúzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where\r\n      overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as\r\n      necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment.\r\n      There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the\r\n      courage and endurance—acknowledged even by the enemy—with\r\n      which the Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet\r\n      more rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and\r\n      had joined Kutúzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and\r\n      Kutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The defense\r\n      of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an offensive, the\r\n      plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of\r\n      strategics, had been handed to Kutúzov when he was in Vienna by the\r\n      Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for\r\n      him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from\r\n      Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.\nOn the twenty-eighth of October Kutúzov with his army crossed to the left\r\n      bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with the\r\n      river between himself and the main body of the French. On the thirtieth he\r\n      attacked Mortier’s division, which was on the left bank, and broke it up.\r\n      In this action for the first time trophies were taken: banners, cannon,\r\n      and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a fortnight’s retreat,\r\n      the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the\r\n      field but had repulsed the French. Though the troops were ill-clad,\r\n      exhausted, and had lost a third of their number in killed, wounded, sick,\r\n      and stragglers; though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on\r\n      the other side of the Danube with a letter in which Kutúzov entrusted them\r\n      to the humanity of the enemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses\r\n      in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all\r\n      the sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over\r\n      Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably. Throughout the whole\r\n      army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of\r\n      the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by\r\n      the Austrians, and of the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.\nPrince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian\r\n      General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been wounded\r\n      under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark of the\r\n      commander in chief’s special favor he was sent with the news of this\r\n      victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was\r\n      threatened by the French) but at Brünn. Despite his apparently delicate\r\n      build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many\r\n      very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems\r\n      excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhtúrov to Kutúzov, he was\r\n      sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brünn. To be so sent meant not\r\n      only a reward but an important step toward promotion.\nThe night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that had\r\n      fallen the previous day—the day of the battle. Reviewing his\r\n      impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the\r\n      impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off\r\n      given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince Andrew\r\n      was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who\r\n      has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon as he\r\n      closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and\r\n      the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that the Russians were\r\n      running away and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself\r\n      with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this was not so but that\r\n      on the contrary the French had run away. He again recalled all the details\r\n      of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle, and feeling\r\n      reassured he dozed off.... The dark starry night was followed by a bright\r\n      cheerful morning. The snow was thawing in the sunshine, the horses\r\n      galloped quickly, and on both sides of the road were forests of different\r\n      kinds, fields, and villages.\nAt one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded. The\r\n      Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart,\r\n      shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of the long\r\n      German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being jolted over\r\n      the stony road. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian words), others\r\n      were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked silently, with the\r\n      languid interest of sick children, at the envoy hurrying past them.\nPrince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what action\r\n      they had been wounded. “Day before yesterday, on the Danube,” answered the\r\n      soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold\r\n      pieces.\n“That’s for them all,” he said to the officer who came up.\n“Get well soon, lads!” he continued, turning to the soldiers. “There’s\r\n      plenty to do still.”\n“What news, sir?” asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a\r\n      conversation.\n“Good news!... Go on!” he shouted to the driver, and they galloped on.\nIt was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved\r\n      streets of Brünn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the\r\n      lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that\r\n      atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a\r\n      soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night,\r\n      Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and\r\n      alert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly\r\n      and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and\r\n      rapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer\r\n      dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself\r\n      stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual\r\n      questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give. He\r\n      expected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance to\r\n      the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and\r\n      learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.\n“To the right from the corridor,Euer Hochgeboren!There you will find the\r\n      adjutant on duty,” said the official. “He will conduct you to the Minister\r\n      of War.”\nThe adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went\r\n      in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing with\r\n      particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a corridor to\r\n      the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The adjutant by his\r\n      elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity\r\n      on the part of the Russian messenger.\nPrince Andrew’s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached\r\n      the door of the minister’s room. He felt offended, and without his\r\n      noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain\r\n      which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly suggested to him\r\n      a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the\r\n      minister. “Away from the smell of powder, they probably think it easy to\r\n      gain victories!” he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered\r\n      the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps. This\r\n      feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a\r\n      large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for\r\n      the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival. A wax\r\n      candle stood at each side of the minister’s bent bald head with its gray\r\n      temples. He went on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the\r\n      opening of the door and the sound of footsteps.\n“Take this and deliver it,” said he to his adjutant, handing him the\r\n      papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.\nPrince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutúzov’s army interested\r\n      the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned\r\n      with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that impression.\r\n      “But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,” he thought. The\r\n      minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them evenly, and\r\n      then raised his head. He had an intellectual and distinctive head, but the\r\n      instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his\r\n      face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him. His face\r\n      took on the stupid artificial smile (which does not even attempt to hide\r\n      its artificiality) of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners\r\n      one after another.\n“From General Field Marshal Kutúzov?” he asked. “I hope it is good news?\r\n      There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was high time!”\nHe took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with\r\n      a mournful expression.\n“Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!” he exclaimed in German. “What a calamity!\r\n      What a calamity!”\nHaving glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at\r\n      Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.\n“Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is not\r\n      captured.” Again he pondered. “I am very glad you have brought good news,\r\n      though Schmidt’s death is a heavy price to pay for the victory. His\r\n      Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank you! You\r\n      must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade. However, I\r\n      will let you know.”\nThe stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,\r\n      reappeared.\n“Au revoir!Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to see\r\n      you,” he added, bowing his head.\nWhen Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and\r\n      happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the\r\n      indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The\r\n      whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed the\r\n      memory of a remote event long past."

    "text": "Prince Andrew stayed at Brünn with Bilíbin, a Russian acquaintance of his\r\n      in the diplomatic service.\n“Ah, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,” said\r\n      Bilíbin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. “Franz, put the prince’s\r\n      things in my bedroom,” said he to the servant who was ushering Bolkónski\r\n      in. “So you’re a messenger of victory, eh? Splendid! And I am sitting here\r\n      ill, as you see.”\nAfter washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat’s\r\n      luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bilíbin\r\n      settled down comfortably beside the fire.\nAfter his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of\r\n      all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince\r\n      Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such\r\n      as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant,\r\n      after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian (for they\r\n      were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he supposed,\r\n      share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was then\r\n      particularly strong.\nBilíbin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as\r\n      Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but had\r\n      become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutúzov. Just\r\n      as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the\r\n      military profession, so to an even greater extent Bilíbin gave promise of\r\n      rising in his diplomatic career. He was still a young man but no longer a\r\n      young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen, had\r\n      been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather important post in\r\n      Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him\r\n      and valued him. He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed\r\n      because they have certain negative qualities, avoid doing certain things,\r\n      and speak French. He was one of those, who, liking work, knew how to do\r\n      it, and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his\r\n      writing table. He worked well whatever the import of his work. It was not\r\n      the question “What for?” but the question “How?” that interested him. What\r\n      the diplomatic matter might be he did not care, but it gave him great\r\n      pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully,\r\n      pointedly, and elegantly. Bilíbin’s services were valued not only for what\r\n      he wrote, but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in\r\n      the highest spheres.\nBilíbin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be made\r\n      elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say\r\n      something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was\r\n      possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,\r\n      finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the\r\n      inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so\r\n      that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to\r\n      drawing room. And, in fact, Bilíbin’s witticisms were hawked about in the\r\n      Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered\r\n      important.\nHis thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always\r\n      looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one’s fingers after a\r\n      Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of\r\n      expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and\r\n      his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and deep\r\n      wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always twinkled\r\n      and looked out straight.\n“Well, now tell me about your exploits,” said he.\nBolkónski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the\r\n      engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.\n“They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of\r\n      skittles,” said he in conclusion.\nBilíbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.\n“Cependant, mon cher,”he remarked, examining his nails from a\r\n      distance and puckering the skin above his left eye,“malgré la haute\r\n      estime que je professe pourthe Orthodox Russian army,j’avoue que\r\n      votre victoire n’est pas des plus victorieuses.”*\n* “But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox\r\n     Russian army, I must say that your victory was not\r\n     particularly victorious.”\nHe went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in\r\n      Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.\n“Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and\r\n      his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers!\r\n      Where’s the victory?”\n“But seriously,” said Prince Andrew, “we can at any rate say without\r\n      boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...”\n“Why didn’t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?”\n“Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a\r\n      parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by seven in\r\n      the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon.”\n“And why didn’t you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have been\r\n      there at seven in the morning,” returned Bilíbin with a smile. “You ought\r\n      to have been there at seven in the morning.”\n“Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods\r\n      that he had better leave Genoa alone?” retorted Prince Andrew in the same\r\n      tone.\n“I know,” interrupted Bilíbin, “you’re thinking it’s very easy to take\r\n      marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but still why\r\n      didn’t you capture him? So don’t be surprised if not only the Minister of\r\n      War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is not\r\n      much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor secretary of the Russian\r\n      Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my Franz a\r\n      thaler, or let him go with hisLiebchento the Prater... True, we have no\r\n      Prater here...”\nHe looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead.\n“It is now my turn to ask you ‘why?’mon cher,” said Bolkónski. “I confess\r\n      I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond\r\n      my feeble intelligence, but I can’t make it out. Mack loses a whole army,\r\n      the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs of life and\r\n      make blunder after blunder. Kutúzov alone at last gains a real victory,\r\n      destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French, and the Minister\r\n      of War does not even care to hear the details.”\n“That’s just it, my dear fellow. You see it’shurrahfor the Tsar, for\r\n      Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what do\r\n      we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us nice news\r\n      of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke’s as good as\r\n      another, as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of\r\n      Bonaparte’s, that will be another story and we’ll fire off some cannon!\r\n      But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl\r\n      does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon\r\n      Vienna, give up its defense—as much as to say: ‘Heaven is with us,\r\n      but heaven help you and your capital!’ The one general whom we all loved,\r\n      Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the\r\n      victory! Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been\r\n      conceived. It’s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides,\r\n      suppose you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained\r\n      a victory, what effect would that have on the general course of events?\r\n      It’s too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!”\n“What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?”\n“Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schönbrunn, and the count, our\r\n      dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.”\nAfter the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and\r\n      especially after having dined, Bolkónski felt that he could not take in\r\n      the full significance of the words he heard.\n“Count Lichtenfels was here this morning,” Bilíbin continued, “and showed\r\n      me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully\r\n      described: Prince Muratet tout le tremblement... You see that your\r\n      victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can’t be received\r\n      as a savior.”\n“Really I don’t care about that, I don’t care at all,” said Prince Andrew,\r\n      beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was\r\n      really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of Austria’s\r\n      capital. “How is it Vienna was taken? What of the bridge and its\r\n      celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard reports that Prince\r\n      Auersperg was defending Vienna?” he said.\n“Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is defending\r\n      us—doing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending us. But\r\n      Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I\r\n      hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it\r\n      up. Otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of Bohemia,\r\n      and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between\r\n      two fires.”\n“But still this does not mean that the campaign is over,” said Prince\r\n      Andrew.\n“Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they daren’t say\r\n      so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign, it won’t be\r\n      your skirmishing at Dürrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that will decide the\r\n      matter, but those who devised it,” said Bilíbin quoting one of his own\r\n      mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing. “The only\r\n      question is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor Alexander\r\n      and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia joins the Allies, Austria’s\r\n      hand will be forced and there will be war. If not it is merely a question\r\n      of settling where the preliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to be\r\n      drawn up.”\n“What an extraordinary genius!” Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,\r\n      clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, “and what luck\r\n      the man has!”\n“Buonaparte?” said Bilíbin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to\r\n      indicate that he was about to say something witty. “Buonaparte?” he\r\n      repeated, accentuating theu: “I think, however, now that he lays down\r\n      laws for Austria at Schönbrunn,il faut lui faire grâce de l’u!* I shall\r\n      certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!”\n* “We must let him off the u!”\n“But joking apart,” said Prince Andrew, “do you really think the campaign\r\n      is over?”\n“This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is not\r\n      used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the first place\r\n      because her provinces have been pillaged—they say the Holy Russian\r\n      army loots terribly—her army is destroyed, her capital taken, and\r\n      all this for thebeaux yeux* of His Sardinian Majesty. And therefore—this\r\n      is between ourselves—I instinctively feel that we are being\r\n      deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and projects\r\n      for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.”\n* Fine eyes.\n“Impossible!” cried Prince Andrew. “That would be too base.”\n“If we live we shall see,” replied Bilíbin, his face again becoming smooth\r\n      as a sign that the conversation was at an end.\nWhen Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a\r\n      clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he\r\n      felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far away\r\n      from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria’s treachery, Bonaparte’s new\r\n      triumph, tomorrow’s levee and parade, and the audience with the Emperor\r\n      Francis occupied his thoughts.\nHe closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry\r\n      and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now again\r\n      drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill, the\r\n      French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward\r\n      beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around, and he\r\n      experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since childhood.\nHe woke up...\n“Yes, that all happened!” he said, and, smiling happily to himself like a\r\n      child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber."

    "text": "Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first thought\r\n      that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the\r\n      Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite Austrian\r\n      adjutant, Bilíbin, and last night’s conversation. Having dressed for his\r\n      attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a\r\n      long time, he went into Bilíbin’s study fresh, animated, and handsome,\r\n      with his hand bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic\r\n      corps. With Prince Hippolyte Kurágin, who was a secretary to the embassy,\r\n      Bolkónski was already acquainted. Bilíbin introduced him to the others.\nThe gentlemen assembled at Bilíbin’s were young, wealthy, gay society men,\r\n      who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which Bilíbin, their leader,\r\n      calledles nôtres. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of diplomats,\r\n      evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or\r\n      politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to the\r\n      official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince Andrew as\r\n      one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From politeness\r\n      and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions about the army\r\n      and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip.\n* Ours.\n“But the best of it was,” said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow\r\n      diplomat, “that the Chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to\r\n      London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it. Can you fancy the\r\n      figure he cut?...”\n“But the worst of it, gentlemen—I am giving Kurágin away to you—is\r\n      that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking\r\n      advantage of it!”\nPrince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm.\r\n      He began to laugh.\n“Tell me about that!” he said.\n“Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!” cried several voices.\n“You, Bolkónski, don’t know,” said Bilíbin turning to Prince Andrew, “that\r\n      all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the Russian army)\r\n      are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women!”\n“La femme est la compagne de l’homme,”* announced Prince Hippolyte, and\r\n      began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.\n* “Woman is man’s companion.”\nBilíbin and the rest of “ours” burst out laughing in Hippolyte’s face, and\r\n      Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom—he had to admit—he\r\n      had almost been jealous on his wife’s account, was the butt of this set.\n“Oh, I must give you a treat,” Bilíbin whispered to Bolkónski. “Kurágin is\r\n      exquisite when he discusses politics—you should see his gravity!”\nHe sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to\r\n      him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two.\n“The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,” began Hippolyte\r\n      gazing round with importance at the others, “without expressing... as in\r\n      its last note... you understand... Besides, unless His Majesty the Emperor\r\n      derogates from the principle of our alliance...\n“Wait, I have not finished...” he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him by\r\n      the arm, “I believe that intervention will be stronger than\r\n      nonintervention. And...” he paused. “Finally one cannot impute the\r\n      nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.” And\r\n      he released Bolkónski’s arm to indicate that he had now quite finished.\n“Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden\r\n      mouth!” said Bilíbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with\r\n      satisfaction.\nEverybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently\r\n      distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild\r\n      laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.\n“Well now, gentlemen,” said Bilíbin, “Bolkónski is my guest in this house\r\n      and in Brünn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I can, with all the\r\n      pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would be easy, but here,\r\n      in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult, and I beg you all to\r\n      help me. Brünn’s attractions must be shown him. You can undertake the\r\n      theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the women.”\n“We must let him see Amelie, she’s exquisite!” said one of\r\n      “ours,” kissing his finger tips.\n“In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane\r\n      interests,” said Bilíbin.\n“I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality, gentlemen,\r\n      it is already time for me to go,” replied Prince Andrew looking at his\r\n      watch.\n“Where to?”\n“To the Emperor.”\n“Oh! Oh! Oh!”\n“Well,au revoir, Bolkónski!Au revoir, Prince! Come back early\r\n      to dinner,” cried several voices. “We’ll take you in hand.”\n“When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way\r\n      that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,” said Bilíbin,\r\n      accompanying him to the hall.\n“I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts, I\r\n      can’t,” replied Bolkónski, smiling.\n“Well, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving\r\n      audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can’t do it, as you\r\n      will see.”"

    "text": "At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had\r\n      been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his face\r\n      and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was over, the\r\n      adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed Bolkónski\r\n      that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor Francis\r\n      received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the conversation\r\n      began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed\r\n      confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.\n“Tell me, when did the battle begin?” he asked hurriedly.\nPrince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple: “Was\r\n      Kutúzov well? When had he left Krems?” and so on. The Emperor spoke as if\r\n      his sole aim were to put a given number of questions—the answers to\r\n      these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest him.\n“At what o’clock did the battle begin?” asked the Emperor.\n“I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o’clock the battle began at the\r\n      front, but at Dürrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in the\r\n      afternoon,” replied Bolkónski growing more animated and expecting that he\r\n      would have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had ready in his\r\n      mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor smiled and interrupted\r\n      him.\n“How many miles?”\n“From where to where, Your Majesty?”\n“From Dürrenstein to Krems.”\n“Three and a half miles, Your Majesty.”\n“The French have abandoned the left bank?”\n“According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the\r\n      night.”\n“Is there sufficient forage in Krems?”\n“Forage has not been supplied to the extent...”\nThe Emperor interrupted him.\n“At what o’clock was General Schmidt killed?”\n“At seven o’clock, I believe.”\n“At seven o’clock? It’s very sad, very sad!”\nThe Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and\r\n      was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he saw\r\n      friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday’s adjutant reproached\r\n      him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him his own house.\r\n      The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa\r\n      Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring on him. The\r\n      Empress’ chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The archduchess also\r\n      wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and for a few seconds\r\n      collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador took him by the\r\n      shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to him.\nContrary to Bilíbin’s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully\r\n      received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutúzov was awarded the\r\n      Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards.\r\n      Bolkónski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning\r\n      calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five in\r\n      the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to Bilíbin’s\r\n      house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit\r\n      to Brünn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz,\r\n      Bilíbin’s man, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the\r\n      front door.\nBefore returning to Bilíbin’s Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to\r\n      provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some time\r\n      in the shop.\n“What is it?” he asked.\n“Oh, your excellency!” said Franz, with difficulty rolling the portmanteau\r\n      into the vehicle, “we are to move on still farther. The scoundrel is again\r\n      at our heels!”\n“Eh? What?” asked Prince Andrew.\nBilíbin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.\n“There now! Confess that this is delightful,” said he. “This affair of the\r\n      Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without striking a blow!”\nPrince Andrew could not understand.\n“But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town\r\n      knows?”\n“I come from the archduchess’. I heard nothing there.”\n“And you didn’t see that everybody is packing up?”\n“I did not... What is it all about?” inquired Prince Andrew impatiently.\n“What’s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that\r\n      Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat is now\r\n      rushing along the road to Brünn and will be here in a day or two.”\n“What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?”\n“That is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.”\nBolkónski shrugged his shoulders.\n“But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It will\r\n      be cut off,” said he.\n“That’s just it,” answered Bilíbin. “Listen! The French entered Vienna as\r\n      I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those gentlemen,messieurs les maréchaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, mount and ride to\r\n      the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.) ‘Gentlemen,’ says one of\r\n      them, ‘you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there\r\n      are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand\r\n      men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross? But it\r\n      will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so\r\n      let us three go and take it!’ ‘Yes, let’s!’ say the others. And off they\r\n      go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on\r\n      this side of the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of\r\n      communication.”\n* The marshalls.\n“Stop jesting,” said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news grieved\r\n      him and yet he was pleased.\nAs soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless\r\n      situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it\r\n      out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from\r\n      the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!\r\n      Listening to Bilíbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he\r\n      would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that\r\n      could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the\r\n      executing of the plan.\n“Stop this jesting,” he said.\n“I am not jesting,” Bilíbin went on. “Nothing is truer or sadder.\r\n      These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they\r\n      assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to\r\n      negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter thetête-de-pont. *\r\n      They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the\r\n      Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to\r\n      see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these\r\n      gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and\r\n      meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the\r\n      bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches thetête-de-pont. At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince\r\n      Auersperg von Mautern himself. ‘Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army,\r\n      hero of the Turkish wars! Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another’s\r\n      hand.... The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince\r\n      Auersperg’s acquaintance.’ In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so\r\n      bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly\r\n      established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight\r\n      of Murat’s mantle and ostrich plumes,qu’il n’y voit que du feu, et oublie\r\n      celui qu’il devait faire faire sur l’ennemi!”*(2) In spite of the\r\n      animation of his speech, Bilíbin did not forget to pause after this mot to\r\n      give time for its due appreciation. “The French battalion rushes to the\r\n      bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of\r\n      all,” he went on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest\r\n      of his own story, “is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was\r\n      to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this\r\n      sergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge, was\r\n      about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently\r\n      wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says: ‘Prince, you are\r\n      being deceived, here are the French!’ Murat, seeing that all is lost if\r\n      the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned\r\n      astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: ‘I don’t recognize the\r\n      world-famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address\r\n      you like that!’ It was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his\r\n      dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must\r\n      own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly\r\n      stupidity, nor rascality....”\n* Bridgehead.\n* (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that\r\n     he ought to be firing at the enemy.\n“It may be treachery,” said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the gray\r\n      overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the\r\n      glory that awaited him.\n“Not that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,” replied\r\n      Bilíbin. “It’s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as at\r\n      Ulm... it is...”—he seemed to be trying to find the right\r\n      expression.“C’est... c’est du Mack. Nous sommes mackés(It is... it is a\r\n      bit of Mack. We areMacked),” he concluded, feeling that he had produced a\r\n      good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His hitherto puckered\r\n      brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a slight smile he began\r\n      to examine his nails.\n“Where are you off to?” he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen\r\n      and was going toward his room.\n“I am going away.”\n“Where to?”\n“To the army.”\n“But you meant to stay another two days?”\n“But now I am off at once.”\nAnd Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his\r\n      room.\n“Do you know,mon cher,” said Bilíbin following him, “I have been thinking\r\n      about you. Why are you going?”\nAnd in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles\r\n      vanished from his face.\nPrince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.\n“Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the\r\n      army now that it is in danger. I understand that.Mon cher, it is\r\n      heroism!”\n“Not at all,” said Prince Andrew.\n“But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other side\r\n      of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary, is to\r\n      take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for\r\n      anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been\r\n      dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our\r\n      ill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olmütz, and Olmütz is a very\r\n      decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in mycalèche.”\n“Do stop joking, Bilíbin,” cried Bolkónski.\n“I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are you\r\n      going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two things,”\r\n       and the skin over his left temple puckered, “either you will not reach\r\n      your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and\r\n      disgrace with Kutúzov’s whole army.”\nAnd Bilíbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was insoluble.\n“I cannot argue about it,” replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he thought:\r\n      “I am going to save the army.”\n“My dear fellow, you are a hero!” said Bilíbin."

    "text": "That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, Bolkónski set\r\n      off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and fearing to\r\n      be captured by the French on the way to Krems.\nIn Brünn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy\r\n      baggage was already being dispatched to Olmütz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince\r\n      Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with\r\n      great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed with\r\n      carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew took a\r\n      horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and weary, making\r\n      his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the commander in chief\r\n      and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the position of the army\r\n      reached him as he went along, and the appearance of the troops in their\r\n      disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.\n“Cette armée russe que l’or de l’Angleterre a transportée des extrémités\r\n      de l’univers, nous allons lui faire éprouver le même sort—(le sort\r\n      de l’armée d’Ulm).”* He remembered these words in Bonaparte’s address to\r\n      his army at the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him\r\n      astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded pride, and a\r\n      hope of glory. “And should there be nothing left but to die?” he thought.\r\n      “Well, if need be, I shall do it no worse than others.”\n* “That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of\r\n     the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same\r\n     fate—(the fate of the army at Ulm).”\nHe looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments, carts,\r\n      guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds\r\n      overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and sometimes\r\n      four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear could\r\n      reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and gun\r\n      carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the urging of\r\n      horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers. All along\r\n      the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some\r\n      not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for\r\n      something, and again soldiers straggling from their companies, crowds of\r\n      whom set off to the neighboring villages, or returned from them dragging\r\n      sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At each ascent or descent of the\r\n      road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant.\r\n      Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons\r\n      themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped, traces broke, and lungs were\r\n      strained with shouting. The officers directing the march rode backward and\r\n      forward between the carts. Their voices were but feebly heard amid the\r\n      uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility\r\n      of checking this disorder.\n“Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army,” thought Bolkónski, recalling\r\n      Bilíbin’s words.\nWishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to a\r\n      convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle,\r\n      evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking\r\n      like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and acalèche. A soldier was\r\n      driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the\r\n      leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting\r\n      his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate\r\n      shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of transport was\r\n      beating the soldier who was driving the woman’s vehicle for trying to get\r\n      ahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the\r\n      equipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned\r\n      out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen\r\n      shawl, cried:\n“Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven’s sake... Protect me!\r\n      What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh\r\n      Chasseurs.... They won’t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost our\r\n      people...”\n“I’ll flatten you into a pancake!” shouted the angry officer to the\r\n      soldier. “Turn back with your slut!”\n“Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?” screamed the\r\n      doctor’s wife.\n“Kindly let this cart pass. Don’t you see it’s a woman?” said Prince\r\n      Andrew riding up to the officer.\nThe officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the\r\n      soldier. “I’ll teach you to push on!... Back!”\n“Let them pass, I tell you!” repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his lips.\n“And who are you?” cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage, “who\r\n      areyou?Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here, not you! Go\r\n      back or I’ll flatten you into a pancake,” repeated he. This expression\r\n      evidently pleased him.\n“That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,” came a voice from\r\n      behind.\nPrince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless, tipsy\r\n      rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his\r\n      championship of the doctor’s wife in her queer trap might expose him to\r\n      what he dreaded more than anything in the world—to ridicule; but his\r\n      instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence Prince\r\n      Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his riding\r\n      whip.\n“Kind...ly let—them—pass!”\nThe officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.\n“It’s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there’s this\r\n      disorder,” he muttered. “Do as you like.”\nPrince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctor’s\r\n      wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a sense of\r\n      disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to\r\n      the village where he was told who the commander in chief was.\nOn reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,\r\n      intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort out\r\n      the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. “This is a\r\n      mob of scoundrels and not an army,” he was thinking as he went up to the\r\n      window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by name.\nHe turned round. Nesvítski’s handsome face looked out of the little\r\n      window. Nesvítski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and\r\n      flourishing his arm, called him to enter.\n“Bolkónski! Bolkónski!... Don’t you hear? Eh? Come quick...” he shouted.\nEntering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvítski and another adjutant\r\n      having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he had\r\n      any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm. This was\r\n      particularly noticeable on Nesvítski’s usually laughing countenance.\n“Where is the commander in chief?” asked Bolkónski.\n“Here, in that house,” answered the adjutant.\n“Well, is it true that it’s peace and capitulation?” asked Nesvítski.\n“I was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could do\r\n      to get here.”\n“And we, my dear boy! It’s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack, we’re\r\n      getting it still worse,” said Nesvítski. “But sit down and have something\r\n      to eat.”\n“You won’t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,\r\n      Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,” said the other\r\n      adjutant.\n“Where are headquarters?”\n“We are to spend the night in Znaim.”\n“Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,” said Nesvítski.\r\n      “They’ve made up splendid packs for me—fit to cross the Bohemian\r\n      mountains with. It’s a bad lookout, old fellow! But what’s the matter with\r\n      you? You must be ill to shiver like that,” he added, noticing that Prince\r\n      Andrew winced as at an electric shock.\n“It’s nothing,” replied Prince Andrew.\nHe had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor’s wife and the\r\n      convoy officer.\n“What is the commander in chief doing here?” he asked.\n“I can’t make out at all,” said Nesvítski.\n“Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable, abominable,\r\n      quite abominable!” said Prince Andrew, and he went off to the house where\r\n      the commander in chief was.\nPassing by Kutúzov’s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his\r\n      suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince Andrew\r\n      entered the passage. Kutúzov himself, he was told, was in the house with\r\n      Prince Bagratión and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian general who had\r\n      succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozlóvski was squatting on his\r\n      heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned up, was hastily\r\n      writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlóvski’s face looked worn—he\r\n      too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did\r\n      not even nod to him.\n“Second line... have you written it?” he continued dictating to the clerk.\r\n      “The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...”\n“One can’t write so fast, your honor,” said the clerk, glancing\r\n      angrily and disrespectfully at Kozlóvski.\nThrough the door came the sounds of Kutúzov’s voice, excited and\r\n      dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the sound\r\n      of these voices, the inattentive way Kozlóvski looked at him, the\r\n      disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and\r\n      Kozlóvski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in\r\n      chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near\r\n      the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and disastrous was\r\n      about to happen.\nHe turned to Kozlóvski with urgent questions.\n“Immediately, Prince,” said Kozlóvski. “Dispositions for Bagratión.”\n“What about capitulation?”\n“Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.”\nPrince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard. Just as\r\n      he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and Kutúzov\r\n      with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway. Prince Andrew\r\n      stood right in front of Kutúzov but the expression of the commander in\r\n      chief’s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and\r\n      anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He looked straight at his\r\n      adjutant’s face without recognizing him.\n“Well, have you finished?” said he to Kozlóvski.\n“One moment, your excellency.”\nBagratión, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm, impassive\r\n      face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.\n“I have the honor to present myself,” repeated Prince Andrew rather\r\n      loudly, handing Kutúzov an envelope.\n“Ah, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!”\nKutúzov went out into the porch with Bagratión.\n“Well, good-by, Prince,” said he to Bagratión. “My blessing, and may\r\n      Christ be with you in your great endeavor!”\nHis face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left\r\n      hand he drew Bagratión toward him, and with his right, on which he wore a\r\n      ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently\r\n      habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagratión kissed him on the neck\r\n      instead.\n“Christ be with you!” Kutúzov repeated and went toward his carriage. “Get\r\n      in with me,” said he to Bolkónski.\n“Your excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain with\r\n      Prince Bagratión’s detachment.”\n“Get in,” said Kutúzov, and noticing that Bolkónski still delayed, he\r\n      added: “I need good officers myself, need them myself!”\nThey got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.\n“There is still much, much before us,” he said, as if with an old man’s\r\n      penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkónski’s mind. “If a\r\n      tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,” he added as if\r\n      speaking to himself.\nPrince Andrew glanced at Kutúzov’s face only a foot distant from him and\r\n      involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his\r\n      temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye\r\n      socket. “Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men’s death,”\r\n       thought Bolkónski.\n“That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,” he said.\nKutúzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been\r\n      saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying on\r\n      the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew. There was\r\n      not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he questioned\r\n      Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor, about\r\n      the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair, and about\r\n      some ladies they both knew."

    "text": "On November 1 Kutúzov had received, through a spy, news that the army he\r\n      commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that the\r\n      French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in immense\r\n      force upon Kutúzov’s line of communication with the troops that were\r\n      arriving from Russia. If Kutúzov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleon’s\r\n      army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely\r\n      and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he would find\r\n      himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If Kutúzov decided to abandon the\r\n      road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would have to\r\n      march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains, defending\r\n      himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a\r\n      junction with Buxhöwden. If Kutúzov decided to retreat along the road from\r\n      Krems to Olmütz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia, he risked\r\n      being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the Vienna\r\n      bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having to accept\r\n      battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong, who would hem\r\n      him in from two sides.\nKutúzov chose this latter course.\nThe French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were\r\n      advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles off on\r\n      the line of Kutúzov’s retreat. If he reached Znaim before the French,\r\n      there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the French forestall\r\n      him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as\r\n      that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall the French with his\r\n      whole army was impossible. The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim\r\n      was shorter and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.\nThe night he received the news, Kutúzov sent Bagratión’s vanguard, four\r\n      thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to the\r\n      Vienna-Znaim road. Bagratión was to make this march without resting, and\r\n      to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded in\r\n      forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible. Kutúzov\r\n      himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.\nMarching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his\r\n      hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by\r\n      the way, Bagratión came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrünn a few\r\n      hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrünn from Vienna.\r\n      Kutúzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he\r\n      could reach Znaim. Hence Bagratión with his four thousand hungry,\r\n      exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came\r\n      upon him at Hollabrünn, which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate\r\n      made the impossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the\r\n      Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try\r\n      to deceive Kutúzov in a similar way. Meeting Bagratión’s weak detachment\r\n      on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutúzov’s whole army. To be able to\r\n      crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who\r\n      were on their way from Vienna, and with this object offered a three days’\r\n      truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without\r\n      moving. Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already\r\n      proceeding, and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary\r\n      bloodshed. Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced\r\n      posts, believed Murat’s emissary and retired, leaving Bagratión’s\r\n      division exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace\r\n      negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days’ truce.\r\n      Bagratión replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a\r\n      truce and sent his adjutant to Kutúzov to report the offer he had\r\n      received.\nA truce was Kutúzov’s sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagratión’s\r\n      exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys\r\n      (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance if but one stage\r\n      nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and a quite unexpected,\r\n      chance of saving the army. On receiving the news he immediately dispatched\r\n      Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy\r\n      camp. Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer\r\n      terms of capitulation, and meanwhile Kutúzov sent his adjutants back to\r\n      hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire\r\n      army along the Krems-Znaim road. Bagratión’s exhausted and hungry\r\n      detachment, which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the\r\n      whole army, had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as\r\n      strong as itself.\nKutúzov’s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in\r\n      no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass, and\r\n      also that Murat’s mistake would very soon be discovered, proved correct.\r\n      As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Schönbrunn, sixteen miles from\r\n      Hollabrünn) received Murat’s dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a\r\n      capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat:\nSchönbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,\nat eight o’clock in the morning\nTo PRINCE MURAT,\nI cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only my\r\n      advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order.\r\n      You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break the armistice\r\n      immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general who signed\r\n      that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one but the Emperor\r\n      of Russia has that right.\nIf, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will ratify\r\n      it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian army.... You are\r\n      in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.\nThe Russian Emperor’s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing\r\n      when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians let\r\n      themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are\r\n      letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.\nNAPOLEON\nBonaparte’s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to Murat.\r\n      Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all the Guards\r\n      to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim escape, and\r\n      Bagratión’s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires, dried and warmed\r\n      themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time for three days, and\r\n      not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him."

    "text": "Between three and four o’clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who had\r\n      persisted in his request to Kutúzov, arrived at Grunth and reported\r\n      himself to Bagratión. Bonaparte’s adjutant had not yet reached Murat’s\r\n      detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagratión’s detachment no\r\n      one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They talked of peace\r\n      but did not believe in its possibility; others talked of a battle but also\r\n      disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement. Bagratión, knowing Bolkónski\r\n      to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and\r\n      special marks of favor, explaining to him that there would probably be an\r\n      engagement that day or the next, and giving him full liberty to remain\r\n      with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the\r\n      order of retreat, “which is also very important.”\n“However, there will hardly be an engagement today,” said Bagratión\r\n      as if to reassure Prince Andrew.\n“If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he\r\n      can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he wishes to stay\r\n      with me, let him... he’ll be of use here if he’s a brave\r\n      officer,” thought Bagratión. Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the\r\n      prince’s permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of\r\n      the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order.\r\n      The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his\r\n      forefinger, who was fond of speaking French though he spoke it badly,\r\n      offered to conduct Prince Andrew.\nOn all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who seemed\r\n      to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches, and fencing\r\n      from the village.\n“There now, Prince! We can’t stop those fellows,” said the staff officer\r\n      pointing to the soldiers. “The officers don’t keep them in hand. And\r\n      there,” he pointed to a sutler’s tent, “they crowd in and sit. This\r\n      morning I turned them all out and now look, it’s full again. I must go\r\n      there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won’t take a moment.”\n“Yes, let’s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,” said\r\n      Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.\n“Why didn’t you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you something.”\nThey dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and\r\n      weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.\n“Now what does this mean, gentlemen?” said the staff officer, in the\r\n      reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once.\r\n      “You know it won’t do to leave your posts like this. The prince gave\r\n      orders that no one should leave his post. Now you, Captain,” and he turned\r\n      to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had\r\n      given them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose when\r\n      they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.\n“Well, aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Captain Túshin?” he continued. “One\r\n      would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example, yet\r\n      here you are without your boots! The alarm will be sounded and you’ll be\r\n      in a pretty position without your boots!” (The staff officer smiled.)\r\n      “Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you, all!” he added in a\r\n      tone of command.\nPrince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer\r\n      Túshin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to the\r\n      other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes from\r\n      Prince Andrew to the staff officer.\n“The soldiers say it feels easier without boots,” said Captain Túshin\r\n      smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing to adopt a\r\n      jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his jest was\r\n      unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.\n“Kindly return to your posts,” said the staff officer trying to preserve\r\n      his gravity.\nPrince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer’s small figure. There\r\n      was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic, but\r\n      extremely attractive.\nThe staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.\nHaving ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking\r\n      soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some\r\n      entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up\r\n      red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite the\r\n      cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants;\r\n      spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the\r\n      bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at the\r\n      entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some dozens\r\n      of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the\r\n      entrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot\r\n      to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.\n“Voilà l’agrément des camps, monsieur le prince,”* said the staff\r\n      officer.\n* “This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.”\nThey rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be\r\n      seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.\n“That’s our battery,” said the staff officer indicating the highest point.\r\n      “It’s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots. You can see\r\n      everything from there; let’s go there, Prince.”\n“Thank you very much, I will go on alone,” said Prince Andrew, wishing to\r\n      rid himself of this staff officer’s company, “please don’t trouble\r\n      yourself further.”\nThe staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.\nThe farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and\r\n      cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been in\r\n      the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven miles\r\n      away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be\r\n      felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the more\r\n      confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in their\r\n      greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company officers\r\n      were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in the ribs and\r\n      telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over the whole place\r\n      were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry\r\n      chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed,\r\n      drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and\r\n      crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers. In one company dinner was\r\n      ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler,\r\n      waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a\r\n      wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been\r\n      tasted.\nAnother company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka, crowded\r\n      round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting a keg,\r\n      filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The soldiers\r\n      lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces, emptied\r\n      them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from the sergeant\r\n      major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and wiping them on\r\n      the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were as serene as if all\r\n      this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment, and not within\r\n      sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would\r\n      be left on the field. After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines\r\n      of the Kiev grenadiers—fine fellows busy with similar peaceful\r\n      affairs—near the shelter of the regimental commander, higher than\r\n      and different from the others, Prince Andrew came out in front of a\r\n      platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him\r\n      while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him\r\n      regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally. A stout major\r\n      was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams kept\r\n      repeating:\n“It’s a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest, honorable,\r\n      and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him, he’s a\r\n      scoundrel. Go on! Go on!”\nSo the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural\r\n      screams, continued.\n“Go on, go on!” said the major.\nA young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face\r\n      stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as\r\n      he rode by.\nPrince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front\r\n      line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks,\r\n      but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that\r\n      morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one\r\n      another’s faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who formed\r\n      the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers who,\r\n      jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.\nSince early morning—despite an injunction not to approach the picket\r\n      line—the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The\r\n      soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity, no\r\n      longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and grew\r\n      weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look at the\r\n      French.\n“Look! Look there!” one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a\r\n      Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and\r\n      was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. “Hark to him\r\n      jabbering! Fine, isn’t it? It’s all the Frenchy can do to keep up with\r\n      him. There now, Sídorov!”\n“Wait a bit and listen. It’s fine!” answered Sídorov, who\r\n      was considered an adept at French.\nThe soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dólokhov. Prince Andrew\r\n      recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. Dólokhov had\r\n      come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with his\r\n      captain.\n“Now then, go on, go on!” incited the officer, bending forward and trying\r\n      not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him. “More,\r\n      please: more! What’s he saying?”\nDólokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot dispute\r\n      with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the campaign.\r\n      The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was trying to\r\n      prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm,\r\n      while Dólokhov maintained that the Russians had not surrendered but had\r\n      beaten the French.\n“We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,” said\r\n      Dólokhov.\n“Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!” said the\r\n      French grenadier.\nThe French onlookers and listeners laughed.\n“We’ll make you dance as we did under Suvórov...,” * said Dólokhov.\n*“On vous fera danser.”\n“Qu’ est-ce qu’il chante?”* asked a Frenchman.\n* “What’s he singing about?”\n“It’s ancient history,” said another, guessing that it referred to a\r\n      former war. “The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the\r\n      others...”\n“Bonaparte...” began Dólokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.\n“Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor!Sacré nom...!”cried he angrily.\n“The devil skin your Emperor.”\nAnd Dólokhov swore at him in coarse soldier’s Russian and shouldering his\r\n      musket walked away.\n“Let us go, Iván Lukích,” he said to the captain.\n“Ah, that’s the way to talk French,” said the picket soldiers. “Now,\r\n      Sídorov, you have a try!”\nSídorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless\r\n      sounds very fast:“Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kaská,”he said, trying\r\n      to give an expressive intonation to his voice.\n“Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!” came peals of such healthy and\r\n      good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French\r\n      involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to\r\n      unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as quickly\r\n      as possible.\nBut the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and\r\n      entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon\r\n      confronted one another as before."

    "text": "Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince Andrew\r\n      made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him\r\n      the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped beside the\r\n      farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an artillery\r\n      sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the officer\r\n      arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing. Behind the\r\n      guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and\r\n      artillerymen’s bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest cannon,\r\n      was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of\r\n      officers’ voices in eager conversation.\nIt was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the\r\n      greater part of the enemy’s opened out from this battery. Just facing it,\r\n      on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schön Grabern could be\r\n      seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops amid the\r\n      smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were evidently in the\r\n      village itself and behind the hill. To the left from that village, amid\r\n      the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it was impossible to\r\n      see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was posted on a rather\r\n      steep incline which dominated the French position. Our infantry were\r\n      stationed there, and at the farthest point the dragoons. In the center,\r\n      where Túshin’s battery stood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying\r\n      the position, was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the\r\n      brook separating us from Schön Grabern. On the left our troops were close\r\n      to a copse, in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling\r\n      wood. The French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they\r\n      could easily outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was a steep\r\n      and deep dip, making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire.\r\n      Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a\r\n      plan of the position. He made some notes on two points, intending to\r\n      mention them to Bagratión. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the\r\n      artillery in the center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the\r\n      other side of the dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in\r\n      chief, closely following the mass movements and general orders, and\r\n      constantly studying historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured\r\n      to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad\r\n      outline. He imagined only important possibilities: “If the enemy attacks\r\n      the right flank,” he said to himself, “the Kiev grenadiers and the Podólsk\r\n      chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up.\r\n      In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack.\r\n      If they attack our center we, having the center battery on this high\r\n      ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat to the\r\n      dip by echelons.” So he reasoned.... All the time he had been beside the\r\n      gun, he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly, but as often\r\n      happens had not understood a word of what they were saying. Suddenly,\r\n      however, he was struck by a voice coming from the shed, and its tone was\r\n      so sincere that he could not but listen.\n“No, friend,” said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a\r\n      familiar voice, “what I say is that if it were possible to know what is\r\n      beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That’s so, friend.”\nAnother, a younger voice, interrupted him: “Afraid or not, you can’t\r\n      escape it anyhow.”\n“All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,” said a third manly\r\n      voice interrupting them both. “Of course you artillery men are very wise,\r\n      because you can take everything along with you—vodka and snacks.”\nAnd the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer, laughed.\n“Yes, one is afraid,” continued the first speaker, he of the familiar\r\n      voice. “One is afraid of the unknown, that’s what it is. Whatever we may\r\n      say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is no sky but only an\r\n      atmosphere.”\nThe manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.\n“Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Túshin,” it said.\n“Why,” thought Prince Andrew, “that’s the captain who\r\n      stood up in the sutler’s hut without his boots.” He recognized the\r\n      agreeable, philosophizing voice with pleasure.\n“Some herb vodka? Certainly!” said Túshin. “But still, to\r\n      conceive a future life...”\nHe did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and\r\n      nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it had\r\n      not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near the\r\n      shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground\r\n      seemed to groan at the terrible impact.\nAnd immediately Túshin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and\r\n      his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed by\r\n      the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who hurried off\r\n      to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran."

    "text": "Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery, looking\r\n      at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes ran rapidly over\r\n      the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the\r\n      French now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left. The\r\n      smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two mounted Frenchmen, probably\r\n      adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A small but distinctly visible\r\n      enemy column was moving down the hill, probably to strengthen the front\r\n      line. The smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another\r\n      puff appeared, followed by a report. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew\r\n      turned his horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagratión. He\r\n      heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent. Evidently\r\n      our guns had begun to reply. From the bottom of the slope, where the\r\n      parleys had taken place, came the report of musketry.\nLemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte’s stern letter, and\r\n      Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once moved his\r\n      forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian wings, hoping\r\n      before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to crush the\r\n      contemptible detachment that stood before him.\n“It has begun. Here it is!” thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood rush\r\n      to his heart. “But where and how will my Toulon present itself?”\nPassing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking\r\n      vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid\r\n      movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready, and on\r\n      all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart.\r\n      “It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!” was what the face of\r\n      each soldier and each officer seemed to say.\nBefore he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw,\r\n      in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him.\r\n      The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white\r\n      horse, was Prince Bagratión. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for him to\r\n      come up; Prince Bagratión reined in his horse and recognizing Prince\r\n      Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew told him\r\n      what he had seen.\nThe feeling, “It has begun! Here it is!” was seen even on Prince\r\n      Bagratión’s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.\r\n      Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and\r\n      wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking and feeling\r\n      at that moment. “Is there anything at all behind that impassive face?”\r\n       Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince Bagratión bent his head\r\n      in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and said, “Very\r\n      good!” in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and\r\n      was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out\r\n      of breath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly. Prince Bagratión, uttering\r\n      his words with an Oriental accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to\r\n      impress the fact that there was no need to hurry. However, he put his\r\n      horse to a trot in the direction of Túshin’s battery. Prince Andrew\r\n      followed with the suite. Behind Prince Bagratión rode an officer of the\r\n      suite, the prince’s personal adjutant, Zherkóv, an orderly officer, the\r\n      staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian—an\r\n      accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of\r\n      curiosity. The accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around him with\r\n      a naïve smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the\r\n      hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on his\r\n      horse with a convoy officer’s saddle.\n“He wants to see a battle,” said Zherkóv to Bolkónski, pointing to the\r\n      accountant, “but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already.”\n“Oh, leave off!” said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning\r\n      smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkóv’s joke, and\r\n      purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.\n“It is very strange,mon Monsieur Prince,” said the staff officer. (He\r\n      remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a\r\n      prince, but could not get it quite right.)\nBy this time they were all approaching Túshin’s battery, and a ball struck\r\n      the ground in front of them.\n“What’s that that has fallen?” asked the accountant with a naïve smile.\n“A French pancake,” answered Zherkóv.\n“So that’s what they hit with?” asked the accountant. “How awful!”\nHe seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking when\r\n      they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended\r\n      with a thud into something soft...f-f-flop!and a Cossack, riding a\r\n      little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with his\r\n      horse. Zherkóv and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned\r\n      their horses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack, and\r\n      examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse\r\n      still struggled.\nPrince Bagratión screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the cause\r\n      of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say, “Is it\r\n      worth while noticing trifles?” He reined in his horse with the care of a\r\n      skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his saber which had\r\n      caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of a kind no longer in\r\n      general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suvórov giving his\r\n      saber to Bagratión in Italy, and the recollection was particularly\r\n      pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery at which Prince\r\n      Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.\n“Whose company?” asked Prince Bagratión of an artilleryman standing by the\r\n      ammunition wagon.\nHe asked, “Whose company?” but he really meant, “Are you frightened here?”\r\n       and the artilleryman understood him.\n“Captain Túshin’s, your excellency!” shouted the red-haired, freckled\r\n      gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.\n“Yes, yes,” muttered Bagratión as if considering something, and he rode\r\n      past the limbers to the farthest cannon.\nAs he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his\r\n      suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see\r\n      the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its\r\n      former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding a\r\n      mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with a\r\n      trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon’s mouth. The short,\r\n      round-shouldered Captain Túshin, stumbling over the tail of the gun\r\n      carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out shading\r\n      his eyes with his small hand.\n“Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,” cried he in a feeble\r\n      voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to his weak\r\n      figure. “Number Two!” he squeaked. “Fire, Medvédev!”\nBagratión called to him, and Túshin, raising three fingers to his cap with\r\n      a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a\r\n      priest’s benediction, approached the general. Though Túshin’s guns had\r\n      been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary balls at\r\n      the village of Schön Grabern visible just opposite, in front of which\r\n      large masses of French were advancing.\nNo one had given Túshin orders where and at what to fire, but after\r\n      consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchénko, for whom he had great\r\n      respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the\r\n      village. “Very good!” said Bagratión in reply to the officer’s report, and\r\n      began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him.\r\n      The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the height on which\r\n      the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet flowed,\r\n      the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much\r\n      farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed\r\n      out to Bagratión a French column that was outflanking us. To the left the\r\n      horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince Bagratión ordered two\r\n      battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank. The\r\n      officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these\r\n      battalions went away, the guns would remain without support. Prince\r\n      Bagratión turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in\r\n      silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer’s remark was just and\r\n      that really no answer could be made to it. But at that moment an adjutant\r\n      galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the\r\n      hollow and news that immense masses of the French were coming down upon\r\n      them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the\r\n      Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagratión bowed his head in sign of assent and\r\n      approval. He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the\r\n      dragoons with orders to attack the French. But this adjutant returned half\r\n      an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already\r\n      retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on\r\n      him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some\r\n      sharpshooters into the wood.\n“Very good!” said Bagratión.\nAs he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and as\r\n      it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself,\r\n      Prince Bagratión sent Zherkóv to tell the general in command (the one who\r\n      had paraded his regiment before Kutúzov at Braunau) that he must retreat\r\n      as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear, as the right flank\r\n      would probably not be able to withstand the enemy’s attack very long.\r\n      About Túshin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all\r\n      was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagratión’s\r\n      colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and,\r\n      to his surprise, found that no orders were really given, but that Prince\r\n      Bagratión tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity, by\r\n      accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was done, if not by his\r\n      direct command, at least in accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew\r\n      noticed, however, that though what happened was due to chance and was\r\n      independent of the commander’s will, owing to the tact Bagratión showed,\r\n      his presence was very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed\r\n      countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew\r\n      more cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious to display their\r\n      courage before him."

    "text": "Prince Bagratión, having reached the highest point of our right flank,\r\n      began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on\r\n      account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to the\r\n      hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the\r\n      actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a bleeding\r\n      head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him\r\n      under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting\r\n      blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth. Another was\r\n      walking sturdily by himself but without his musket, groaning aloud and\r\n      swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while blood from it was\r\n      streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had that moment been\r\n      wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering. Crossing a road\r\n      they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground;\r\n      they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded. The\r\n      soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and despite the\r\n      general’s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating. In front of them\r\n      rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an officer\r\n      catching sight of Bagratión rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating\r\n      soldiers, ordering them back. Bagratión rode up to the ranks along which\r\n      shots crackled now here and now there, drowning the sound of voices and\r\n      the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with smoke. The excited faces\r\n      of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some were using their ramrods,\r\n      others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their\r\n      pouches, while others were firing, though who they were firing at could\r\n      not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away. A\r\n      pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard. “What is\r\n      this?” thought Prince Andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers. “It can’t\r\n      be an attack, for they are not moving; it can’t be a square—for they\r\n      are not drawn up for that.”\nThe commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a\r\n      pleasant smile—his eyelids drooping more than half over his old\r\n      eyes, giving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagratión and welcomed him\r\n      as a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had\r\n      been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been\r\n      repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack had been\r\n      repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had occurred to\r\n      his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what had happened\r\n      during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and could not say\r\n      with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had\r\n      been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement of the action\r\n      balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and\r\n      that afterwards someone had shouted “Cavalry!” and our men had begun\r\n      firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry which had disappeared,\r\n      but at French infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our\r\n      men. Prince Bagratión bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what\r\n      he had desired and expected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to\r\n      bring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just\r\n      passed. Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on Prince\r\n      Bagratión’s face at this moment. It expressed the concentrated and happy\r\n      resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run\r\n      before plunging into the water. The dull, sleepy expression was no longer\r\n      there, nor the affectation of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk’s\r\n      eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on\r\n      anything although his movements were still slow and measured.\nThe commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagratión, entreating him\r\n      to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were. “Please,\r\n      your excellency, for God’s sake!” he kept saying, glancing for support at\r\n      an officer of the suite who turned away from him. “There, you see!” and he\r\n      drew attention to the bullets whistling, singing, and hissing continually\r\n      around them. He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a\r\n      carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: “We are used to it,\r\n      but you, sir, will blister your hands.” He spoke as if those bullets could\r\n      not kill him, and his half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to\r\n      his words. The staff officer joined in the colonel’s appeals, but\r\n      Bagratión did not reply; he only gave an order to cease firing and\r\n      re-form, so as to give room for the two approaching battalions. While he\r\n      was speaking, the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven\r\n      by a rising wind, began to move from right to left as if drawn by an\r\n      invisible hand, and the hill opposite, with the French moving about on it,\r\n      opened out before them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French\r\n      column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground. One\r\n      could already see the soldiers’ shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from\r\n      the men, and see the standard flapping against its staff.\n“They march splendidly,” remarked someone in Bagratión’s suite.\nThe head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash\r\n      would take place on this side of it...\nThe remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and\r\n      moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came two\r\n      battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had reached\r\n      Bagratión, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be\r\n      heard. On their left flank, nearest to Bagratión, marched a company\r\n      commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy expression—the\r\n      same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that moment he was\r\n      clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he\r\n      passed the commander.\nWith the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with his\r\n      muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full height\r\n      without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of\r\n      the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close to his leg a\r\n      narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real weapon) and\r\n      looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing\r\n      step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all the\r\n      powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best\r\n      possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy.\r\n      “Left... left... left...” he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate\r\n      step; and in time to this, with stern but varied faces, the wall of\r\n      soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step, and each one\r\n      of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each\r\n      alternate step, “Left... left... left...” A fat major skirted a bush,\r\n      puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face\r\n      showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with\r\n      his company. A cannon ball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of\r\n      Bagratión and his suite, and fell into the column to the measure of“Left... left!”“Close up!” came the company commander’s voice in jaunty\r\n      tones. The soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball\r\n      had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who\r\n      had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling\r\n      into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence\r\n      and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one seemed to\r\n      hearleft... left... left.\n“Well done, lads!” said Prince Bagratión.\n“Glad to do our best, your ex’len-lency!” came a confused shout from the\r\n      ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagratión\r\n      as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: “We know that\r\n      ourselves!” Another, without looking round, as though fearing to relax,\r\n      shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.\nThe order was given to halt and down knapsacks.\nBagratión rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted.\r\n      He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his felt coat,\r\n      stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the French\r\n      column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.\n“Forward, with God!” said Bagratión, in a resolute, sonorous voice,\r\n      turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms, he\r\n      went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a\r\n      cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him\r\n      forward, and experienced great happiness.\nThe French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagratión,\r\n      could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their\r\n      faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered legs\r\n      and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince Bagratión\r\n      gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the\r\n      ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the French, smoke\r\n      appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots sounded. Several\r\n      of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer who had marched so\r\n      gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first report was heard,\r\n      Bagratión looked round and shouted, “Hurrah!”\n“Hurrah—ah!—ah!” rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and\r\n      passing Bagratión and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but\r\n      joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe."

    "text": "The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank.\r\n      In the center Túshin’s forgotten battery, which had managed to set fire to\r\n      the Schön Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The French were\r\n      putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus gave us time\r\n      to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in\r\n      the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the different companies\r\n      did not get mixed. But our left—which consisted of the Azóv and\r\n      Podólsk infantry and the Pávlograd hussars—was simultaneously\r\n      attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was\r\n      thrown into confusion. Bagratión had sent Zherkóv to the general\r\n      commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately.\nZherkóv, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about and\r\n      galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagratión than his courage failed\r\n      him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous.\nHaving reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the\r\n      firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they\r\n      could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.\nThe command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of\r\n      the regiment Kutúzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which Dólokhov was\r\n      serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had been\r\n      assigned to the commander of the Pávlograd regiment in which Rostóv was\r\n      serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were much\r\n      exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on the\r\n      right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged in\r\n      discussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the\r\n      regiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the\r\n      impending action. From privates to general they were not expecting a\r\n      battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the\r\n      horses and the infantry collecting wood.\n“He higher iss dan I in rank,” said the German colonel of the hussars,\r\n      flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, “so let him do what\r\n      he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars... Bugler, sount ze retreat!”\nBut haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling together,\r\n      thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes of Lannes’\r\n      sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within\r\n      twice the range of a musket shot. The general in command of the infantry\r\n      went toward his horse with jerky steps, and having mounted drew himself up\r\n      very straight and tall and rode to the Pávlograd commander. The commanders\r\n      met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts.\n“Once again, Colonel,” said the general, “I can’t leave half my men in the\r\n      wood. Ibegof you, Ibegof you,” he repeated, “to occupy thepositionand prepare for an attack.”\n“I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!” suddenly\r\n      replied the irate colonel. “If you vere in the cavalry...”\n“I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if you\r\n      are not aware of the fact...”\n“Quite avare, your excellency,” suddenly shouted the colonel, touching his\r\n      horse and turning purple in the face. “Vill you be so goot to come to ze\r\n      front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don’t vish to destroy my men\r\n      for your pleasure!”\n“You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure and I\r\n      won’t allow it to be said!”\nTaking the colonel’s outburst as a challenge to his courage, the general\r\n      expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as if\r\n      their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets. They reached\r\n      the front, several bullets sped over them, and they halted in silence.\r\n      There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line, for from where they had\r\n      been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act\r\n      among the bushes and broken ground, as well as that the French were\r\n      outflanking our left. The general and colonel looked sternly and\r\n      significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle,\r\n      each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other. Both passed\r\n      the examination successfully. As there was nothing to be said, and neither\r\n      wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to\r\n      leave the range of fire, they would have remained there for a long time\r\n      testing each other’s courage had it not been that just then they heard the\r\n      rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The\r\n      French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer\r\n      possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off\r\n      from the line of retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient\r\n      the position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through\r\n      for themselves.\nThe squadron in which Rostóv was serving had scarcely time to mount before\r\n      it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge, there was\r\n      nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that terrible\r\n      dividing line of uncertainty and fear—resembling the line separating\r\n      the living from the dead—lay between them. All were conscious of\r\n      this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross it or not, and\r\n      how they would cross it, agitated them all.\nThe colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put to\r\n      him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having his\r\n      own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor of an\r\n      attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang out and\r\n      the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards. Still no one\r\n      moved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that\r\n      the commander did not himself know what to do, and this irresolution\r\n      communicated itself to the men.\n“If only they would be quick!” thought Rostóv, feeling that at last the\r\n      time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often\r\n      heard from his fellow hussars.\n“Fo’ward, with God, lads!” rang out Denísov’s voice. “At a twot fo’ward!”\nThe horses’ croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the\r\n      reins and started of his own accord.\nBefore him, on the right, Rostóv saw the front lines of his hussars and\r\n      still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took\r\n      to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.\n“Faster!” came the word of command, and Rostóv felt Rook’s flanks drooping\r\n      as he broke into a gallop.\nRostóv anticipated his horse’s movements and became more and more elated.\r\n      He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been in the\r\n      middle of the line that had seemed so terrible—and now he had\r\n      crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but everything\r\n      was becoming more and more happy and animated. “Oh, how I will slash at\r\n      him!” thought Rostóv, gripping the hilt of his saber.\n“Hur-a-a-a-ah!” came a roar of voices. “Let anyone come my way now,”\r\n       thought Rostóv driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a full\r\n      gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was already\r\n      visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the\r\n      squadron. Rostóv raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant\r\n      the trooper Nikítenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and\r\n      Rostóv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with\r\n      unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From behind him\r\n      Bondarchúk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked angrily at\r\n      him. Bondarchúk’s horse swerved and galloped past.\n“How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!” Rostóv asked and\r\n      answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a field.\r\n      Instead of the moving horses and hussars’ backs, he saw nothing before him\r\n      but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There was warm blood\r\n      under his arm. “No, I am wounded and the horse is killed.” Rook tried to\r\n      rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his rider’s leg. Blood was\r\n      flowing from his head; he struggled but could not rise. Rostóv also tried\r\n      to rise but fell back, his sabretache having become entangled in the\r\n      saddle. Where our men were, and where the French, he did not know. There\r\n      was no one near.\nHaving disentangled his leg, he rose. “Where, on which side, was now the\r\n      line that had so sharply divided the two armies?” he asked himself and\r\n      could not answer. “Can something bad have happened to me?” he wondered as\r\n      he got up: and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was\r\n      hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if it were not his. He\r\n      examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find blood on it. “Ah, here\r\n      are people coming,” he thought joyfully, seeing some men running toward\r\n      him. “They will help me!” In front came a man wearing a strange shako and\r\n      a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose. Then came two\r\n      more, and many more running behind. One of them said something strange,\r\n      not in Russian. In among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos\r\n      was a Russian hussar. He was being held by the arms and his horse was\r\n      being led behind him.\n“It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will take me\r\n      too? Who are these men?” thought Rostóv, scarcely believing his eyes. “Can\r\n      they be French?” He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though but a\r\n      moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to\r\n      pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his\r\n      eyes. “Who are they? Why are they running? Can they be coming at me? And\r\n      why? To kill me?Mewhom everyone is so fond of?” He remembered his\r\n      mother’s love for him, and his family’s, and his friends’, and the enemy’s\r\n      intention to kill him seemed impossible. “But perhaps they may do it!” For\r\n      more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the\r\n      situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was\r\n      already so close that the expression of his face could be seen. And the\r\n      excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his\r\n      breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostóv. He seized his pistol\r\n      and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his\r\n      might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and\r\n      conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the feeling\r\n      of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that of fear for\r\n      his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly leaping the\r\n      furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at\r\n      catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale, young face to look\r\n      back. A shudder of terror went through him: “No, better not look,” he\r\n      thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more. The\r\n      French had fallen behind, and just as he looked round the first man\r\n      changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted something loudly to a\r\n      comrade farther back. Rostóv paused. “No, there’s some mistake,” thought\r\n      he. “They can’t have wanted to kill me.” But at the same time, his left\r\n      arm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could\r\n      run no more. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostóv closed his\r\n      eyes and stooped down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He\r\n      mustered his last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his\r\n      right, and reached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian\r\n      sharpshooters."

    "text": "The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of\r\n      the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and\r\n      retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the\r\n      senseless cry, “Cut off!” that is so terrible in battle, and that word\r\n      infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.\n“Surrounded! Cut off? We’re lost!” shouted the fugitives.\nThe moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general\r\n      realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the\r\n      thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years’ service who had never\r\n      been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or\r\n      inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry\r\n      colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above all quite forgetting the\r\n      danger and all regard for self-preservation, he clutched the crupper of\r\n      his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail\r\n      of bullets which fell around, but fortunately missed him. His one desire\r\n      was to know what was happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the\r\n      mistake if he had made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty-two\r\n      years’ service, who had never been censured, should not be held to blame.\nHaving galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind the\r\n      copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and\r\n      descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides the\r\n      fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers\r\n      attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him,\r\n      continue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so\r\n      terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance distorted\r\n      out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of his saber,\r\n      the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the air, and\r\n      disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles\r\n      was evidently culminating in a panic.\nThe general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the\r\n      powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that\r\n      moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent\r\n      reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian\r\n      sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was Timókhin’s company,\r\n      which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having lain in\r\n      ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly. Timókhin, armed\r\n      only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and\r\n      such mad, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French had\r\n      thrown down their muskets and run. Dólokhov, running beside Timókhin,\r\n      killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the\r\n      surrendering French officer by his collar. Our fugitives returned, the\r\n      battalions re-formed, and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in\r\n      half were for the moment repulsed. Our reserve units were able to join up,\r\n      and the fight was at an end. The regimental commander and Major Ekonómov\r\n      had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies pass by\r\n      them, when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander’s stirrup,\r\n      almost leaning against him. The man was wearing a bluish coat of\r\n      broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his\r\n      shoulder a French munition pouch was slung. He had an officer’s sword in\r\n      his hand. The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the\r\n      commander’s face, and his lips were smiling. Though the commander was\r\n      occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonómov, he could not help\r\n      taking notice of the soldier.\n“Your excellency, here are two trophies,” said Dólokhov, pointing to the\r\n      French sword and pouch. “I have taken an officer prisoner. I stopped the\r\n      company.” Dólokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt\r\n      sentences. “The whole company can bear witness. I beg you will remember\r\n      this, your excellency!”\n“All right, all right,” replied the commander, and turned to Major\r\n      Ekonómov.\nBut Dólokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his head,\r\n      pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.\n“A bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your excellency!”\n\nTúshin’s battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action\r\n      did Prince Bagratión, still hearing the cannonade in the center, send his\r\n      orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order the battery\r\n      to retire as quickly as possible. When the supports attached to Túshin’s\r\n      battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someone’s\r\n      order, the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the\r\n      French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the\r\n      effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns. On the\r\n      contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the French to suppose\r\n      that here—in the center—the main Russian forces were\r\n      concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on each\r\n      occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on\r\n      the hillock.\nSoon after Prince Bagratión had left him, Túshin had succeeded in setting\r\n      fire to Schön Grabern.\n“Look at them scurrying! It’s burning! Just see the smoke! Fine! Grand!\r\n      Look at the smoke, the smoke!” exclaimed the artillerymen, brightening up.\nAll the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the\r\n      direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers\r\n      cried at each shot: “Fine! That’s good! Look at it... Grand!” The fire,\r\n      fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns that had\r\n      advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge for this\r\n      failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began\r\n      firing them at Túshin’s battery.\nIn their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in\r\n      successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this\r\n      battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one\r\n      knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon driver’s\r\n      leg. Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished, but only\r\n      changed character. The horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun\r\n      carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns were turned\r\n      against the ten-gun battery. Túshin’s companion officer had been killed at\r\n      the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty\r\n      men of the guns’ crews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were still\r\n      as merry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed the French appearing below\r\n      them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.\nLittle Túshin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to\r\n      “refill my pipe for that one!” and then, scattering sparks from it, ran\r\n      forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.\n“Smack at ‘em, lads!” he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheels and\r\n      working the screws himself.\nAmid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him\r\n      jump, Túshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun, now\r\n      aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing dead\r\n      or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his feeble\r\n      voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and more\r\n      animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away\r\n      from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always the case,\r\n      hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers, for the most\r\n      part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery company,\r\n      a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer—all\r\n      looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation, and\r\n      the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs.\nOwing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and\r\n      activity, Túshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of\r\n      fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never\r\n      occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It\r\n      seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he had\r\n      first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner of the\r\n      field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he thought of\r\n      everything, considered everything, and did everything the best of officers\r\n      could do in his position, he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or\r\n      drunkenness.\nFrom the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and thud\r\n      of the enemy’s cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces of the\r\n      crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and\r\n      horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy’s side (always\r\n      followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a\r\n      horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own\r\n      had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him\r\n      pleasure. The enemy’s guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which\r\n      occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.\n“There... he’s puffing again,” muttered Túshin to himself, as a small\r\n      cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the\r\n      wind.\n“Now look out for the ball... we’ll throw it back.”\n“What do you want, your honor?” asked an artilleryman, standing close by,\r\n      who heard him muttering.\n“Nothing... only a shell...” he answered.\n“Come along, our Matvévna!” he said to himself. “Matvévna” * was the name\r\n      his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which was large and of\r\n      an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns seemed to him like\r\n      ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One of the second gun’s\r\n      crew was “uncle”; Túshin looked at him more often than at anyone else and\r\n      took delight in his every movement. The sound of musketry at the foot of\r\n      the hill, now diminishing, now increasing, seemed like someone’s\r\n      breathing. He listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds.\n* Daughter of Matthew.\n“Ah! Breathing again, breathing!” he muttered to himself.\nHe imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing\r\n      cannon balls at the French with both hands.\n“Now then, Matvévna, dear old lady, don’t let me down!” he was saying as\r\n      he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called above his\r\n      head: “Captain Túshin! Captain!”\nTúshin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned him\r\n      out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:\n“Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...”\n“Why are they down on me?” thought Túshin, looking in alarm at his\r\n      superior.\n“I... don’t...” he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap. “I...”\nBut the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon ball,\r\n      flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse. He\r\n      paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball\r\n      stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.\n“Retire! All to retire!” he shouted from a distance.\nThe soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same\r\n      order.\nIt was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space\r\n      where Túshin’s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken\r\n      leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses. Blood was\r\n      gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay several dead\r\n      men. One ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a\r\n      nervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought of being afraid\r\n      roused him again. “I cannot be afraid,” thought he, and dismounted slowly\r\n      among the guns. He delivered the order and did not leave the battery. He\r\n      decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his\r\n      presence. Together with Túshin, stepping across the bodies and under a\r\n      terrible fire from the French, he attended to the removal of the guns.\n“A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,” said an\r\n      artilleryman to Prince Andrew. “Not like your honor!”\nPrince Andrew said nothing to Túshin. They were both so busy as to seem\r\n      not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon\r\n      that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill\r\n      (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode\r\n      up to Túshin.\n“Well, till we meet again...” he said, holding out his hand to Túshin.\n“Good-by, my dear fellow,” said Túshin. “Dear soul! Good-by, my dear\r\n      fellow!” and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes."

    "text": "The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke, hung\r\n      low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing dark and the\r\n      glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The cannonade was\r\n      dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded\r\n      oftener and nearer. As soon as Túshin with his guns, continually driving\r\n      round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range of fire and had\r\n      descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff, among them the\r\n      staff officer and Zherkóv, who had been twice sent to Túshin’s battery but\r\n      had never reached it. Interrupting one another, they all gave, and\r\n      transmitted, orders as to how to proceed, reprimanding and reproaching\r\n      him. Túshin gave no orders, and, silently—fearing to speak because\r\n      at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why—rode behind\r\n      on his artillery nag. Though the orders were to abandon the wounded, many\r\n      of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun\r\n      carriages. The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had\r\n      rushed out of Túshin’s wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach,\r\n      on “Matvévna’s” carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet,\r\n      supporting one hand with the other, came up to Túshin and asked for a\r\n      seat.\n“Captain, for God’s sake! I’ve hurt my arm,” he said timidly. “For God’s\r\n      sake... I can’t walk. For God’s sake!”\nIt was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and\r\n      been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.\n“Tell them to give me a seat, for God’s sake!”\n“Give him a seat,” said Túshin. “Lay a cloak for him to sit on, lad,” he\r\n      said, addressing his favorite soldier. “And where is the wounded officer?”\n“He has been set down. He died,” replied someone.\n“Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,\r\n      Antónov.”\nThe cadet was Rostóv. With one hand he supported the other; he was pale\r\n      and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on “Matvévna,”\r\n       the gun from which they had removed the dead officer. The cloak they\r\n      spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm.\n“What, are you wounded, my lad?” said Túshin, approaching the gun on which\r\n      Rostóv sat.\n“No, it’s a sprain.”\n“Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?” inquired Túshin.\n“It was the officer, your honor, stained it,” answered the artilleryman,\r\n      wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if apologizing for the\r\n      state of his gun.\nIt was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the\r\n      infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It\r\n      had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces\r\n      off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the right,\r\n      shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in the\r\n      darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers who had\r\n      sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of the village again,\r\n      but Túshin’s guns could not move, and the artillerymen, Túshin, and the\r\n      cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate. The firing died\r\n      down and soldiers, talking eagerly, streamed out of a side street.\n“Not hurt, Petróv?” asked one.\n“We’ve given it ‘em hot, mate! They won’t make another push now,” said\r\n      another.\n“You couldn’t see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows! Nothing\r\n      could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn’t there something to drink?”\nThe French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in the\r\n      complete darkness Túshin’s guns moved forward, surrounded by the humming\r\n      infantry as by a frame.\nIn the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing\r\n      always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of\r\n      hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the\r\n      wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of\r\n      the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans,\r\n      which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night. After a\r\n      while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on a white horse\r\n      followed by his suite, and said something in passing: “What did he say?\r\n      Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?” came eager questions from\r\n      all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a\r\n      report spread that they were ordered to halt: evidently those in front had\r\n      halted. All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road.\nFires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain Túshin,\r\n      having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing\r\n      station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers\r\n      had kindled on the road. Rostóv, too, dragged himself to the fire. From\r\n      pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole body.\r\n      Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by an\r\n      excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory\r\n      position. He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire,\r\n      which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered\r\n      figure of Túshin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him.\r\n      Túshin’s large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and\r\n      commiseration on Rostóv, who saw that Túshin with his whole heart wished\r\n      to help him but could not.\nFrom all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who were\r\n      walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound of voices,\r\n      the tramping feet, the horses’ hoofs moving in mud, the crackling of wood\r\n      fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.\nIt was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the\r\n      gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.\r\n      Rostóv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around\r\n      him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held his\r\n      hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.\n“You don’t mind your honor?” he asked Túshin. “I’ve lost my company, your\r\n      honor. I don’t know where... such bad luck!”\nWith the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the\r\n      bonfire, and addressing Túshin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle\r\n      to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to the\r\n      campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying to\r\n      snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.\n“You picked it up?... I dare say! You’re very smart!” one of them shouted\r\n      hoarsely.\nThen a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band,\r\n      came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.\n“Must one die like a dog?” said he.\nTúshin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier ran\r\n      up, begging a little fire for the infantry.\n“A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow\r\n      countrymen. Thanks for the fire—we’ll return it with interest,” said\r\n      he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.\nNext came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed\r\n      by the fire. One of them stumbled.\n“Who the devil has put the logs on the road?” snarled he.\n“He’s dead—why carry him?” said another.\n“Shut up!”\nAnd they disappeared into the darkness with their load.\n“Still aching?” Túshin asked Rostóv in a whisper.\n“Yes.”\n“Your honor, you’re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,” said a\r\n      gunner, coming up to Túshin.\n“Coming, friend.”\nTúshin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, walked\r\n      away from the fire.\nNot far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared for\r\n      him, Prince Bagratión sat at dinner, talking with some commanding officers\r\n      who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with the half-closed\r\n      eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the general who had\r\n      served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a glass of vodka and\r\n      the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherkóv,\r\n      uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed\r\n      lips and feverishly glittering eyes.\nIn a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and the\r\n      accountant with the naïve face was feeling its texture, shaking his head\r\n      in perplexity—perhaps because the banner really interested him,\r\n      perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at a\r\n      dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut there was a\r\n      French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers\r\n      were flocking in to look at him. Prince Bagratión was thanking the\r\n      individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our\r\n      losses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was\r\n      informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn\r\n      from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the\r\n      French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had\r\n      broken up the French troops.\n“When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was disorganized,\r\n      I stopped in the road and thought: ‘I’ll let them come on and will meet\r\n      them with the fire of the whole battalion’—and that’s what I did.”\nThe general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed\r\n      to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps it\r\n      might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that\r\n      confusion what did or did not happen?\n“By the way, your excellency, I should inform you,” he continued—remembering\r\n      Dólokhov’s conversation with Kutúzov and his last interview with the\r\n      gentleman-ranker—“that Private Dólokhov, who was reduced to the\r\n      ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my presence and particularly\r\n      distinguished himself.”\n“I saw the Pávlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,” chimed in\r\n      Zherkóv, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all that\r\n      day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. “They broke up two\r\n      squares, your excellency.”\nSeveral of those present smiled at Zherkóv’s words, expecting one of his\r\n      usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory\r\n      of our arms and of the day’s work, they assumed a serious expression,\r\n      though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any\r\n      foundation. Prince Bagratión turned to the old colonel:\n“Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically: infantry,\r\n      cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were abandoned in the\r\n      center?” he inquired, searching with his eyes for someone. (Prince\r\n      Bagratión did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that all\r\n      the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action.) “I\r\n      think I sent you?” he added, turning to the staff officer on duty.\n“One was damaged,” answered the staff officer, “and the other I can’t\r\n      understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only just\r\n      left.... It is true that it was hot there,” he added, modestly.\nSomeone mentioned that Captain Túshin was bivouacking close to the village\r\n      and had already been sent for.\n“Oh, but you were there?” said Prince Bagratión, addressing Prince Andrew.\n“Of course, we only just missed one another,” said the staff officer, with\r\n      a smile to Bolkónski.\n“I had not the pleasure of seeing you,” said Prince Andrew, coldly and\r\n      abruptly.\nAll were silent. Túshin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly\r\n      from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the generals in\r\n      the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his\r\n      superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it.\r\n      Several of those present laughed.\n“How was it a gun was abandoned?” asked Bagratión, frowning, not so much\r\n      at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherkóv laughed\r\n      loudest.\nOnly now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt\r\n      and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present\r\n      themselves to Túshin in all their horror. He had been so excited that he\r\n      had not thought about it until that moment. The officers’ laughter\r\n      confused him still more. He stood before Bagratión with his lower jaw\r\n      trembling and was hardly able to mutter: “I don’t know... your\r\n      excellency... I had no men... your excellency.”\n“You might have taken some from the covering troops.”\nTúshin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that was\r\n      perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble,\r\n      and silently fixed his eyes on Bagratión as a schoolboy who has blundered\r\n      looks at an examiner.\nThe silence lasted some time. Prince Bagratión, apparently not wishing to\r\n      be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to intervene.\r\n      Prince Andrew looked at Túshin from under his brows and his fingers\r\n      twitched nervously.\n“Your excellency!” Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice,\r\n      “you were pleased to send me to Captain Túshin’s battery. I went there and\r\n      found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two guns smashed, and\r\n      no supports at all.”\nPrince Bagratión and Túshin looked with equal intentness at Bolkónski, who\r\n      spoke with suppressed agitation.\n“And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,” he\r\n      continued, “we owe today’s success chiefly to the action of that battery\r\n      and the heroic endurance of Captain Túshin and his company,” and without\r\n      awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.\nPrince Bagratión looked at Túshin, evidently reluctant to show distrust in\r\n      Bolkónski’s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it, bent\r\n      his head, and told Túshin that he could go. Prince Andrew went out with\r\n      him.\n“Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!” said Túshin.\nPrince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt sad\r\n      and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.\n\n“Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will all\r\n      this end?” thought Rostóv, looking at the changing shadows before him. The\r\n      pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible drowsiness\r\n      overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the impression of\r\n      those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical\r\n      pain. It was they, these soldiers—wounded and unwounded—it was\r\n      they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting the sinews and\r\n      scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To rid himself of\r\n      them he closed his eyes.\nFor a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things\r\n      appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand, Sónya’s\r\n      thin little shoulders, Natásha’s eyes and laughter, Denísov with his voice\r\n      and mustache, and Telyánin and all that affair with Telyánin and\r\n      Bogdánich. That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh\r\n      voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly,\r\n      incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one\r\n      direction. He tried to get away from them, but they would not for an\r\n      instant let his shoulder move a hair’s breadth. It would not ache—it\r\n      would be well—if only they did not pull it, but it was impossible to\r\n      get rid of them.\nHe opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less than\r\n      a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were\r\n      fluttering in that light. Túshin had not returned, the doctor had not\r\n      come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the\r\n      other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.\n“Nobody wants me!” thought Rostóv. “There is no one to help me or pity me.\r\n      Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.” He sighed and, doing\r\n      so, groaned involuntarily.\n“Eh, is anything hurting you?” asked the soldier, shaking his shirt out\r\n      over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added:\r\n      “What a lot of men have been crippled today—frightful!”\nRostóv did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes\r\n      fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm,\r\n      bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his healthy\r\n      body, and all the affection and care of his family. “And why did I come\r\n      here?” he wondered.\nNext day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of\r\n      Bagratión’s detachment was reunited to Kutúzov’s army."

    "text": "Prince Vasíli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans. Still\r\n      less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He was merely\r\n      a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a\r\n      habit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to\r\n      himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life, were constantly\r\n      shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the circumstances and persons\r\n      he met. Of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but\r\n      dozens, some only beginning to form themselves, some approaching\r\n      achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He did not, for\r\n      instance, say to himself: “This man now has influence, I must gain his\r\n      confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant.” Nor did\r\n      he say to himself: “Pierre is a rich man, I must entice him to marry my\r\n      daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles I need.” But when he came\r\n      across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man\r\n      could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince Vasíli took the\r\n      first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, become intimate\r\n      with him, and finally make his request.\nHe had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as\r\n      Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of\r\n      Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to\r\n      Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness, yet\r\n      with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing, Prince\r\n      Vasíli did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had he thought\r\n      out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such\r\n      unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below\r\n      him in social standing. Something always drew him toward those richer and\r\n      more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most\r\n      opportune moment for making use of people.\nPierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezúkhov and a rich man, felt\r\n      himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and\r\n      preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to sign\r\n      papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of which was\r\n      not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his estate near\r\n      Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know\r\n      of his existence but would now have been offended and grieved had he\r\n      chosen not to see them. These different people—businessmen,\r\n      relations, and acquaintances alike—were all disposed to treat the\r\n      young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner: they were all\r\n      evidently firmly convinced of Pierre’s noble qualities. He was always\r\n      hearing such words as: “With your remarkable kindness,” or,\r\n      “With your excellent heart,” “You are yourself so honorable,\r\n      Count,” or, “Were he as clever as you,” and so on, till he\r\n      began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary\r\n      intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to\r\n      him that he really was very kind and intelligent. Even people who had formerly\r\n      been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and\r\n      affectionate. The angry eldest princess, with the long waist and hair plastered\r\n      down like a doll’s, had come into Pierre’s room after the funeral.\r\n      With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about\r\n      their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him\r\n      for anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received, to\r\n      remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had\r\n      sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at these words.\r\n      Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre took her\r\n      hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for. From that day\r\n      the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a\r\n      striped scarf for him.\n“Do this for my sake,mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a great\r\n      deal from the deceased,” said Prince Vasíli to him, handing him a deed to\r\n      sign for the princess’ benefit.\nPrince Vasíli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw\r\n      this bone—a bill for thirty thousand rubles—to the poor\r\n      princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the\r\n      affair of the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the\r\n      princess grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate\r\n      to him, especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often\r\n      made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting\r\n      him.\nIt seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it would\r\n      have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could not but\r\n      believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had no time to\r\n      ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He was always busy\r\n      and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication. He felt as\r\n      though he were the center of some important and general movement; that\r\n      something was constantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he\r\n      would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he did this and that, all\r\n      would be well; and he did what was demanded of him, but still that happy\r\n      result always remained in the future.\nMore than anyone else, Prince Vasíli took possession of Pierre’s affairs\r\n      and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of Count\r\n      Bezúkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of a man\r\n      oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for pity’s\r\n      sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of his old\r\n      friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice of fate\r\n      and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in Moscow after\r\n      the death of Count Bezúkhov, he would call Pierre, or go to him himself,\r\n      and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance,\r\n      as if he were adding every time: “You know I am overwhelmed with business\r\n      and it is purely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you\r\n      also know quite well that what I propose is the only thing possible.”\n“Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,” said Prince Vasíli\r\n      one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre’s elbow, speaking as if he\r\n      were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not\r\n      now be altered. “We start tomorrow and I’m giving you a place in my\r\n      carriage. I am very glad. All our important business here is now settled,\r\n      and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is something I have received\r\n      from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and you have been entered in the\r\n      diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. The diplomatic\r\n      career now lies open before you.”\nNotwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words were\r\n      pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career, wished to\r\n      make some suggestion. But Prince Vasíli interrupted him in the special\r\n      deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech,\r\n      which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed.\n“Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience, and\r\n      there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of being\r\n      too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it up tomorrow.\r\n      But you will see everything for yourself when you get to Petersburg. It is\r\n      high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections.” Prince\r\n      Vasíli sighed. “Yes, yes, my boy. And my valet can go in your carriage.\r\n      Ah! I was nearly forgetting,” he added. “You know,mon cher, your father\r\n      and I had some accounts to settle, so I have received what was due from\r\n      the Ryazán estate and will keep it; you won’t require it. We’ll go into\r\n      the accounts later.”\nBy “what was due from the Ryazán estate” Prince Vasíli meant several\r\n      thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre’s peasants, which the prince\r\n      had retained for himself.\nIn Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of\r\n      gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the rank\r\n      (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasíli had procured for him, and\r\n      acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous that,\r\n      even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle, and\r\n      continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never\r\n      attained.\nOf his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.\r\n      The Guards had gone to the front; Dólokhov had been reduced to the ranks;\r\n      Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew was\r\n      abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used\r\n      to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend\r\n      older than himself and whom he respected. His whole time was taken up with\r\n      dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vasíli’s house in the\r\n      company of the stout princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter\r\n      Hélène.\nLike the others, Anna Pávlovna Schérer showed Pierre the change of\r\n      attitude toward him that had taken place in society.\nFormerly in Anna Pávlovna’s presence, Pierre had always felt that what he\r\n      was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that remarks which\r\n      seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon\r\n      as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte’s stupidest remarks\r\n      came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said wascharmant. Even if\r\n      Anna Pávlovna did not say so, he could see that she wished to and only\r\n      refrained out of regard for his modesty.\nIn the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna\r\n      Pávlovna’s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added: “You\r\n      will find the beautiful Hélène here, whom it is always delightful to see.”\nWhen he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some link\r\n      which other people recognized had grown up between himself and Hélène, and\r\n      that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were being imposed on\r\n      him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an entertaining\r\n      supposition.\nAnna Pávlovna’s “At Home” was like the former one, only the novelty she\r\n      offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a diplomatist fresh\r\n      from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexander’s visit\r\n      to Potsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an\r\n      indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of\r\n      the human race. Anna Pávlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy,\r\n      evidently relating to the young man’s recent loss by the death of Count\r\n      Bezúkhov (everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that\r\n      he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known),\r\n      and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the\r\n      mention of her most august Majesty the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. Pierre\r\n      felt flattered by this. Anna Pávlovna arranged the different groups in her\r\n      drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were\r\n      Prince Vasíli and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat. Another\r\n      group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former, but Anna\r\n      Pávlovna—who was in the excited condition of a commander on a\r\n      battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there\r\n      is hardly time to put in action—seeing Pierre, touched his sleeve\r\n      with her finger, saying:\n“Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.” (She glanced\r\n      at Hélène and smiled at her.) “My dear Hélène, be charitable to my poor\r\n      aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for ten minutes. And that it\r\n      will not be too dull, here is the dear count who will not refuse to\r\n      accompany you.”\nThe beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pávlovna detained Pierre, looking as\r\n      if she had to give some final necessary instructions.\n“Isn’t she exquisite?” she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately beauty\r\n      as she glided away. “And how she carries herself! For so young a girl,\r\n      such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from her heart.\r\n      Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men would occupy\r\n      a most brilliant position in society. Don’t you think so? I only wanted to\r\n      know your opinion,” and Anna Pávlovna let Pierre go.\nPierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Hélène’s perfection of\r\n      manner. If he ever thought of Hélène, it was just of her beauty and her\r\n      remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society.\nThe old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed\r\n      desirous of hiding her adoration for Hélène and inclined rather to show\r\n      her fear of Anna Pávlovna. She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what\r\n      she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna Pávlovna again\r\n      touched Pierre’s sleeve, saying: “I hope you won’t say that it is dull in\r\n      my house again,” and she glanced at Hélène.\nHélène smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility\r\n      of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt coughed, swallowed,\r\n      and said in French that she was very pleased to see Hélène, then she\r\n      turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look. In the\r\n      middle of a dull and halting conversation, Hélène turned to Pierre with\r\n      the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone. Pierre was so used\r\n      to that smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that he paid no\r\n      attention to it. The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes\r\n      that had belonged to Pierre’s father, Count Bezúkhov, and showed them her\r\n      own box. Princess Hélène asked to see the portrait of the aunt’s husband\r\n      on the box lid.\n“That is probably the work of Vinesse,” said Pierre, mentioning a\r\n      celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox\r\n      while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.\nHe half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox,\r\n      passing it across Hélène’s back. Hélène stooped forward to make room, and\r\n      looked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening parties, wearing\r\n      a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at front and back. Her\r\n      bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre, was so close to him\r\n      that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her\r\n      neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that he need only have bent his\r\n      head a little to have touched them. He was conscious of the warmth of her\r\n      body, the scent of perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she moved.\r\n      He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress,\r\n      but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments. And having\r\n      once seen this he could not help being aware of it, just as we cannot\r\n      renew an illusion we have once seen through.\n“So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?” Hélène seemed to\r\n      say. “You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who may\r\n      belong to anyone—to you too,” said her glance. And at that moment\r\n      Pierre felt that Hélène not only could, but must, be his wife, and that it\r\n      could not be otherwise.\nHe knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the\r\n      altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not\r\n      even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why, that\r\n      it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.\nPierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see\r\n      her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every day\r\n      until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more than a\r\n      man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and\r\n      taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once\r\n      recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him. She\r\n      already had power over him, and between them there was no longer any\r\n      barrier except the barrier of his own will.\n“Well, I will leave you in your little corner,” came Anna Pávlovna’s\r\n      voice, “I see you are all right there.”\nAnd Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything\r\n      reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone\r\n      knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.\nA little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pávlovna said to\r\n      him: “I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?”\nThis was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and\r\n      Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house done\r\n      up.\n“That’s a good thing, but don’t move from Prince Vasíli’s. It is good to\r\n      have a friend like the prince,” she said, smiling at Prince Vasíli. “I\r\n      know something about that. Don’t I? And you are still so young. You need\r\n      advice. Don’t be angry with me for exercising an old woman’s privilege.”\nShe paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have\r\n      mentioned their age. “If you marry it will be a different thing,” she\r\n      continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at Hélène\r\n      nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He muttered\r\n      something and colored.\nWhen he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what\r\n      had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that\r\n      the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned\r\n      he had said absent-mindedly: “Yes, she’s good looking,” he had understood\r\n      that this woman might belong to him.\n“But she’s stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,” he thought. “There\r\n      is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites in me. I\r\n      have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she with\r\n      him, that there was quite a scandal and that that’s why he was sent away.\r\n      Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vasíli is her father... It’s bad....”\r\n       he reflected, but while he was thinking this (the reflection was still\r\n      incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line\r\n      of thought had sprung up, and while thinking of her worthlessness he was\r\n      also dreaming of how she would be his wife, how she would love him become\r\n      quite different, and how all he had thought and heard of her might be\r\n      false. And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vasíli, but\r\n      visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress. “But no! Why did\r\n      this thought never occur to me before?” and again he told himself that it\r\n      was impossible, that there would be something unnatural, and as it seemed\r\n      to him dishonorable, in this marriage. He recalled her former words and\r\n      looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together. He\r\n      recalled Anna Pávlovna’s words and looks when she spoke to him about his\r\n      house, recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vasíli and others, and\r\n      was seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do\r\n      something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at the\r\n      very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another part of\r\n      his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER II",
    "text": "In November, 1805, Prince Vasíli had to go on a tour of inspection in four\r\n      different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to visit his\r\n      neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where his\r\n      regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolkónski in\r\n      order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man.\r\n      But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs, Prince Vasíli\r\n      had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent\r\n      whole days at home, that is, in Prince Vasíli’s house where he was\r\n      staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in Hélène’s presence\r\n      (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed to her.\n“This is all very fine, but things must be settled,” said Prince Vasíli to\r\n      himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre who was\r\n      under such obligations to him (“But never mind that”) was not behaving\r\n      very well in this matter. “Youth, frivolity... well, God be with him,”\r\n       thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart, “but it must be brought\r\n      to a head. The day after tomorrow will be Lëlya’s name day. I will invite\r\n      two or three people, and if he does not understand what he ought to do\r\n      then it will be my affair—yes, my affair. I am her father.”\nSix weeks after Anna Pávlovna’s “At Home” and after the sleepless night\r\n      when he had decided that to marry Hélène would be a calamity and that he\r\n      ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision, had not\r\n      left Prince Vasíli’s and felt with terror that in people’s eyes he was\r\n      every day more and more connected with her, that it was impossible for him\r\n      to return to his former conception of her, that he could not break away\r\n      from her, and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to\r\n      unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have been able to free himself\r\n      but that Prince Vasíli (who had rarely before given receptions) now hardly\r\n      let a day go by without having an evening party at which Pierre had to be\r\n      present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint\r\n      everyone’s expectation. Prince Vasíli, in the rare moments when he was at\r\n      home, would take Pierre’s hand in passing and draw it downwards, or\r\n      absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to\r\n      kiss and would say: “Till tomorrow,” or, “Be in to dinner or I shall not\r\n      see you,” or, “I am staying in for your sake,” and so on. And though\r\n      Prince Vasíli, when he stayed in (as he said) for Pierre’s sake, hardly\r\n      exchanged a couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint\r\n      him. Every day he said to himself one and the same thing: “It is time I\r\n      understood her and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken\r\n      before, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent\r\n      girl,” he sometimes said to himself “she never makes a mistake, never says\r\n      anything stupid. She says little, but what she does say is always clear\r\n      and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was abashed and is not abashed\r\n      now, so she cannot be a bad woman!” He had often begun to make reflections\r\n      or think aloud in her company, and she had always answered him either by a\r\n      brief but appropriate remark—showing that it did not interest her—or\r\n      by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed\r\n      Pierre her superiority. She was right in regarding all arguments as\r\n      nonsense in comparison with that smile.\nShe always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him\r\n      alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general\r\n      smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was\r\n      waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that\r\n      sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror\r\n      seized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during\r\n      that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to\r\n      that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: “What am I doing? I need\r\n      resolution. Can it be that I have none?”\nHe wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter he\r\n      lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really\r\n      possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel\r\n      themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered by a\r\n      feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna Pávlovna’s, an\r\n      unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will.\nOn Hélène’s name day, a small party of just their own people—as his\r\n      wife said—met for supper at Prince Vasíli’s. All these friends and\r\n      relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl\r\n      would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper.\r\n      Princess Kurágina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome, was\r\n      sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the more\r\n      important guests—an old general and his wife, and Anna Pávlovna\r\n      Schérer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests, and\r\n      there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and Hélène, side by\r\n      side. Prince Vasíli was not having any supper: he went round the table in\r\n      a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of the guests. To\r\n      each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre\r\n      and Hélène, whose presence he seemed not to notice. He enlivened the whole\r\n      party. The wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so\r\n      did the ladies’ toilets and the gold and silver of the men’s epaulets;\r\n      servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, the clatter of plates,\r\n      knives, and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several\r\n      conversations. At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was heard\r\n      assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately, at which she\r\n      laughed; at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some\r\n      Mary Víktorovna or other. At the center of the table, Prince Vasíli\r\n      attracted everybody’s attention. With a facetious smile on his face, he\r\n      was telling the ladies about last Wednesday’s meeting of the Imperial\r\n      Council, at which Sergéy Kuzmích Vyazmítinov, the new military governor\r\n      general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous rescript of\r\n      the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergéy Kuzmích, in which the\r\n      Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the\r\n      people’s loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular\r\n      pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and\r\n      would endeavor to be worthy of it. This rescript began with the words:\r\n      “Sergéy Kuzmích, From all sides reports reach me,” etc.\n“Well, and so he never got farther than: ‘Sergéy Kuzmích’?” asked one of\r\n      the ladies.\n“Exactly, not a hair’s breadth farther,” answered Prince Vasíli, laughing,\r\n      “‘Sergéy Kuzmích... From all sides... From all sides... Sergéy Kuzmích...’\r\n      Poor Vyazmítinov could not get any farther! He began the rescript again\r\n      and again, but as soon as he uttered‘Sergéy’he sobbed,‘Kuz-mí-ch,’tears, and‘From all sides’was smothered in sobs and he could get no\r\n      farther. And again his handkerchief, and again:‘Sergéy Kuzmích, From all\r\n      sides,’... and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.”\n“Kuzmích... From all sides... and then tears,” someone repeated laughing.\n“Don’t be unkind,” cried Anna Pávlovna from her end of the table holding\r\n      up a threatening finger. “He is such a worthy and excellent man, our dear\r\n      Vyazmítinov....”\nEverybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the\r\n      honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the\r\n      influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and Hélène sat\r\n      silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a suppressed\r\n      smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing to do with\r\n      Sergéy Kuzmích—a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings. But\r\n      much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much as they enjoyed\r\n      their Rhine wine,sauté, and ices, and however they avoided looking at the\r\n      young couple, and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them, one\r\n      could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about Sergéy\r\n      Kuzmích, the laughter, and the food were all a pretense, and that the\r\n      whole attention of that company was directed to—Pierre and Hélène.\r\n      Prince Vasíli mimicked the sobbing of Sergéy Kuzmích and at the same time\r\n      his eyes glanced toward his daughter, and while he laughed the expression\r\n      on his face clearly said: “Yes... it’s getting on, it will all be settled\r\n      today.” Anna Pávlovna threatened him on behalf of “our dear Vyazmítinov,”\r\n       and in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vasíli\r\n      read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughter’s\r\n      happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the\r\n      old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh\r\n      seemed to say: “Yes, there’s nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet\r\n      wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus\r\n      boldly, provocatively happy.” “And what nonsense all this is that I am\r\n      saying!” thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces of the lovers.\r\n      “That’s happiness!”\nInto the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that\r\n      society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and\r\n      handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling\r\n      dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter.\r\n      Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was evidently\r\n      forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed\r\n      to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful\r\n      Hélène with her radiant face and at the red, broad, and happy though\r\n      uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light of the candles was\r\n      focused on those two happy faces alone.\nPierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and\r\n      embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.\r\n      He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and then\r\n      detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly\r\n      through his mind.\n“So it is all finished!” he thought. “And how has it all happened? How\r\n      quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself alone,\r\n      but because of everyone,itmust inevitably come about. They are all\r\n      expectingit, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I\r\n      cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it will\r\n      certainly happen!” thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling shoulders\r\n      close to his eyes.\nOr he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it awkward\r\n      to attract everyone’s attention and to be considered a lucky man and, with\r\n      his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris possessed of a Helen.\r\n      “But no doubt it always is and must be so!” he consoled himself. “And\r\n      besides, what have I done to bring it about? How did it begin? I traveled\r\n      from Moscow with Prince Vasíli. Then there was nothing. So why should I\r\n      not stay at his house? Then I played cards with her and picked up her\r\n      reticule and drove out with her. How did it begin, when did it all come\r\n      about?” And here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing,\r\n      hearing, feeling her nearness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty.\r\n      Then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so\r\n      unusually beautiful, and that that was why they all looked so at him, and\r\n      flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest, raise his\r\n      head, and rejoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice\r\n      repeating something to him a second time. But Pierre was so absorbed that\r\n      he did not understand what was said.\n“I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkónski,” repeated Prince\r\n      Vasíli a third time. “How absent-minded you are, my dear fellow.”\nPrince Vasíli smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him\r\n      and Hélène. “Well, what of it, if you all know it?” thought Pierre. “What\r\n      of it? It’s the truth!” and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile,\r\n      and Hélène smiled too.\n“When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmütz?” repeated Prince Vasíli,\r\n      who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute.\n“How can one talk or think of such trifles?” thought Pierre.\n“Yes, from Olmütz,” he answered, with a sigh.\nAfter supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing\r\n      room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave of Hélène.\r\n      Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation, came\r\n      up to her for a moment and made haste to go away, refusing to let her see\r\n      them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the\r\n      drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in\r\n      comparison with Pierre’s happiness. The old general grumbled at his wife\r\n      when she asked how his leg was. “Oh, the old fool,” he thought. “That\r\n      Princess Hélène will be beautiful still when she’s fifty.”\n“I think I may congratulate you,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to the old\r\n      princess, kissing her soundly. “If I hadn’t this headache I’d have stayed\r\n      longer.”\nThe old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her\r\n      daughter’s happiness.\nWhile the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time\r\n      alone with Hélène in the little drawing room where they were sitting. He\r\n      had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, but\r\n      had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable, but\r\n      he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt ashamed; he\r\n      felt that he was occupying someone else’s place here beside Hélène. “This\r\n      happiness is not for you,” some inner voice whispered to him. “This\r\n      happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you.”\nBut, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was\r\n      satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that this\r\n      name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.\nSome of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in the\r\n      large drawing room. Prince Vasíli came up to Pierre with languid\r\n      footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vasíli gave\r\n      him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was so\r\n      strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of severity\r\n      changed, and he drew Pierre’s hand downwards, made him sit down, and\r\n      smiled affectionately.\n“Well, Lëlya?” he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and addressing\r\n      her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who\r\n      have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince Vasíli had only\r\n      acquired by imitating other parents.\nAnd he again turned to Pierre.\n“Sergéy Kuzmích—From all sides—” he said,\r\n      unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat.\nPierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story\r\n      about Sergéy Kuzmích that interested Prince Vasíli just then, and Prince\r\n      Vasíli saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered something and went\r\n      away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted. The sight\r\n      of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched Pierre: he looked\r\n      at Hélène and she too seemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to say:\r\n      “Well, it is your own fault.”\n“The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!” thought Pierre, and he\r\n      again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergéy Kuzmích,\r\n      asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly.\r\n      Hélène answered with a smile that she too had missed it.\nWhen Prince Vasíli returned to the drawing room, the princess, his wife,\r\n      was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.\n“Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...”\n“Marriages are made in heaven,” replied the elderly lady.\nPrince Vasíli passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down on a\r\n      sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to be\r\n      dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.\n“Aline,” he said to his wife, “go and see what they are about.”\nThe princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and\r\n      indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and\r\n      Hélène still sat talking just as before.\n“Still the same,” she said to her husband.\nPrince Vasíli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his\r\n      face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking\r\n      himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went past\r\n      the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went joyfully\r\n      up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre rose in\r\n      alarm on seeing it.\n“Thank God!” said Prince Vasíli. “My wife has told me everything!” (He put\r\n      one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.)—“My dear\r\n      boy... Lëlya... I am very pleased.” (His voice trembled.) “I loved your\r\n      father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!...”\nHe embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his\r\n      malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.\n“Princess, come here!” he shouted.\nThe old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using her\r\n      handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful Hélène’s\r\n      hand several times. After a while they were left alone again.\n“All this had to be and could not be otherwise,” thought Pierre, “so it is\r\n      useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because it’s definite\r\n      and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.” Pierre held the hand of his\r\n      betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell.\n“Hélène!” he said aloud and paused.\n“Something special is always said in such cases,” he thought, but could\r\n      not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face. She drew\r\n      nearer to him. Her face flushed.\n“Oh, take those off... those...” she said, pointing to his spectacles.\nPierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have\r\n      from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and\r\n      inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but with\r\n      a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his lips and\r\n      met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,\r\n      unpleasantly excited expression.\n“It is too late now, it’s done; besides I love her,” thought Pierre.\n“Je vous aime!”* he said, remembering what has to be said at such\r\n      moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.\n* “I love you.”\nSix weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezúkhov’s large,\r\n      newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people said, of\r\n      a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER III",
    "text": "Old Prince Nicholas Bolkónski received a letter from Prince Vasíli in\r\n      November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him a\r\n      visit. “I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall\r\n      think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same\r\n      time, my honored benefactor,” wrote Prince Vasíli. “My son Anatole is\r\n      accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will allow him\r\n      personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his father, he\r\n      feels for you.”\n“It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are coming\r\n      to us of their own accord,” incautiously remarked the little princess on\r\n      hearing the news.\nPrince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.\nA fortnight after the letter Prince Vasíli’s servants came one evening in\r\n      advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.\nOld Bolkónski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasíli’s character,\r\n      but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and Alexander Prince\r\n      Vasíli had risen to high position and honors. And now, from the hints\r\n      contained in his letter and given by the little princess, he saw which way\r\n      the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into a feeling of\r\n      contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned him. On the day of\r\n      Prince Vasíli’s arrival, Prince Bolkónski was particularly discontented\r\n      and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasíli\r\n      was coming, or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially\r\n      annoyed at Prince Vasíli’s visit, he was in a bad temper, and in the\r\n      morning Tíkhon had already advised the architect not to go to the prince\r\n      with his report.\n“Do you hear how he’s walking?” said Tíkhon, drawing the architect’s\r\n      attention to the sound of the prince’s footsteps. “Stepping flat on his\r\n      heels—we know what that means....”\nHowever, at nine o’clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable\r\n      collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day before\r\n      and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the habit of\r\n      walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still visible in the\r\n      snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that\r\n      bordered both sides of the path. The prince went through the\r\n      conservatories, the serfs’ quarters, and the outbuildings, frowning and\r\n      silent.\n“Can a sleigh pass?” he asked his overseer, a venerable man, resembling\r\n      his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him back to the\r\n      house.\n“The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.”\nThe prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. “God be thanked,”\r\n       thought the overseer, “the storm has blown over!”\n“It would have been hard to drive up, your honor,” he added. “I heard,\r\n      your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.”\nThe prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,\r\n      frowning.\n“What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?” he said in his shrill,\r\n      harsh voice. “The road is not swept for the princess my daughter, but for\r\n      a minister! For me, there are no ministers!”\n“Your honor, I thought...”\n“You thought!” shouted the prince, his words coming more and more rapidly\r\n      and indistinctly. “You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!... I’ll teach you\r\n      to think!” and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit Alpátych,\r\n      the overseer, had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow.\r\n      “Thought... Blackguards...” shouted the prince rapidly.\nBut although Alpátych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the\r\n      stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before him,\r\n      or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued to shout:\r\n      “Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!” did not lift his stick\r\n      again but hurried into the house.\nBefore dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew that the\r\n      prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle Bourienne with\r\n      a radiant face that said: “I know nothing, I am the same as usual,” and\r\n      Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast eyes. What she found\r\n      hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to behave\r\n      like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not. She thought: “If I seem not to\r\n      notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him; if I seem sad and\r\n      out of spirits myself, he will say (as he has done before) that I’m in the\r\n      dumps.”\nThe prince looked at his daughter’s frightened face and snorted.\n“Fool... or dummy!” he muttered.\n“And the other one is not here. They’ve been telling tales,” he\r\n      thought—referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room.\n“Where is the princess?” he asked. “Hiding?”\n“She is not very well,” answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright\r\n      smile, “so she won’t come down. It is natural in her state.”\n“Hm! Hm!” muttered the prince, sitting down.\nHis plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he flung\r\n      it away. Tíkhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little princess\r\n      was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that,\r\n      hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.\n“I am afraid for the baby,” she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:\r\n      “Heaven knows what a fright might do.”\nIn general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and\r\n      with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize\r\n      because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince reciprocated\r\n      this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt for her. When the\r\n      little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills, she took a\r\n      special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked\r\n      her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her about the old prince\r\n      and criticized him.\n“So we are to have visitors,mon prince?” remarked Mademoiselle Bourienne,\r\n      unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. “His Excellency Prince\r\n      Vasíli Kurágin and his son, I understand?” she said inquiringly.\n“Hm!—his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the\r\n      service,” said the prince disdainfully. “Why his son is coming I don’t\r\n      understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know. I don’t\r\n      want him.” (He looked at his blushing daughter.) “Are you unwell today?\r\n      Eh? Afraid of the ‘minister’ as that idiot Alpátych called him this\r\n      morning?”\n“No,mon père.”\nThough Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a\r\n      subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the conservatories\r\n      and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and after the soup the\r\n      prince became more genial.\nAfter dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess was\r\n      sitting at a small table, chattering with Másha, her maid. She grew pale\r\n      on seeing her father-in-law.\nShe was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks had\r\n      sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.\n“Yes, I feel a kind of oppression,” she said in reply to the prince’s\r\n      question as to how she felt.\n“Do you want anything?”\n“No,merci, mon père.”\n“Well, all right, all right.”\nHe left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpátych stood with\r\n      bowed head.\n“Has the snow been shoveled back?”\n“Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven’s sake... It was only my\r\n      stupidity.”\n“All right, all right,” interrupted the prince, and laughing his unnatural\r\n      way, he stretched out his hand for Alpátych to kiss, and then proceeded to\r\n      his study.\nPrince Vasíli arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by coachmen\r\n      and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to one of the\r\n      lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.\nPrince Vasíli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.\nAnatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a\r\n      table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his\r\n      large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round\r\n      of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him. And he\r\n      looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in\r\n      the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well and\r\n      amusingly. “And why not marry her if she really has so much money? That\r\n      never does any harm,” thought Anatole.\nHe shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become\r\n      habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his father’s\r\n      room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to him. Prince\r\n      Vasíli’s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round with much\r\n      animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered, as if to\r\n      say: “Yes, that’s how I want you to look.”\n“I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?” Anatole asked, as if\r\n      continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned\r\n      during the journey.\n“Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious with\r\n      the old prince.”\n“If he starts a row I’ll go away,” said Prince Anatole. “I can’t bear\r\n      those old men! Eh?”\n“Remember, for you everything depends on this.”\nIn the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants’ rooms that the\r\n      minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had been\r\n      minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room, vainly\r\n      trying to master her agitation.\n“Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never happen!”\r\n       she said, looking at herself in the glass. “How shall I enter the drawing\r\n      room? Even if I like him I can’t now be myself with him.” The mere thought\r\n      of her father’s look filled her with terror. The little princess and\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received from Másha, the lady’s maid,\r\n      the necessary report of how handsome the minister’s son was, with his rosy\r\n      cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty the father had dragged\r\n      his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle, three\r\n      steps at a time. Having received this information, the little princess and\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose chattering voices had reached her from the\r\n      corridor, went into Princess Mary’s room.\n“You know they’ve come, Marie?” said the little princess,\r\n      waddling in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.\nShe was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning, but\r\n      had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her face\r\n      was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded\r\n      outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still\r\n      more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch\r\n      had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne’s toilet which rendered her fresh\r\n      and pretty face yet more attractive.\n“What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?” she began.\r\n      “They’ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we\r\n      shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!”\nThe little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily\r\n      began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be\r\n      dressed. Princess Mary’s self-esteem was wounded by the fact that the\r\n      arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both her\r\n      companions’ not having the least conception that it could be otherwise. To\r\n      tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to\r\n      betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to dress her would\r\n      prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew\r\n      dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive\r\n      martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she submitted herself to\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these womenquite sincerelytried to\r\n      make her look pretty. She was so plain that neither of them could think of\r\n      her as a rival, so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity, and\r\n      with the naïve and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face\r\n      pretty.\n“No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,” said Lise, looking\r\n      sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. “You have a maroon\r\n      dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may\r\n      be at stake. But this one is too light, it’s not becoming!”\nIt was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that\r\n      was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess\r\n      felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the\r\n      hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best\r\n      maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that the\r\n      frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that however they\r\n      might change the setting and adornment of that face, it would still remain\r\n      piteous and plain. After two or three changes to which Princess Mary\r\n      meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her\r\n      head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks) and she had put on\r\n      a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the little princess walked twice\r\n      round her, now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand, now\r\n      arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one\r\n      side and then on the other.\n“No, it will not do,” she said decidedly, clasping her hands.\r\n      “No, Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little\r\n      gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,” she said to the\r\n      maid, “bring the princess her gray dress, and you’ll see, Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,” she added, smiling with a foretaste of\r\n      artistic pleasure.\nBut when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained sitting\r\n      motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the mirror\r\n      her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst into sobs.\n“Come, dear princess,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, “just one\r\n      more little effort.”\nThe little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess\r\n      Mary.\n“Well, now we’ll arrange something quite simple and becoming,” she said.\nThe three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s, and Katie’s, who was\r\n      laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping of\r\n      birds.\n“No, leave me alone,” said Princess Mary.\nHer voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was\r\n      silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful eyes\r\n      full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at them,\r\n      and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.\n“At least, change your coiffure,” said the little princess. “Didn’t I tell\r\n      you,” she went on, turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne,\r\n      “Mary’s is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least. Not in\r\n      the least! Please change it.”\n“Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to me,”\r\n       answered a voice struggling with tears.\nMademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves\r\n      that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual, but\r\n      it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they both\r\n      knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess Mary\r\n      did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they knew\r\n      that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to be\r\n      shaken in her determination.\n“You will change it, won’t you?” said Lise. And as Princess\r\n      Mary gave no answer, she left the room.\nPrincess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise’s request, she\r\n      not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her glass.\r\n      Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and pondered.\r\n      A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in\r\n      her imagination, and carried her into a totally different happy world of\r\n      his own. She fancied a child,her own—such as she had seen the day\r\n      before in the arms of her nurse’s daughter—at her own breast, the\r\n      husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child. “But no, it\r\n      is impossible, I am too ugly,” she thought.\n“Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,” came the maid’s\r\n      voice at the door.\nShe roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and\r\n      before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her\r\n      eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a lamp,\r\n      she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful doubt\r\n      filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, be for\r\n      her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of\r\n      children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing was for earthly\r\n      love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from\r\n      herself, the stronger it grew. “O God,” she said, “how am I to stifle in\r\n      my heart these temptations of the devil? How am I to renounce forever\r\n      these vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?” And scarcely\r\n      had she put that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart.\r\n      “Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious or envious.\r\n      Man’s future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee, but live so\r\n      that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be God’s will to prove thee\r\n      in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill His will.” With this\r\n      consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her\r\n      forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed\r\n      herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how\r\n      she would go in nor of what she would say. What could all that matter in\r\n      comparison with the will of God, without Whose care not a hair of man’s\r\n      head can fall?"

    "text": "When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasíli and his son were already in\r\n      the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels,\r\n      the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess,\r\n      indicating her to the gentlemen, said:“Voilà Marie!”Princess Mary saw\r\n      them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasíli’s face, serious for\r\n      an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and the\r\n      little princess curiously noting the impression “Marie” produced on the\r\n      visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty\r\n      face, and her unusually animated look which was fixed onhim, buthimshe\r\n      could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome\r\n      moving toward her as she entered the room. Prince Vasíli approached first,\r\n      and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his\r\n      question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well.\r\n      Then Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a\r\n      soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white\r\n      forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade.\r\n      When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood with\r\n      his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded and his\r\n      back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a little\r\n      bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and\r\n      evidently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor\r\n      ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable\r\n      in society, of composure and imperturbable self-possession. If a man\r\n      lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and\r\n      betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety\r\n      to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung\r\n      his foot, and smilingly examined the princess’ hair. It was evident that\r\n      he could be silent in this way for a very long time. “If anyone finds this\r\n      silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don’t want to,” he seemed to\r\n      say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which\r\n      particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love—a\r\n      supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said to\r\n      them: “I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? You’d be\r\n      only too glad, of course.” Perhaps he did not really think this when he\r\n      met women—even probably he did not, for in general he thought very\r\n      little—but his looks and manner gave that impression. The princess\r\n      felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect\r\n      to interest him, she turned to his father. The conversation was general\r\n      and animated, thanks to Princess Lise’s voice and little downy lip that\r\n      lifted over her white teeth. She met Prince Vasíli with that playful\r\n      manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the\r\n      assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there\r\n      are some semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences,\r\n      though no such reminiscences really exist—just as none existed in\r\n      this case. Prince Vasíli readily adopted her tone and the little princess\r\n      also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections\r\n      of things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them\r\n      and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these\r\n      merry reminiscences.\n“Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves,\r\n      dear prince,” said the little princess (of course, in French) to Prince\r\n      Vasíli. “It’s not as at Annette’s * receptions where you\r\n      always ran away; you remembercette chère Annette!”\n* Anna Pávlovna.\n“Ah, but you won’t talk politics to me like Annette!”\n“And our little tea table?”\n“Oh, yes!”\n“Why is it you were never at Annette’s?” the little princess asked\r\n      Anatole. “Ah, I know, I know,” she said with a sly glance, “your brother\r\n      Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!” and she shook her finger at\r\n      him, “I have even heard of your doings in Paris!”\n“And didn’t Hippolyte tell you?” asked Prince Vasíli, turning to his son\r\n      and seizing the little princess’ arm as if she would have run away and he\r\n      had just managed to catch her, “didn’t he tell you how he himself was\r\n      pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she is\r\n      a pearl among women, Princess,” he added, turning to Princess Mary.\nWhen Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the\r\n      opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.\nShe took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had\r\n      left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the\r\n      Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her\r\n      about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole\r\n      came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either. “Not\r\n      at all bad!” he thought, examining her, “not at all bad, that little\r\n      companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we’re married,la\r\n      petite est gentille.” *\n* The little one is charming.\nThe old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering\r\n      what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. “What are\r\n      Prince Vasíli and that son of his to me? Prince Vasíli is a shallow\r\n      braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,” he grumbled to\r\n      himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in\r\n      his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which\r\n      he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring\r\n      himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince\r\n      never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he\r\n      would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his\r\n      feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess\r\n      Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. “And why\r\n      should she marry?” he thought. “To be unhappy for certain. There’s Lise,\r\n      married to Andrew—a better husband one would think could hardly be\r\n      found nowadays—but is she contented with her lot? And who would\r\n      marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They’ll take her for her\r\n      connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even the\r\n      happier for it?” So thought Prince Bolkónski while dressing, and yet the\r\n      question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer. Prince\r\n      Vasíli had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and\r\n      today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer. His birth and\r\n      position in society were not bad. “Well, I’ve nothing against it,” the\r\n      prince said to himself, “but he must be worthy of her. And that is what we\r\n      shall see.”\n“That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!” he added aloud.\nHe entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly\r\n      round the company. He noticed the change in the little princess’ dress,\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne’s ribbon, Princess Mary’s unbecoming coiffure,\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne’s and Anatole’s smiles, and the loneliness of his\r\n      daughter amid the general conversation. “Got herself up like a fool!” he\r\n      thought, looking irritably at her. “She is shameless, and he ignores her!”\nHe went straight up to Prince Vasíli.\n“Well! How d’ye do? How d’ye do? Glad to see you!”\n“Friendship laughs at distance,” began Prince Vasíli in his usual rapid,\r\n      self-confident, familiar tone. “Here is my second son; please love and\r\n      befriend him.”\nPrince Bolkónski surveyed Anatole.\n“Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!” he said. “Well, come\r\n      and kiss me,” and he offered his cheek.\nAnatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect\r\n      composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told\r\n      him to expect.\nPrince Bolkónski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa\r\n      and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasíli, pointed to it and began\r\n      questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen\r\n      attentively to what Prince Vasíli said, but kept glancing at Princess\r\n      Mary.\n“And so they are writing from Potsdam already?” he said, repeating Prince\r\n      Vasíli’s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.\n“Is it for visitors you’ve got yourself up like that, eh?” said\r\n      he. “Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the\r\n      visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to\r\n      dare to change your way of dress without my consent.”\n“It was my fault,mon père,” interceded the little princess, with a blush.\n“You must do as you please,” said Prince Bolkónski, bowing to his\r\n      daughter-in-law, “but she need not make a fool of herself, she’s plain\r\n      enough as it is.”\nAnd he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was\r\n      reduced to tears.\n“On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,” said Prince\r\n      Vasíli.\n“Now you, young prince, what’s your name?” said Prince Bolkónski,\r\n      turning to Anatole, “come here, let us talk and get acquainted.”\n“Now the fun begins,” thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside\r\n      the old prince.\n“Well, my dear boy, I hear you’ve been educated abroad, not taught to read\r\n      and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear\r\n      boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?” asked the old man, scrutinizing\r\n      Anatole closely and intently.\n“No, I have been transferred to the line,” said Anatole, hardly able to\r\n      restrain his laughter.\n“Ah! That’s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and\r\n      the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you\r\n      off to the front?”\n“No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what\r\n      is it I am attached to, Papa?” said Anatole, turning to his father with a\r\n      laugh.\n“A splendid soldier, splendid! ‘What am I attached to!’ Ha, ha,\r\n      ha!” laughed Prince Bolkónski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly\r\n      Prince Bolkónski frowned.\n“You may go,” he said to Anatole.\nAnatole returned smiling to the ladies.\n“And so you’ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vasíli, haven’t\r\n      you?” said the old prince to Prince Vasíli.\n“I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is\r\n      much better than ours.”\n“Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad’s a\r\n      fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.” He took Prince\r\n      Vasíli’s arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were alone\r\n      together, Prince Vasíli announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince.\n“Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can’t part from\r\n      her?” said the old prince angrily. “What an idea! I’m ready\r\n      for it tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You\r\n      know my principles—everything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in your\r\n      presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and I’ll\r\n      see.” The old prince snorted. “Let her marry, it’s all the same\r\n      to me!” he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son.\n“I will tell you frankly,” said Prince Vasíli in the tone of a crafty man\r\n      convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen-sighted a\r\n      companion. “You know, you see right through people. Anatole is no genius,\r\n      but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or kinsman.”\n“All right, all right, we’ll see!”\nAs always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time\r\n      without male society, on Anatole’s appearance all the three women of\r\n      Prince Bolkónski’s household felt that their life had not been real till\r\n      then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately\r\n      increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in\r\n      darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.\nPrincess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The\r\n      handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed\r\n      all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and\r\n      magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future\r\n      family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and\r\n      tried to conceal them.\n“But am I not too cold with him?” thought the princess. “I try\r\n      to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already,\r\n      but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do not\r\n      like him.”\nAnd Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new\r\n      guest. “Poor girl, she’s devilish ugly!” thought Anatole.\nMademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole’s\r\n      arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman\r\n      without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did\r\n      not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolkónski, to reading\r\n      aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne\r\n      had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a\r\n      glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian\r\n      princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her off; and here at\r\n      last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from\r\n      her aunt but finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to\r\n      herself. It was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her\r\n      poor mother (sa pauvre mère) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to\r\n      a man without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to\r\n      tears as in imagination she told this story tohim, her seducer. And nowhe, a real Russian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away and thensa pauvre mèrewould appear and he would marry her. So her future shaped\r\n      itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne’s head at the very time she was talking\r\n      to Anatole about Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did\r\n      not even for a moment consider what she should do), but all this had long\r\n      been familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped\r\n      itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as\r\n      possible.\nThe little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,\r\n      unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the\r\n      familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any struggle,\r\n      but with naïve and lighthearted gaiety.\nAlthough in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired\r\n      of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of\r\n      his power over these three women. Besides that, he was beginning to feel\r\n      for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate\r\n      animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and\r\n      prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.\nAfter tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was\r\n      asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits,\r\n      came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.\r\n      Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the\r\n      look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But Anatole’s\r\n      expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to\r\n      the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne’s little foot, which he was then\r\n      touching with his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was\r\n      also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of\r\n      fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.\n“How she loves me!” thought Princess Mary. “How happy I am now,\r\n      and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? Can it be\r\n      possible?” she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling\r\n      his eyes gazing at her.\nIn the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole\r\n      kissed Princess Mary’s hand. She did not know how she found the courage,\r\n      but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her\r\n      shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne’s hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did\r\n      everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne\r\n      flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.\n“What delicacy!” thought the princess. “Is it possible that\r\n      Amélie” (Mademoiselle Bourienne) “thinks I could be jealous of her,\r\n      and not value her pure affection and devotion to me?” She went up to her\r\n      and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess’ hand.\n“No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well\r\n      I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!” she said. And smilingly\r\n      raising a finger at him, she left the room."

    "text": "They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got\r\n      into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.\n“Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind—yes,\r\n      kind, that is the chief thing,” thought Princess Mary; and fear, which she\r\n      had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it seemed\r\n      to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark\r\n      corner. And this someone washe—the devil—andhewas\r\n      also this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.\nShe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.\nMademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time\r\n      that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now\r\n      working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of herpauvre mèrerebuking her for her fall.\nThe little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made. She\r\n      could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was\r\n      awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than ever\r\n      because Anatole’s presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she\r\n      was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She sat in an\r\n      armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and\r\n      disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time,\r\n      muttering to herself.\n“I told you it was all lumps and holes!” the little princess repeated.\r\n      “I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it’s not my fault!”\r\n      and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.\nThe old prince did not sleep either. Tíkhon, half asleep, heard him pacing\r\n      angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he had been\r\n      insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed because it\r\n      concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than\r\n      himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter\r\n      and decide what was right and how he should act, but instead of that he\r\n      only excited himself more and more.\n“The first man that turns up—she forgets her father and everything\r\n      else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike\r\n      herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice it.\r\n      Fr... fr... fr! And don’t I see that that idiot had eyes only for\r\n      Bourienne—I shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not\r\n      pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at least\r\n      have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing\r\n      of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but I’ll let\r\n      her see....”\nThe old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake\r\n      and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess\r\n      Mary’s self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to be parted from\r\n      her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this thought, he called\r\n      Tíkhon and began to undress.\n“What devil brought them here?” thought he, while Tíkhon was putting the\r\n      nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. “I never\r\n      invited them. They came to disturb my life—and there is not much of\r\n      it left.”\n“Devil take ‘em!” he muttered, while his head was still\r\n      covered by the shirt.\nTíkhon knew his master’s habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and therefore\r\n      met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face\r\n      that emerged from the shirt.\n“Gone to bed?” asked the prince.\nTíkhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his\r\n      master’s thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince Vasíli\r\n      and his son.\n“They have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.”\n“No good... no good...” said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet\r\n      into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he\r\n      went to the couch on which he slept.\nThough no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne,\r\n      they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance,\r\n      up to the appearance of thepauvre mère; they understood that they had\r\n      much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an\r\n      opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary\r\n      went to her father’s room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and\r\n      Anatole met in the conservatory.\nPrincess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation. It\r\n      seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be\r\n      decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She\r\n      read this in Tíkhon’s face and in that of Prince Vasíli’s valet,\r\n      who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water.\nThe old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his\r\n      daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression\r\n      of her father’s. His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched\r\n      with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic, when rising\r\n      from his chair he would walk away from her, repeating in a low voice the\r\n      same words several times over.\nHe came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.\n“I have had a proposition made me concerning you,” he said with an\r\n      unnatural smile. “I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasíli has not\r\n      come and brought his pupil with him” (for some reason Prince Bolkónski\r\n      referred to Anatole as a “pupil”) “for the sake of my beautiful\r\n      eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you know my\r\n      principles, I refer it to you.”\n“How am I to understand you,mon père?” said the princess,\r\n      growing pale and then blushing.\n“How understand me!” cried her father angrily. “Prince Vasíli\r\n      finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you on his\r\n      pupil’s behalf. That’s how it’s to be understood! ‘How\r\n      understand it’!... And I ask you!”\n“I do not know what you think, Father,” whispered the princess.\n“I? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I’m not going to get\r\n      married. What aboutyou?That’s what I want to know.”\nThe princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval, but\r\n      at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided\r\n      now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which\r\n      she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to submit from\r\n      habit, and she said: “I wish only to do your will, but if I had to express\r\n      my own desire...” She had no time to finish. The old prince interrupted\r\n      her.\n“That’s admirable!” he shouted. “He will take you with your dowry and take\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She’ll be the wife, while you...”\nThe prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his\r\n      daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.\n“Now then, now then, I’m only joking!” he said. “Remember\r\n      this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose.\r\n      I give you freedom. Only remember that your life’s happiness depends on your\r\n      decision. Never mind me!”\n“But I do not know, Father!”\n“There’s no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you or\r\n      anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it over,\r\n      and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no. I know\r\n      you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had betterthinkit\r\n      over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!” he still shouted when the\r\n      princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the study.\nHer fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said\r\n      about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but\r\n      still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was\r\n      going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing\r\n      anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw Anatole\r\n      embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With a\r\n      horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess\r\n      Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne who had not yet seen her.\n“Who’s that? Why? Wait a moment!” Anatole’s face seemed to say. Princess\r\n      Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At last\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to\r\n      Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at\r\n      this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door\r\n      that led to his own apartments.\nAn hour later, Tíkhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince; he\r\n      added that Prince Vasíli was also there. When Tíkhon came to her Princess\r\n      Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The princess’\r\n      beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with\r\n      tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne’s pretty face.\n“No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!” said Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne.\n“Why? I love you more than ever,” said Princess Mary, “and I will try to\r\n      do all I can for your happiness.”\n“But you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so\r\n      carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...”\n“I quite understand,” answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile. “Calm\r\n      yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,” she said, and went out.\nPrince Vasíli, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in\r\n      his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face, as\r\n      if stirred to his heart’s core and himself regretting and laughing at his\r\n      own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a pinch of\r\n      snuff.\n“Ah, my dear, my dear!” he began, rising and taking her by both hands.\r\n      Then, sighing, he added: “My son’s fate is in your hands. Decide, my dear,\r\n      good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a daughter!”\nHe drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.\n“Fr... fr...” snorted Prince Bolkónski. “The prince is making a\r\n      proposition to you in his pupil’s—I mean, his son’s—name. Do\r\n      you wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kurágin’s wife? Reply: yes or no,” he\r\n      shouted, “and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also.\r\n      Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,” added Prince Bolkónski, turning to\r\n      Prince Vasíli and answering his imploring look. “Yes, or no?”\n“My desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my life from\r\n      yours. I don’t wish to marry,” she answered positively, glancing at Prince\r\n      Vasíli and at her father with her beautiful eyes.\n“Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!” cried Prince Bolkónski,\r\n      frowning and taking his daughter’s hand; he did not kiss her, but only\r\n      bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so that\r\n      she winced and uttered a cry.\nPrince Vasíli rose.\n“My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never\r\n      forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this\r\n      heart, so kind and generous? Say ‘perhaps’... The future is so long. Say\r\n      ‘perhaps.’”\n“Prince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for the\r\n      honor, but I shall never be your son’s wife.”\n“Well, so that’s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have seen\r\n      you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!” said the old prince.\r\n      “Very, very glad to have seen you,” repeated he, embracing Prince Vasíli.\n“My vocation is a different one,” thought Princess Mary. “My vocation is\r\n      to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of love and\r\n      self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Amélie’s\r\n      happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately repents. I\r\n      will do all I can to arrange the match between them. If he is not rich I\r\n      will give her the means; I will ask my father and Andrew. I shall be so\r\n      happy when she is his wife. She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone,\r\n      helpless! And, oh God, how passionately she must love him if she could so\r\n      far forget herself! Perhaps I might have done the same!...” thought\r\n      Princess Mary."

    "text": "It was long since the Rostóvs had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter was\r\n      the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son’s handwriting. On\r\n      receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste, trying to\r\n      escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the letter.\nAnna Mikháylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house, on\r\n      hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found\r\n      the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same time.\nAnna Mikháylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still living\r\n      with the Rostóvs.\n“My dear friend?” said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared to\r\n      sympathize in any way.\nThe count sobbed yet more.\n“Nikólenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling boy... the\r\n      countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How tell the little\r\n      countess!”\nAnna Mikháylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped the\r\n      tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her own eyes\r\n      she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till teatime she\r\n      would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God’s help, would inform\r\n      her.\nAt dinner Anna Mikháylovna talked the whole time about the war news and\r\n      about Nikólenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received from\r\n      him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might very\r\n      likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these hints\r\n      began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count\r\n      and at Anna Mikháylovna, the latter very adroitly turned the conversation\r\n      to insignificant matters. Natásha, who, of the whole family, was the most\r\n      gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation, look, and\r\n      expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was\r\n      certain that there was some secret between her father and Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna, that it had something to do with her brother, and that Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as she was, Natásha, who knew\r\n      how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nikólenka, did not\r\n      venture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat\r\n      anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her\r\n      governess’ remarks. After dinner, she rushed headlong after Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon as she\r\n      overtook her in the sitting room.\n“Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!”\n“Nothing, my dear.”\n“No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won’t give up—I know you know\r\n      something.”\nAnna Mikháylovna shook her head.\n“You are a little slyboots,” she said.\n“A letter from Nikólenka! I’m sure of it!” exclaimed Natásha, reading\r\n      confirmation in Anna Mikháylovna’s face.\n“But for God’s sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your mamma.”\n“I will, I will, only tell me! You won’t? Then I will go and tell at\r\n      once.”\nAnna Mikháylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter, on\r\n      condition that she should tell no one.\n“No, on my true word of honor,” said Natásha, crossing herself, “I won’t\r\n      tell anyone!” and she ran off at once to Sónya.\n“Nikólenka... wounded... a letter,” she announced in gleeful triumph.\n“Nicholas!”was all Sónya said, instantly turning white.\nNatásha, seeing the impression the news of her brother’s wound produced on\r\n      Sónya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news.\nShe rushed to Sónya, hugged her, and began to cry.\n“A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he wrote\r\n      himself,” said she through her tears.\n“There now! It’s true that all you women are crybabies,” remarked Pétya,\r\n      pacing the room with large, resolute strides. “Now I’m very glad, very\r\n      glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so. You are all\r\n      blubberers and understand nothing.”\nNatásha smiled through her tears.\n“You haven’t read the letter?” asked Sónya.\n“No, but she said that it was all over and that he’s now an officer.”\n“Thank God!” said Sónya, crossing herself. “But perhaps she\r\n      deceived you. Let us go to Mamma.”\nPétya paced the room in silence for a time.\n“If I’d been in Nikólenka’s place I would have killed even more of those\r\n      Frenchmen,” he said. “What nasty brutes they are! I’d have killed so many\r\n      that there’d have been a heap of them.”\n“Hold your tongue, Pétya, what a goose you are!”\n“I’m not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,” said Pétya.\n“Do you remember him?” Natásha suddenly asked, after a moment’s silence.\nSónya smiled.\n“Do I rememberNicholas?”\n“No, Sónya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly,\r\n      remember everything?” said Natásha, with an expressive gesture, evidently\r\n      wishing to give her words a very definite meaning. “I remember Nikólenka\r\n      too, I remember him well,” she said. “But I don’t remember\r\n      Borís. I don’t remember him a bit.”\n“What! You don’t remember Borís?” asked Sónya in surprise.\n“It’s not that I don’t remember—I know what he is like,\r\n      but not as I remember Nikólenka. Him—I just shut my eyes and remember, but\r\n      Borís... No!” (She shut her eyes.) “No! there’s nothing at all.”\n“Oh, Natásha!” said Sónya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her\r\n      friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say\r\n      and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking was out of\r\n      the question, “I am in love with your brother once for all and, whatever\r\n      may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him as long as I\r\n      live.”\nNatásha looked at Sónya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said\r\n      nothing. She felt that Sónya was speaking the truth, that there was such\r\n      love as Sónya was speaking of. But Natásha had not yet felt anything like\r\n      it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.\n“Shall you write to him?” she asked.\nSónya became thoughtful. The question of how to write toNicholas, and\r\n      whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an\r\n      officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself\r\n      and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?\n“I don’t know. I think if he writes, I will write too,” she said,\r\n      blushing.\n“And you won’t feel ashamed to write to him?”\nSónya smiled.\n“No.”\n“And I should be ashamed to write to Borís. I’m not going to.”\n“Why should you be ashamed?”\n“Well, I don’t know. It’s awkward and would make me ashamed.”\n“And I know why she’d be ashamed,” said Pétya, offended by Natásha’s\r\n      previous remark. “It’s because she was in love with that fat one in\r\n      spectacles” (that was how Pétya described his namesake, the new Count\r\n      Bezúkhov) “and now she’s in love with that singer” (he meant Natásha’s\r\n      Italian singing master), “that’s why she’s ashamed!”\n“Pétya, you’re stupid!” said Natásha.\n“Not more stupid than you, madam,” said the nine-year-old Pétya, with the\r\n      air of an old brigadier.\nThe countess had been prepared by Anna Mikháylovna’s hints at dinner. On\r\n      retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a\r\n      miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears\r\n      kept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikháylovna, with the letter, came on\r\n      tiptoe to the countess’ door and paused.\n“Don’t come in,” she said to the old count who was following\r\n      her. “Come later.” And she went in, closing the door behind her.\nThe count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.\nAt first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna Mikháylovna’s\r\n      voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence, then both voices\r\n      together with glad intonations, and then footsteps. Anna Mikháylovna\r\n      opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has\r\n      just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate\r\n      his skill.\n“It is done!” she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the\r\n      countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and\r\n      in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.\nWhen she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his\r\n      bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait, and\r\n      in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away the\r\n      bald head. Véra, Natásha, Sónya, and Pétya now entered the room, and the\r\n      reading of the letter began. After a brief description of the campaign and\r\n      the two battles in which he had taken part, and his promotion, Nicholas\r\n      said that he kissed his father’s and mother’s hands asking for their\r\n      blessing, and that he kissed Véra, Natásha, and Pétya. Besides that, he\r\n      sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse,\r\n      and asked them to kiss for him “dear Sónya, whom he loved and thought of\r\n      just the same as ever.” When she heard this Sónya blushed so that tears\r\n      came into her eyes and, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away\r\n      into the dancing hall, whirled round it at full speed with her dress\r\n      puffed out like a balloon, and, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the\r\n      floor. The countess was crying.\n“Why are you crying, Mamma?” asked Véra. “From all he says\r\n      one should be glad and not cry.”\nThis was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natásha looked at\r\n      her reproachfully. “And who is it she takes after?” thought the countess.\nNicholas’ letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were\r\n      considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she did not\r\n      let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and Dmítri, and\r\n      several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter each time with\r\n      fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of Nikólenka’s\r\n      virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how joyful it seemed, that her\r\n      son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt\r\n      twenty years ago within her, that son about whom she used to have quarrels\r\n      with the too indulgent count, that son who had first learned to say “pear”\r\n       and then “granny,” that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid\r\n      strange surroundings, a manly warrior doing some kind of man’s work of his\r\n      own, without help or guidance. The universal experience of ages, showing\r\n      that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not\r\n      exist for the countess. Her son’s growth toward manhood, at each of its\r\n      stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed\r\n      the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty years\r\n      before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere\r\n      under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to speak, so\r\n      now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong,\r\n      brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this letter, he now\r\n      was.\n“What astyle!How charmingly he describes!” said she, reading the\r\n      descriptive part of the letter. “And what a soul! Not a word about\r\n      himself.... Not a word! About some Denísov or other, though he himself, I\r\n      dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about his\r\n      sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered\r\n      everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so high—I\r\n      always said....”\nFor more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of letters\r\n      to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out, while\r\n      under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count,\r\n      money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly\r\n      commissioned officer were collected. Anna Mikháylovna, practical woman\r\n      that she was, had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure\r\n      advantageous means of communication for herself and her son. She had\r\n      opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand Duke Constantine\r\n      Pávlovich, who commanded the Guards. The Rostóvs supposed thatThe Russian\r\n      Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address, and that if a letter reached\r\n      the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should\r\n      not reach the Pávlograd regiment, which was presumably somewhere in the\r\n      same neighborhood. And so it was decided to send the letters and money by\r\n      the Grand Duke’s courier to Borís and Borís was to forward them to\r\n      Nicholas. The letters were from the old count, the countess, Pétya, Véra,\r\n      Natásha, and Sónya, and finally there were six thousand rubles for his\r\n      outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER VII",
    "text": "On the twelfth of November, Kutúzov’s active army, in camp before Olmütz,\r\n      was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors—the\r\n      Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the\r\n      night ten miles from Olmütz and next morning were to come straight to the\r\n      review, reaching the field at Olmütz by ten o’clock.\nThat day Nicholas Rostóv received a letter from Borís, telling him that\r\n      the Ismáylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmütz\r\n      and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him. Rostóv\r\n      was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after their active\r\n      service, were stationed near Olmütz and the camp swarmed with\r\n      well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting\r\n      wares. The Pávlograds held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had\r\n      received for the campaign, and made expeditions to Olmütz to visit a\r\n      certain Caroline the Hungarian, who had recently opened a restaurant there\r\n      with girls as waitresses. Rostóv, who had just celebrated his promotion to\r\n      a cornetcy and bought Denísov’s horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to\r\n      his comrades and the sutlers. On receiving Borís’ letter he rode with a\r\n      fellow officer to Olmütz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then\r\n      set off alone to the Guards’ camp to find his old playmate. Rostóv had not\r\n      yet had time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket,\r\n      decorated with a soldier’s cross, equally shabby cadet’s riding breeches\r\n      lined with worn leather, and an officer’s saber with a sword knot. The Don\r\n      horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the\r\n      campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one\r\n      side of his head. As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would\r\n      impress Borís and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance—that\r\n      of a fighting hussar who had been under fire.\nThe Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading\r\n      their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their\r\n      knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided\r\n      excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments\r\n      had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand\r\n      Duke’s orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on which\r\n      the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their proper\r\n      posts. Borís had been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg\r\n      who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had obtained his\r\n      captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors\r\n      by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very\r\n      satisfactorily. Borís, during the campaign, had made the acquaintance of\r\n      many persons who might prove useful to him, and by a letter of\r\n      recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become acquainted with\r\n      Prince Andrew Bolkónski, through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the\r\n      commander in chief’s staff. Berg and Borís, having rested after\r\n      yesterday’s march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a round\r\n      table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess. Berg held a\r\n      smoking pipe between his knees. Borís, in the accurate way characteristic\r\n      of him, was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white\r\n      fingers while awaiting Berg’s move, and watched his opponent’s face,\r\n      evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he\r\n      was engaged on.\n“Well, how are you going to get out of that?” he remarked.\n“We’ll try to,” replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing his hand.\nAt that moment the door opened.\n“Here he is at last!” shouted Rostóv. “And Berg too! Oh, youpetisenfans, allay cushay dormir!” he exclaimed, imitating his Russian\r\n      nurse’s French, at which he and Borís used to laugh long ago.\n“Dear me, how you have changed!”\nBorís rose to meet Rostóv, but in doing so did not omit to steady and\r\n      replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his\r\n      friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth,\r\n      that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner\r\n      different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas\r\n      wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch\r\n      him, push him, do anything but kiss him—a thing everybody did. But\r\n      notwithstanding this, Borís embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and\r\n      kissed him three times.\nThey had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young\r\n      men take their first steps on life’s road, each saw immense changes in the\r\n      other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those\r\n      first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in\r\n      a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.\n“Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you’d been to a fete, not\r\n      like us sinners of the line,” cried Rostóv, with martial swagger and with\r\n      baritone notes in his voice, new to Borís, pointing to his own\r\n      mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rostóv’s loud\r\n      voice, popped her head in at the door.\n“Eh, is she pretty?” he asked with a wink.\n“Why do you shout so? You’ll frighten them!” said Borís.\r\n      “I did not expect you today,” he added. “I only sent you the\r\n      note yesterday by Bolkónski—an adjutant of Kutúzov’s, who’s a\r\n      friend of mine. I did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how\r\n      are you? Been under fire already?” asked Borís.\nWithout answering, Rostóv shook the soldier’s Cross of St. George fastened\r\n      to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm, glanced at\r\n      Berg with a smile.\n“As you see,” he said.\n“Indeed? Yes, yes!” said Borís, with a smile. “And we too have\r\n      had a splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode with\r\n      our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every\r\n      advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls! I\r\n      can’t tell you. And the Tsarévich was very gracious to all our officers.”\nAnd the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his hussar\r\n      revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures and\r\n      advantages of service under members of the Imperial family.\n“Oh, you Guards!” said Rostóv. “I say, send for some wine.”\nBorís made a grimace.\n“If you really want it,” said he.\nHe went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent for\r\n      wine.\n“Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,” he added.\nRostóv took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both arms\r\n      on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he glanced\r\n      angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the letter.\n“Well, they’ve sent you a tidy sum,” said Berg, eying the heavy purse that\r\n      sank into the sofa. “As for us, Count, we get along on our pay. I can tell\r\n      you for myself...”\n“I say, Berg, my dear fellow,” said Rostóv, “when you get a letter from\r\n      home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over\r\n      with, and I happen to be there, I’ll go at once, to be out of your way! Do\r\n      go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!” he exclaimed, and immediately\r\n      seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently\r\n      wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, “Don’t be hurt, my\r\n      dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance.”\n“Oh, don’t mention it, Count! I quite understand,” said Berg, getting up\r\n      and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.\n“Go across to our hosts: they invited you,” added Borís.\nBerg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust, stood\r\n      before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards, in the\r\n      way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having assured himself from\r\n      the way Rostóv looked at it that his coat had been noticed, left the room\r\n      with a pleasant smile.\n“Oh dear, what a beast I am!” muttered Rostóv, as he read the letter.\n“Why?”\n“Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them such a\r\n      fright! Oh, what a pig I am!” he repeated, flushing suddenly. “Well, have\r\n      you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let’s have some!”\nIn the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to\r\n      Bagratión which the old countess at Anna Mikháylovna’s advice had obtained\r\n      through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take it to its\r\n      destination and make use of it.\n“What nonsense! Much I need it!” said Rostóv, throwing the letter under\r\n      the table.\n“Why have you thrown that away?” asked Borís.\n“It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it for!”\n“Why ‘What the devil’?” said Borís, picking it up and\r\n      reading the address. “This letter would be of great use to you.”\n“I want nothing, and I won’t be anyone’s adjutant.”\n“Why not?” inquired Borís.\n“It’s a lackey’s job!”\n“You are still the same dreamer, I see,” remarked Borís, shaking his head.\n“And you’re still the same diplomatist! But that’s not the\r\n      point... Come, how are you?” asked Rostóv.\n“Well, as you see. So far everything’s all right, but I confess I should\r\n      much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.”\n“Why?”\n“Because when once a man starts on military service, he should try to make\r\n      as successful a career of it as possible.”\n“Oh, that’s it!” said Rostóv, evidently thinking of something else.\nHe looked intently and inquiringly into his friend’s eyes, evidently\r\n      trying in vain to find the answer to some question.\nOld Gabriel brought in the wine.\n“Shouldn’t we now send for Berg?” asked Borís. “He would\r\n      drink with you. I can’t.”\n“Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?” asked\r\n      Rostóv, with a contemptuous smile.\n“He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,” answered Borís.\nAgain Rostóv looked intently into Borís’ eyes and sighed. Berg returned,\r\n      and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became\r\n      animated. The Guardsmen told Rostóv of their march and how they had been\r\n      made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke of the sayings and\r\n      doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories of his\r\n      kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent when the subject\r\n      did not relate to himself, but in connection with the stories of the Grand\r\n      Duke’s quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to\r\n      deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and\r\n      was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement. With a pleasant smile Berg\r\n      related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion,\r\n      shouting: “Arnauts!” (“Arnauts” was the Tsarévich’s\r\n      favorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the company commander.\n“Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew I\r\n      was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army\r\n      Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord’s\r\n      Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and so my\r\n      conscience was at ease. I came forward....” (Berg stood up and showed how\r\n      he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it would have\r\n      been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self-complacency\r\n      than his did.) “Well, he stormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and\r\n      stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but rather of death, as\r\n      the saying is. ‘Albanians!’ and ‘devils!’ and ‘To Siberia!’” said Berg\r\n      with a sagacious smile. “I knew I was in the right so I kept silent; was\r\n      not that best, Count?... ‘Hey, are you dumb?’ he shouted. Still I remained\r\n      silent. And what do you think, Count? The next day it was not even\r\n      mentioned in the Orders of the Day. That’s what keeping one’s head means.\r\n      That’s the way, Count,” said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of\r\n      smoke.\n“Yes, that was fine,” said Rostóv, smiling.\nBut Borís noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and\r\n      skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where he\r\n      got his wound. This pleased Rostóv and he began talking about it, and as\r\n      he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his Schön\r\n      Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do\r\n      describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they have\r\n      heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it\r\n      really was. Rostóv was a truthful young man and would on no account have\r\n      told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to tell everything just\r\n      as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably he lapsed\r\n      into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his hearers—who like\r\n      himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea\r\n      of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story—they\r\n      would either not have believed him or, still worse, would have thought\r\n      that Rostóv was himself to blame since what generally happens to the\r\n      narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him. He could not tell\r\n      them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse\r\n      and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman\r\n      into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it would\r\n      have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened.\r\n      It is very difficult to tell the truth, and young people are rarely\r\n      capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all\r\n      aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his\r\n      way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted flesh and he had\r\n      fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he told them all that.\nIn the middle of his story, just as he was saying: “You cannot imagine\r\n      what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,” Prince Andrew,\r\n      whom Borís was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who liked to\r\n      help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being\r\n      well disposed toward Borís, who had managed to please him the day before,\r\n      he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent with papers\r\n      from Kutúzov to the Tsarévich, he looked in on Borís, hoping to find him\r\n      alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his\r\n      military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he\r\n      gave Borís a pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at\r\n      Rostóv, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the sofa: he\r\n      felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company. Rostóv flushed up on\r\n      noticing this, but he did not care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing,\r\n      however, at Borís, he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the\r\n      line.\nIn spite of Prince Andrew’s disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of the\r\n      contempt with which Rostóv, from hisfightingarmy point of view, regarded\r\n      all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently\r\n      one, Rostóv felt confused, blushed, and became silent. Borís inquired what\r\n      news there might be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one\r\n      might ask about our plans.\n“We shall probably advance,” replied Bolkónski, evidently reluctant to say\r\n      more in the presence of a stranger.\nBerg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was\r\n      rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be\r\n      doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could give no\r\n      opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed gaily.\n“As to your business,” Prince Andrew continued, addressing Borís, “we will\r\n      talk of it later” (and he looked round at Rostóv). “Come to me after the\r\n      review and we will do what is possible.”\nAnd, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rostóv, whose\r\n      state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did\r\n      not condescend to notice, and said: “I think you were talking of the Schön\r\n      Grabern affair? Were you there?”\n“I was there,” said Rostóv angrily, as if intending to insult the\r\n      aide-de-camp.\nBolkónski noticed the hussar’s state of mind, and it amused him. With a\r\n      slightly contemptuous smile, he said: “Yes, there are many stories now\r\n      told about that affair!”\n“Yes, stories!” repeated Rostóv loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown\r\n      furious, now at Borís, now at Bolkónski. “Yes, many stories! But our\r\n      stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy’s fire!Ourstories have some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the\r\n      staff who get rewards without doing anything!”\n“Of whom you imagine me to be one?” said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and\r\n      particularly amiable smile.\nA strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man’s\r\n      self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostóv’s soul.\n“I am not talking about you,” he said, “I don’t know you and, frankly, I\r\n      don’t want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.”\n“And I will tell you this,” Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet\r\n      authority, “you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with you that\r\n      it would be very easy to do so if you haven’t sufficient self-respect, but\r\n      admit that the time and place are very badly chosen. In a day or two we\r\n      shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and\r\n      besides, Drubetskóy, who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at all\r\n      to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you. However,” he\r\n      added rising, “you know my name and where to find me, but don’t forget\r\n      that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted,\r\n      and as a man older than you, my advice is to let the matter drop. Well\r\n      then, on Friday after the review I shall expect you, Drubetskóy.Au\r\n      revoir!” exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.\nOnly when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostóv think of what he ought to have\r\n      said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He ordered\r\n      his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Borís, rode home. Should he\r\n      go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant, or\r\n      really let the matter drop, was the question that worried him all the way.\r\n      He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of\r\n      that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol, and then he\r\n      felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so\r\n      much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated."

    "text": "The day after Rostóv had been to see Borís, a review was held of the\r\n      Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia and\r\n      those who had been campaigning under Kutúzov. The two Emperors, the\r\n      Russian with his heir the Tsarévich, and the Austrian with the Archduke,\r\n      inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.\nFrom early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up on\r\n      the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets moved\r\n      and halted at the officers’ command, turned with banners flying, formed up\r\n      at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in\r\n      different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the\r\n      jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with\r\n      smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses;\r\n      then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining\r\n      cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks,\r\n      came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took\r\n      up its appointed position. Not only the generals in full parade uniforms,\r\n      with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks\r\n      squeezed into their stiff collars, and wearing scarves and all their\r\n      decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier\r\n      with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished\r\n      to the utmost, and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and\r\n      every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth—felt that no small matter\r\n      was happening, but an important and solemn affair. Every general and every\r\n      soldier was conscious of his own insignificance, aware of being but a drop\r\n      in that ocean of men, and yet at the same time was conscious of his\r\n      strength as a part of that enormous whole.\nFrom early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten\r\n      o’clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn up on\r\n      the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the cavalry in\r\n      front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the infantry.\nA space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The three\r\n      parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutúzov’s fighting army\r\n      (with the Pávlograds on the right flank of the front); those recently\r\n      arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the line; and the\r\n      Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines, under one command,\r\n      and in a like order.\nLike wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: “They’re coming! They’re\r\n      coming!” Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final preparation swept\r\n      over all the troops.\nFrom the direction of Olmütz in front of them, a group was seen\r\n      approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust of\r\n      wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances\r\n      and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It looked as if\r\n      by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the\r\n      approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting: “Eyes front!”\r\n       Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by others\r\n      from various sides and all became silent.\nIn the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This was\r\n      the Emperors’ suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the trumpets\r\n      of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It seemed as\r\n      though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army itself,\r\n      rejoicing at the Emperors’ approach, had naturally burst into music. Amid\r\n      these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor Alexander was\r\n      clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the first regiment\r\n      roared “Hurrah!” so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men\r\n      themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power\r\n      they constituted.\nRostóv, standing in the front lines of Kutúzov’s army which the Tsar\r\n      approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in that\r\n      army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of might, and\r\n      a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph.\nHe felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he\r\n      himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water,\r\n      commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could\r\n      not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.\n“Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!” thundered from all sides, one regiment after\r\n      another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then\r\n      “Hurrah!”... Then the general march, and again “Hurrah! Hurrah!” growing\r\n      ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.\nTill the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility\r\n      seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive,\r\n      its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already\r\n      passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices, amid the\r\n      square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone,\r\n      hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically\r\n      and above all freely, and in front of them two men—the Emperors.\r\n      Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass\r\n      of men was concentrated.\nThe handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards,\r\n      wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his pleasant face\r\n      and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone’s attention.\nRostóv was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had\r\n      recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty\r\n      paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his\r\n      handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness and\r\n      ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every movement\r\n      of the Tsar’s seemed to him enchanting.\nStopping in front of the Pávlograds, the Tsar said something in French to\r\n      the Austrian Emperor and smiled.\nSeeing that smile, Rostóv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still\r\n      stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in\r\n      some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar\r\n      called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.\n“Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?” thought\r\n      Rostóv. “I should die of happiness!”\nThe Tsar addressed the officers also: “I thank you all, gentlemen, I thank\r\n      you with my whole heart.” To Rostóv every word sounded like a voice from\r\n      heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!\n“You have earned the St. George’s standards and will be worthy of them.”\n“Oh, to die, to die for him,” thought Rostóv.\nThe Tsar said something more which Rostóv did not hear, and the soldiers,\r\n      straining their lungs, shouted “Hurrah!”\nRostóv too, bending over his saddle, shouted “Hurrah!” with all his might,\r\n      feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to\r\n      express his rapture fully.\nThe Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.\n“How can the Emperor be undecided?” thought Rostóv, but then even this\r\n      indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything else\r\n      the Tsar did.\nThat hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar’s foot, in the narrow\r\n      pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare\r\n      he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he moved off\r\n      accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp. Farther and\r\n      farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at last only his\r\n      white plumes were visible to Rostóv from amid the suites that surrounded\r\n      the Emperors.\nAmong the gentlemen of the suite, Rostóv noticed Bolkónski, sitting his\r\n      horse indolently and carelessly. Rostóv recalled their quarrel of\r\n      yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not\r\n      to challenge Bolkónski. “Of course not!” he now thought. “Is it worth\r\n      thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such love, such\r\n      rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels and affronts\r\n      matter? I love and forgive everybody now.”\nWhen the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began a\r\n      ceremonial march past him, and Rostóv on Bedouin, recently purchased from\r\n      Denísov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron—that is, alone\r\n      and in full view of the Emperor.\nBefore he reached him, Rostóv, who was a splendid horseman, spurred\r\n      Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the\r\n      animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his\r\n      tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor’s eye upon\r\n      him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful action,\r\n      as if flying through the air without touching the ground.\nRostóv himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling\r\n      himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but\r\n      blissful face “like a vewy devil,” as Denísov expressed it.\n“Fine fellows, the Pávlograds!” remarked the Emperor.\n“My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this\r\n      instant!” thought Rostóv.\nWhen the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also Kutúzov’s,\r\n      collected in groups and began to talk about the awards, about the\r\n      Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about Bonaparte, and how\r\n      badly the latter would fare now, especially if the Essen corps arrived and\r\n      Prussia took our side.\nBut the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His\r\n      every word and movement was described with ecstasy.\nThey all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the\r\n      enemy under the Emperor’s command. Commanded by the Emperor himself they\r\n      could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought Rostóv\r\n      and most of the officers after the review.\nAll were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles\r\n      would have made them."

    "text": "The day after the review, Borís, in his best uniform and with his comrade\r\n      Berg’s best wishes for success, rode to Olmütz to see Bolkónski, wishing\r\n      to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he\r\n      could—preferably that of adjutant to some important personage, a\r\n      position in the army which seemed to him most attractive. “It is all very\r\n      well for Rostóv, whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time, to\r\n      talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone’s lackey,\r\n      but I who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not\r\n      miss opportunities, but must avail myself of them!” he reflected.\nHe did not find Prince Andrew in Olmütz that day, but the appearance of\r\n      the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed\r\n      and the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and courts\r\n      only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.\nHe knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman’s uniform, all these\r\n      exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with\r\n      their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military men, seemed\r\n      so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the Guards, that\r\n      they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be aware of his\r\n      existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief, Kutúzov, where he\r\n      inquired for Bolkónski, all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at\r\n      him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like\r\n      him were always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them.\r\n      In spite of this, or rather because of it, next day, November 15, after\r\n      dinner he again went to Olmütz and, entering the house occupied by\r\n      Kutúzov, asked for Bolkónski. Prince Andrew was in and Borís was shown\r\n      into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing, but in which five\r\n      beds now stood, and furniture of various kinds: a table, chairs, and a\r\n      clavichord. One adjutant, nearest the door, was sitting at the table in a\r\n      Persian dressing gown, writing. Another, the red, stout Nesvítski, lay on\r\n      a bed with his arms under his head, laughing with an officer who had sat\r\n      down beside him. A third was playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord,\r\n      while a fourth, lying on the clavichord, sang the tune. Bolkónski was not\r\n      there. None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Borís. The\r\n      one who was writing and whom Borís addressed turned round crossly and told\r\n      him Bolkónski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the\r\n      left into the reception room if he wished to see him. Borís thanked him\r\n      and went to the reception room, where he found some ten officers and\r\n      generals.\nWhen he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with\r\n      that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, “If it\r\n      were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment”), was listening to\r\n      an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very erect, almost on\r\n      tiptoe, with a soldier’s obsequious expression on his purple face,\r\n      reporting something.\n“Very well, then, be so good as to wait,” said Prince Andrew to the\r\n      general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected when\r\n      he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Borís, Prince Andrew,\r\n      paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear\r\n      something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile.\nAt that moment Borís clearly realized what he had before surmised, that in\r\n      the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the\r\n      military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was\r\n      another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced,\r\n      purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for\r\n      his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskóy. More than ever\r\n      was Borís resolved to serve in future not according to the written code,\r\n      but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having been\r\n      recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general who at\r\n      the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards.\r\n      Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.\n“I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about\r\n      with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.\r\n      When Germans start being accurate, there’s no end to it!”\nBorís smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to as\r\n      something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard\r\n      Weyrother’s name, or even the term “dispositions.”\n“Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have been\r\n      thinking about you.”\n“Yes, I was thinking”—for some reason Borís could not help blushing—“of\r\n      asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from Prince Kurágin\r\n      about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards won’t be in\r\n      action,” he added as if in apology.\n“All right, all right. We’ll talk it over,” replied Prince Andrew. “Only\r\n      let me report this gentleman’s business, and I shall be at your disposal.”\nWhile Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that\r\n      gentleman—evidently not sharing Borís’ conception of the advantages\r\n      of the unwritten code of subordination—looked so fixedly at the\r\n      presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say\r\n      to the adjutant that Borís felt uncomfortable. He turned away and waited\r\n      impatiently for Prince Andrew’s return from the commander in chief’s room.\n“You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,” said Prince\r\n      Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was.\r\n      “It’s no use your going to the commander in chief. He would say a lot of\r\n      pleasant things, ask you to dinner” (“That would not be bad as regards the\r\n      unwritten code,” thought Borís), “but nothing more would come of it. There\r\n      will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is\r\n      what we’ll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent\r\n      fellow, Prince Dolgorúkov; and though you may not know it, the fact is\r\n      that now Kutúzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing.\r\n      Everything is now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgorúkov;\r\n      I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We\r\n      shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you\r\n      somewhere nearer the sun.”\nPrince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young\r\n      man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help of this\r\n      kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for himself, he\r\n      kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted\r\n      him. He very readily took up Borís’ cause and went with him to Dolgorúkov.\nIt was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmütz occupied\r\n      by the Emperors and their retinues.\nThat same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of\r\n      the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary\r\n      to the views of the old generals Kutúzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it had\r\n      been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte. The\r\n      council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Borís\r\n      arrived at the palace to find Dolgorúkov. Everyone at headquarters was\r\n      still under the spell of the day’s council, at which the party of the\r\n      young had triumphed. The voices of those who counseled delay and advised\r\n      waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely\r\n      silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the\r\n      advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council—the\r\n      coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it—no\r\n      longer seemed to be in the future but in the past. All the advantages were\r\n      on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to Napoleon’s, were\r\n      concentrated in one place, the troops inspired by the Emperors’ presence\r\n      were eager for action. The strategic position where the operations would\r\n      take place was familiar in all its details to the Austrian General\r\n      Weyrother: a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian army should\r\n      maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the French had now to\r\n      be fought; the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on\r\n      the maps, and Bonaparte, evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.\nDolgorúkov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just returned\r\n      from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory\r\n      that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his protégé, but Prince\r\n      Dolgorúkov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Borís\r\n      and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his\r\n      mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew in French.\n“Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that the one\r\n      that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear fellow,” he\r\n      said abruptly and eagerly, “I must confess to having been unjust to the\r\n      Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What exactitude, what minuteness,\r\n      what knowledge of the locality, what foresight for every eventuality,\r\n      every possibility even to the smallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no\r\n      conditions better than our present ones could have been devised. This\r\n      combination of Austrian precision with Russian valor—what more could\r\n      be wished for?”\n“So the attack is definitely resolved on?” asked Bolkónski.\n“And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has\r\n      decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him\r\n      today for the Emperor.” Dolgorúkov smiled significantly.\n“Is that so? And what did he say?” inquired Bolkónski.\n“What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time. I tell\r\n      you he is in our hands, that’s certain! But what was most amusing,” he\r\n      continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, “was that we could not think\r\n      how to address the reply! If not as ‘Consul’ and of course not as\r\n      ‘Emperor,’ it seemed to me it should be to ‘General Bonaparte.’”\n“But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General\r\n      Bonaparte, there is a difference,” remarked Bolkónski.\n“That’s just it,” interrupted Dolgorúkov quickly, laughing. “You know\r\n      Bilíbin—he’s a very clever fellow. He suggested addressing him as\r\n      ‘Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.’”\nDolgorúkov laughed merrily.\n“Only that?” said Bolkónski.\n“All the same, it was Bilíbin who found a suitable form for the address.\r\n      He is a wise and clever fellow.”\n“What was it?”\n“To the Head of the French Government...Au chef du gouvernement\r\n      français,” said Dolgorúkov, with grave satisfaction. “Good, wasn’t it?”\n“Yes, but he will dislike it extremely,” said Bolkónski.\n“Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he’s dined with him—the\r\n      present Emperor—more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a\r\n      more cunning or subtle diplomatist—you know, a combination of French\r\n      adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and\r\n      Count Markóv? Count Markóv was the only man who knew how to handle him.\r\n      You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!”\nAnd the talkative Dolgorúkov, turning now to Borís, now to Prince Andrew,\r\n      told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markóv, our ambassador, purposely\r\n      dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at Markóv,\r\n      probably expecting Markóv to pick it up for him, and how Markóv\r\n      immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching\r\n      Bonaparte’s.\n“Delightful!” said Bolkónski. “But I have come to you, Prince, as a\r\n      petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...” but before Prince\r\n      Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dolgorúkov to the\r\n      Emperor.\n“Oh, what a nuisance,” said Dolgorúkov, getting up hurriedly and pressing\r\n      the hands of Prince Andrew and Borís. “You know I should be very glad to\r\n      do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man.” Again he\r\n      pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of good-natured,\r\n      sincere, and animated levity. “But you see... another time!”\nBorís was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as\r\n      he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here he was in\r\n      contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the\r\n      mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, obedient, and\r\n      insignificant atom. They followed Prince Dolgorúkov out into the corridor\r\n      and met—coming out of the door of the Emperor’s room by which\r\n      Dolgorúkov had entered—a short man in civilian clothes with a clever\r\n      face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling his face, gave him\r\n      a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression. This short man nodded to\r\n      Dolgorúkov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool\r\n      intensity, walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow\r\n      or to step out of his way. Prince Andrew did neither: a look of animosity\r\n      appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of\r\n      the corridor.\n“Who was that?” asked Borís.\n“He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of men—the\r\n      Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartorýski.... It is such men as\r\n      he who decide the fate of nations,” added Bolkónski with a sigh he could\r\n      not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.\nNext day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of\r\n      Austerlitz, Borís was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorúkov\r\n      again and remained for a while with the Ismáylov regiment."

Rostóv saw the Cossacks and then the\r\n      first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and\r\n      artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagratión and\r\n      Dolgorúkov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear before action\r\n      which he had experienced as previously, all the inner struggle to conquer\r\n      that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in\r\n      this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and\r\n      Nicholas Rostóv spent that day in a dull and wretched mood. At nine in the\r\n      morning, he heard firing in front and shouts ofhurrah, and saw wounded\r\n      being brought back (there were not many of them), and at last he saw how a\r\n      whole detachment of French cavalry was brought in, convoyed by asótnyaof\r\n      Cossacks. Evidently the affair was over and, though not big, had been a\r\n      successful engagement. The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant\r\n      victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a\r\n      whole French squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night\r\n      frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the\r\n      news of victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had\r\n      taken part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of\r\n      soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed Rostóv going\r\n      or coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that\r\n      precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all the\r\n      more depressed.\n“Come here, Wostóv. Let’s dwink to dwown our gwief!” shouted Denísov, who\r\n      had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food.\nThe officers gathered round Denísov’s canteen, eating and talking.\n“There! They are bringing another!” cried one of the officers, indicating\r\n      a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two Cossacks.\nOne of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had\r\n      taken from the prisoner.\n“Sell us that horse!” Denísov called out to the Cossacks.\n“If you like, your honor!”\nThe officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner. The\r\n      French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German accent.\r\n      He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he heard some\r\n      French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers, addressing first\r\n      one, then another. He said he would not have been taken, it was not his\r\n      fault but the corporal’s who had sent him to seize some horsecloths,\r\n      though he had told him the Russians were there. And at every word he\r\n      added: “But don’t hurt my little horse!” and stroked the animal. It was\r\n      plain that he did not quite grasp where he was. Now he excused himself for\r\n      having been taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before his own\r\n      officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service. He\r\n      brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the\r\n      French army, which was so alien to us.\nThe Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostóv, being the\r\n      richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.\n“But don’t hurt my little horse!” said the Alsatian good-naturedly to\r\n      Rostóv when the animal was handed over to the hussar.\nRostóv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.\n“Alley! Alley!” said the Cossack, touching the prisoner’s arm to make him\r\n      go on.\n“The Emperor! The Emperor!” was suddenly heard among the hussars.\nAll began to run and bustle, and Rostóv saw coming up the road behind him\r\n      several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone was\r\n      in his place, waiting.\nRostóv did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.\r\n      Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood\r\n      amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of\r\n      himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to the\r\n      Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day\r\n      he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of meeting\r\n      arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he was\r\n      ecstatically conscious ofhisapproach. He felt it not only from the sound\r\n      of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because ashedrew near\r\n      everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive\r\n      around him. Nearer and nearer to Rostóv came that sun shedding beams of\r\n      mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself enveloped in\r\n      those beams, he heardhisvoice, that kindly, calm, and majestic voice\r\n      that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with Rostóv’s feeling, there\r\n      was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the Emperor’s voice.\n“The Pávlograd hussars?” he inquired.\n“The reserves, sire!” replied a voice, a very human one compared to that\r\n      which had said: “The Pávlograd hussars?”\nThe Emperor drew level with Rostóv and halted. Alexander’s face was even\r\n      more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It shone\r\n      with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested the\r\n      liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face of the\r\n      majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the Emperor’s\r\n      eyes met Rostóv’s and rested on them for not more than two seconds.\r\n      Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in Rostóv’s soul\r\n      (it seemed to Rostóv that he understood everything), at any rate his\r\n      light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into Rostóv’s face. A gentle,\r\n      mild light poured from them. Then all at once he raised his eyebrows,\r\n      abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and galloped on.\nThe younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the\r\n      battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve\r\n      o’clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward\r\n      the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met\r\n      him with news of the successful result of the action.\nThis battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was\r\n      represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Emperor and\r\n      the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield,\r\n      believed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against\r\n      their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had passed, the Pávlograd\r\n      division was ordered to advance. In Wischau itself, a petty German town,\r\n      Rostóv saw the Emperor again. In the market place, where there had been\r\n      some rather heavy firing before the Emperor’s arrival, lay several killed\r\n      and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move. The Emperor,\r\n      surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed\r\n      chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at the\r\n      review, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his\r\n      eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered\r\n      head. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his\r\n      proximity to the Emperor shocked Rostóv. Rostóv saw how the Emperor’s\r\n      rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them,\r\n      how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse’s side with the\r\n      spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not\r\n      stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to place\r\n      him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.\n“Gently, gently! Can’t you do it more gently?” said the Emperor apparently\r\n      suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.\nRostóv saw tears filling the Emperor’s eyes and heard him, as he was\r\n      riding away, say to Czartorýski: “What a terrible thing war is: what a\r\n      terrible thing!Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!”\nThe troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight of\r\n      the enemy’s lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us at the\r\n      least firing. The Emperor’s gratitude was announced to the vanguard,\r\n      rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of vodka. The\r\n      campfires crackled and the soldiers’ songs resounded even more merrily\r\n      than on the previous night. Denísov celebrated his promotion to the rank\r\n      of major, and Rostóv, who had already drunk enough, at the end of the\r\n      feast proposed the Emperor’s health. “Not ‘our Sovereign, the Emperor,’ as\r\n      they say at official dinners,” said he, “but the health of our Sovereign,\r\n      that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to\r\n      the certain defeat of the French!”\n“If we fought before,” he said, “not letting the French pass, as at Schön\r\n      Grabern, what shall we not do now whenheis at the front? We will all die\r\n      for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not saying it right,\r\n      I have drunk a good deal—but that is how I feel, and so do you too!\r\n      To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!”\n“Hurrah!” rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.\nAnd the old cavalry captain, Kírsten, shouted enthusiastically and no less\r\n      sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostóv.\nWhen the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kírsten filled\r\n      others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the\r\n      soldiers’ bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest\r\n      showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light of\r\n      the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.\n“Lads! here’s to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our enemies!\r\n      Hurrah!” he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar’s baritone.\nThe hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.\nLate that night, when all had separated, Denísov with his short hand\r\n      patted his favorite, Rostóv, on the shoulder.\n“As there’s no one to fall in love with on campaign, he’s fallen in love\r\n      with the Tsar,” he said.\n“Denísov, don’t make fun of it!” cried Rostóv. “It is such a lofty,\r\n      beautiful feeling, such a...”\n“I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...”\n“No, you don’t understand!”\nAnd Rostóv got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what\r\n      happiness it would be to die—not in saving the Emperor’s life (he\r\n      did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes. He\r\n      really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the\r\n      hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that\r\n      feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz:\r\n      nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less\r\n      ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms."

    "text": "The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,\r\n      was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops\r\n      near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and\r\n      had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this\r\n      indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the\r\n      sight of the killed and wounded.\nAt daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with a flag\r\n      of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was brought into\r\n      Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The Emperor had only\r\n      just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday he was admitted to\r\n      the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with Prince Dolgorúkov to the\r\n      advanced post of the French army.\nIt was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a meeting\r\n      with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a personal\r\n      interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince Dolgorúkov,\r\n      the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon if,\r\n      contrary to expectations, these negotiations were actuated by a real\r\n      desire for peace.\nToward evening Dolgorúkov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and\r\n      remained alone with him for a long time.\nOn the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two days’\r\n      march and the enemy’s outposts after a brief interchange of shots\r\n      retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth, a\r\n      great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of\r\n      the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought.\nTill midday on the nineteenth, the activity—the eager talk, running\r\n      to and fro, and dispatching of adjutants—was confined to the\r\n      Emperor’s headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity\r\n      reached Kutúzov’s headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of\r\n      columns. By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of\r\n      the army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole\r\n      eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of\r\n      voices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles\r\n      long.\nThe concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor’s headquarters in\r\n      the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like the\r\n      first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock. One wheel slowly\r\n      moved, another was set in motion, and a third, and wheels began to revolve\r\n      faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures\r\n      to pop out, and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of\r\n      all that activity.\nJust as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military\r\n      machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as\r\n      indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them\r\n      are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached.\r\n      Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the\r\n      revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a\r\n      neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to\r\n      remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever catches\r\n      it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the\r\n      common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.\nJust as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable\r\n      wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands\r\n      which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human activities\r\n      of 160,000 Russians and French—all their passions, desires, remorse,\r\n      humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasm—was\r\n      only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called battle of the\r\n      three Emperors—that is to say, a slow movement of the hand on the\r\n      dial of human history.\nPrince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the\r\n      commander in chief.\nAt six in the evening, Kutúzov went to the Emperor’s headquarters and\r\n      after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand marshal\r\n      of the court, Count Tolstóy.\nBolkónski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming\r\n      action from Dolgorúkov. He felt that Kutúzov was upset and dissatisfied\r\n      about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him,\r\n      and also that at the Emperor’s headquarters everyone adopted toward him\r\n      the tone of men who know something others do not know: he therefore wished\r\n      to speak to Dolgorúkov.\n“Well, how d’you do, my dear fellow?” said Dolgorúkov, who was sitting at\r\n      tea with Bilíbin. “The fete is for tomorrow. How is your old fellow? Out\r\n      of sorts?”\n“I won’t say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be heard.”\n“But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks\r\n      sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte fears\r\n      nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.”\n“Yes, you have seen him?” said Prince Andrew. “Well, what is Bonaparte\r\n      like? How did he impress you?”\n“Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a\r\n      general engagement,” repeated Dolgorúkov, evidently prizing this general\r\n      conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon. “If\r\n      he weren’t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview? Why\r\n      negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to\r\n      his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid, afraid of a\r\n      general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!”\n“But tell me, what is he like, eh?” said Prince Andrew again.\n“He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him ‘Your\r\n      Majesty,’ but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me! That’s the sort\r\n      of man he is, and nothing more,” replied Dolgorúkov, looking round at\r\n      Bilíbin with a smile.\n“Despite my great respect for old Kutúzov,” he continued, “we should be a\r\n      nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to\r\n      escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands! No,\r\n      we mustn’t forget Suvórov and his rule—not to put yourself in a\r\n      position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe me in war the\r\n      energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience of\r\n      old Cunctators.”\n“But in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the\r\n      outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are\r\n      situated,” said Prince Andrew.\nHe wished to explain to Dolgorúkov a plan of attack he had himself formed.\n“Oh, that is all the same,” Dolgorúkov said quickly, and getting up he\r\n      spread a map on the table. “All eventualities have been foreseen. If he is\r\n      standing before Brünn...”\nAnd Prince Dolgorúkov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother’s plan\r\n      of a flanking movement.\nPrince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might have\r\n      been as good as Weyrother’s, but for the disadvantage that Weyrother’s had\r\n      already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate the\r\n      defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan, Prince Dolgorúkov\r\n      ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the map, but at\r\n      Prince Andrew’s face.\n“There will be a council of war at Kutúzov’s tonight, though; you can say\r\n      all this there,” remarked Dolgorúkov.\n“I will do so,” said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.\n“Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?” said Bilíbin, who, till\r\n      then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was\r\n      evidently ready with a joke. “Whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat,\r\n      the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your Kutúzov, there is not\r\n      a single Russian in command of a column! The commanders are: Herr General\r\n      Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince de\r\n      Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish names.”\n“Be quiet, backbiter!” said Dolgorúkov. “It is not true; there are now two\r\n      Russians, Milorádovich, and Dokhtúrov, and there would be a third, Count\r\n      Arakchéev, if his nerves were not too weak.”\n“However, I think General Kutúzov has come out,” said Prince Andrew. “I\r\n      wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!” he added and went out after\r\n      shaking hands with Dolgorúkov and Bilíbin.\nOn the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutúzov, who\r\n      was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrow’s battle.\nKutúzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied: “I\r\n      think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstóy and asked him\r\n      to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? ‘But, my dear general,\r\n      I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military matters yourself!’\r\n      Yes... That was the answer I got!”"

    "text": "Shortly after nine o’clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his plans to\r\n      Kutúzov’s quarters where the council of war was to be held. All the\r\n      commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief’s and with\r\n      the exception of Prince Bagratión, who declined to come, were all there at\r\n      the appointed time.\nWeyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his\r\n      eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied\r\n      and drowsy Kutúzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and\r\n      president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be at\r\n      the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was like\r\n      a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was pulling\r\n      it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong\r\n      speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to. Weyrother\r\n      had been twice that evening to the enemy’s picket line to reconnoiter\r\n      personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and\r\n      explain, and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in\r\n      German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived at Kutúzov’s.\nHe was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the commander\r\n      in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly, without\r\n      looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to questions put\r\n      to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful, weary, and\r\n      distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and self-confident.\nKutúzov was occupying a nobleman’s castle of modest dimensions near\r\n      Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander in\r\n      chief’s office were gathered Kutúzov himself, Weyrother, and the members\r\n      of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited Prince\r\n      Bagratión to begin the council. At last Bagratión’s orderly came with the\r\n      news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the\r\n      commander in chief of this and, availing himself of permission previously\r\n      given him by Kutúzov to be present at the council, he remained in the\r\n      room.\n“Since Prince Bagratión is not coming, we may begin,” said Weyrother,\r\n      hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an\r\n      enormous map of the environs of Brünn was spread out.\nKutúzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his\r\n      collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair, with his\r\n      podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound of\r\n      Weyrother’s voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.\n“Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late,” said he, and nodding his\r\n      head he let it droop and again closed his eye.\nIf at first the members of the council thought that Kutúzov was pretending\r\n      to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed\r\n      proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far\r\n      more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the\r\n      dispositions or anything else—he was engaged in satisfying the\r\n      irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with\r\n      the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutúzov and,\r\n      having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in a\r\n      loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the\r\n      impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:\n“Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and\r\n      Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.”\nThe dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as\r\n      follows:\n“As the enemy’s left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends\r\n      along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there, while we,\r\n      on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his right, it is\r\n      advantageous to attack the enemy’s latter wing especially if we occupy the\r\n      villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can both fall on his flank\r\n      and pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa\r\n      forest, avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the\r\n      enemy’s front. For this object it is necessary that... The first column\r\n      marches... The second column marches... The third column marches...” and\r\n      so on, read Weyrother.\nThe generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.\r\n      The tall, fair-haired General Buxhöwden stood, leaning his back against\r\n      the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen or\r\n      even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his\r\n      glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards,\r\n      sat the ruddy Milorádovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards,\r\n      his hands on his knees, and his shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly\r\n      silent, gazing at Weyrother’s face, and only turned away his eyes when the\r\n      Austrian chief of staff finished reading. Then Milorádovich looked round\r\n      significantly at the other generals. But one could not tell from that\r\n      significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not\r\n      with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a\r\n      subtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the\r\n      whole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly\r\n      twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the\r\n      middle of one of the longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of\r\n      the snuffbox, raised his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the\r\n      corners of his thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something.\r\n      But the Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked\r\n      his elbows, as if to say: “You can tell me your views later, but now be so\r\n      good as to look at the map and listen.” Langeron lifted his eyes with an\r\n      expression of perplexity, turned round to Milorádovich as if seeking an\r\n      explanation, but meeting the latter’s impressive but meaningless gaze\r\n      drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.\n“A geography lesson!” he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough to be\r\n      heard.\nPrzebyszéwski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his hand to\r\n      his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in attention.\r\n      Dohktúrov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an assiduous and\r\n      modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied\r\n      the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He asked Weyrother several\r\n      times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of\r\n      villages. Weyrother complied and Dohktúrov noted them down.\nWhen the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again\r\n      brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at\r\n      anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out such\r\n      a plan in which the enemy’s position was assumed to be known, whereas it\r\n      was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement. Langeron’s\r\n      objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show\r\n      General Weyrother—who had read his dispositions with as much\r\n      self-confidence as if he were addressing school children—that he had\r\n      to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something in\r\n      military matters.\nWhen the monotonous sound of Weyrother’s voice ceased, Kutúzov opened his\r\n      eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is\r\n      interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking, “So you\r\n      are still at that silly business!” quickly closed his eye again, and let\r\n      his head sink still lower.\nLangeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother’s vanity as\r\n      author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily attack\r\n      instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this plan perfectly\r\n      worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous\r\n      smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what\r\n      they might.\n“If he could attack us, he would have done so today,” said he.\n“So you think he is powerless?” said Langeron.\n“He has forty thousand men at most,” replied Weyrother, with the smile of\r\n      a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case.\n“In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,” said\r\n      Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support\r\n      to Milorádovich who was near him.\nBut Milorádovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather\r\n      than of what the generals were disputing about.\n“Ma foi!”said he, “tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield.”\nWeyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was\r\n      strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to\r\n      have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but had\r\n      also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.\n“The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his\r\n      camp,” said he. “What does that mean? Either he is retreating, which is\r\n      the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.” (He smiled\r\n      ironically.) “But even if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa, he\r\n      merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the\r\n      minutest detail remain the same.”\n“How is that?...” began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting an\r\n      opportunity to express his doubts.\nKutúzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the generals.\n“Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow—or rather for today, for\r\n      it is past midnight—cannot now be altered,” said he. “You have heard\r\n      them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is nothing\r\n      more important...” he paused, “than to have a good sleep.”\nHe moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past\r\n      midnight. Prince Andrew went out.\nThe council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express\r\n      his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy impression.\r\n      Whether Dolgorúkov and Weyrother, or Kutúzov, Langeron, and the others who\r\n      did not approve of the plan of attack, were right—he did not know.\r\n      “But was it really not possible for Kutúzov to state his views plainly to\r\n      the Emperor? Is it possible that on account of court and personal\r\n      considerations tens of thousands of lives, and my life,mylife,” he\r\n      thought, “must be risked?”\n“Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,” he thought. And\r\n      suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most distant, most\r\n      intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered his last parting\r\n      from his father and his wife; he remembered the days when he first loved\r\n      her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself,\r\n      and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in\r\n      which he was billeted with Nesvítski and began to walk up and down before\r\n      it.\nThe night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed\r\n      mysteriously. “Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!” he thought. “Tomorrow everything\r\n      may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none of them will\r\n      have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly, I have a\r\n      presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all I can do.”\r\n       And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the concentration of fighting\r\n      at one point, and the hesitation of all the commanders. And then that\r\n      happy moment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited, presents itself\r\n      to him at last. He firmly and clearly expresses his opinion to Kutúzov, to\r\n      Weyrother, and to the Emperors. All are struck by the justness of his\r\n      views, but no one undertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a\r\n      division—stipulates that no one is to interfere with his arrangements—leads\r\n      his division to the decisive point, and gains the victory alone. “But\r\n      death and suffering?” suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, did\r\n      not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. The\r\n      dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone. Nominally he is\r\n      only an adjutant on Kutúzov’s staff, but he does everything alone. The\r\n      next battle is won by him alone. Kutúzov is removed and he is appointed...\r\n      “Well and then?” asked the other voice. “If before that you are not ten\r\n      times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?...” “Well then,”\r\n       Prince Andrew answered himself, “I don’t know what will happen and don’t\r\n      want to know, and can’t, but if I want this—want glory, want to be\r\n      known to men, want to be loved by them, it is not my fault that I want it\r\n      and want nothing but that and live only for that. Yes, for that alone! I\r\n      shall never tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I love nothing\r\n      but fame and men’s esteem? Death, wounds, the loss of family—I fear\r\n      nothing. And precious and dear as many persons are to me—father,\r\n      sister, wife—those dearest to me—yet dreadful and unnatural as\r\n      it seems, I would give them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph\r\n      over men, of love from men I don’t know and never shall know, for the love\r\n      of these men here,” he thought, as he listened to voices in Kutúzov’s\r\n      courtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one\r\n      voice, probably a coachman’s, was teasing Kutúzov’s old cook whom Prince\r\n      Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying, “Tit, I say, Tit!”\n“Well?” returned the old man.\n“Go, Tit, thresh a bit!” said the wag.\n“Oh, go to the devil!” called out a voice, drowned by the laughter of the\r\n      orderlies and servants.\n“All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I value\r\n      this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this mist!”"

    "text": "That same night, Rostóv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of\r\n      Bagratión’s detachment. His hussars were placed along the line in couples\r\n      and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that\r\n      kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our army’s campfires dimly\r\n      glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him; in front of him was misty\r\n      darkness. Rostóv could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy\r\n      distance: now something gleamed gray, now there was something black, now\r\n      little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be, now he\r\n      fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and\r\n      in his fancy appeared—now the Emperor, now Denísov, and now Moscow\r\n      memories—and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before\r\n      him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he\r\n      came within six paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the\r\n      distance was still the same misty darkness. “Why not?... It might easily\r\n      happen,” thought Rostóv, “that the Emperor will meet me and give me an\r\n      order as he would to any other officer; he’ll say: ‘Go and find out what’s\r\n      there.’ There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just\r\n      such a chance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place\r\n      near him? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I\r\n      would unmask his deceivers!” And in order to realize vividly his love\r\n      devotion to the sovereign, Rostóv pictured to himself an enemy or a\r\n      deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he\r\n      would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout\r\n      aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.\n“Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and watchword—shaft,\r\n      Olmütz.What a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow,” he\r\n      thought. “I’ll ask leave to go to the front, this may be my only chance of\r\n      seeing the Emperor. It won’t be long now before I am off duty. I’ll take\r\n      another turn and when I get back I’ll go to the general and ask him.” He\r\n      readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once\r\n      more round his hussars. It seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To\r\n      the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that\r\n      seemed as steep as a wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that\r\n      Rostóv could not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the\r\n      moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought\r\n      something moved on that white spot. “I expect it’s snow... that spot... a\r\n      spot—une tache,” he thought. “There now... it’s not atache...\r\n      Natásha... sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Won’t she be surprised\r\n      when I tell her how I’ve seen the Emperor?) Natásha... take my\r\n      sabretache...”—“Keep to the right, your honor, there are bushes\r\n      here,” came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostóv was riding in the act\r\n      of falling asleep. Rostóv lifted his head that had sunk almost to his\r\n      horse’s mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was succumbing to\r\n      irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. “But what was I thinking? I\r\n      mustn’t forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No, that’s not it—that’s\r\n      tomorrow. Oh yes! Natásha... sabretache... saber them... Whom? The\r\n      hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along the Tverskáya Street rode\r\n      the hussar with mustaches... I thought about him too, just opposite\r\n      Gúryev’s house... Old Gúryev.... Oh, but Denísov’s a fine fellow. But\r\n      that’s all nonsense. The chief thing is that the Emperor is here. How he\r\n      looked at me and wished to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I\r\n      who dared not. But that’s nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the\r\n      important thing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-tásha, sabretache, oh, yes,\r\n      yes! That’s right!” And his head once more sank to his horse’s neck. All\r\n      at once it seemed to him that he was being fired at. “What? What? What?...\r\n      Cut them down! What?...” said Rostóv, waking up. At the moment he opened\r\n      his eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn\r\n      shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar near\r\n      him pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the shouting\r\n      came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another, and all\r\n      along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew\r\n      louder and louder. Rostóv could hear the sound of French words but could\r\n      not distinguish them. The din of many voices was too great; all he could\r\n      hear was: “ahahah!” and “rrrr!”\n“What’s that? What do you make of it?” said Rostóv to the hussar beside\r\n      him. “That must be the enemy’s camp!”\nThe hussar did not reply.\n“Why, don’t you hear it?” Rostóv asked again, after waiting for a reply.\n“Who can tell, your honor?” replied the hussar reluctantly.\n“From the direction, it must be the enemy,” repeated Rostóv.\n“It may beheor it may be nothing,” muttered the hussar. “It’s dark...\r\n      Steady!” he cried to his fidgeting horse.\nRostóv’s horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,\r\n      pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting\r\n      grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of\r\n      several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and farther,\r\n      probably along the line of the French camp. Rostóv no longer wanted to\r\n      sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating\r\n      effect on him.“Vive l’Empereur! l’Empereur!”he now heard distinctly.\n“They can’t be far off, probably just beyond the stream,” he said to the\r\n      hussar beside him.\nThe hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound of\r\n      horse’s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard,\r\n      and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly\r\n      appeared, looming huge as an elephant.\n“Your honor, the generals!” said the sergeant, riding up to Rostóv.\nRostóv, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with the\r\n      sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line. One was\r\n      on a white horse. Prince Bagratión and Prince Dolgorúkov with their\r\n      adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and\r\n      shouts in the enemy’s camp. Rostóv rode up to Bagratión, reported to him,\r\n      and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying.\n“Believe me,” said Prince Dolgorúkov, addressing Bagratión, “it is nothing\r\n      but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires\r\n      and make a noise to deceive us.”\n“Hardly,” said Bagratión. “I saw them this evening on that knoll; if they\r\n      had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too.... Officer!” said\r\n      Bagratión to Rostóv, “are the enemy’s skirmishers still there?”\n“They were there this evening, but now I don’t know, your excellency.\r\n      Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?” replied Rostóv.\nBagratión stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostóv’s face in the\r\n      mist.\n“Well, go and see,” he said, after a pause.\n“Yes, sir.”\nRostóv spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fédchenko and two other\r\n      hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction\r\n      from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be\r\n      riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty\r\n      distance where no one had been before him. Bagratión called to him from\r\n      the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostóv pretended not to hear him\r\n      and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes for\r\n      trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes. Having\r\n      descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or the\r\n      enemy’s fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and\r\n      distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river, but\r\n      when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto the road\r\n      he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it\r\n      and ride over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the road which\r\n      gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be easier\r\n      to see people coming along it. “Follow me!” said he, crossed the road, and\r\n      began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where the French\r\n      pickets had been standing that evening.\n“Your honor, there he is!” cried one of the hussars behind him. And before\r\n      Rostóv had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly\r\n      appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet\r\n      whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing.\r\n      Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan. Rostóv turned his horse\r\n      and galloped back. Four more reports followed at intervals, and the\r\n      bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones. Rostóv\r\n      reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, like his own, at the firing,\r\n      and went back at a footpace. “Well, some more! Some more!” a merry voice\r\n      was saying in his soul. But no more shots came.\nOnly when approaching Bagratión did Rostóv let his horse gallop again, and\r\n      with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.\nDolgorúkov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had only\r\n      lit fires to deceive us.\n“What does that prove?” he was saying as Rostóv rode up. “They might\r\n      retreat and leave the pickets.”\n“It’s plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,” said Bagratión.\r\n      “Wait till tomorrow morning, we’ll find out everything tomorrow.”\n“The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was in\r\n      the evening,” reported Rostóv, stooping forward with his hand at the\r\n      salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and\r\n      especially by the sound of the bullets.\n“Very good, very good,” said Bagratión. “Thank you, officer.”\n“Your excellency,” said Rostóv, “may I ask a favor?”\n“What is it?”\n“Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached to\r\n      the first squadron?”\n“What’s your name?”\n“Count Rostóv.”\n“Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.”\n“Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son?” asked Dolgorúkov.\nBut Rostóv did not reply.\n“Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?”\n“I will give the order.”\n“Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the Emperor,”\r\n       thought Rostóv.\n“Thank God!”\nThe fires and shouting in the enemy’s army were occasioned by the fact\r\n      that while Napoleon’s proclamation was being read to the troops the\r\n      Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him, lit\r\n      wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting,“Vive l’Empereur!”Napoleon’s\r\n      proclamation was as follows:\nSoldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the Austrian\r\n      army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at Hollabrünn and have\r\n      pursued ever since to this place. The position we occupy is a strong one,\r\n      and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will expose a\r\n      flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct your battalions. I will keep\r\n      out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion\r\n      into the enemy’s ranks, but should victory be in doubt, even for a moment,\r\n      you will see your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the\r\n      enemy, for there must be no doubt of victory, especially on this day when\r\n      what is at stake is the honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the\r\n      honor of our nation.\nDo not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every man\r\n      be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of\r\n      England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will conclude\r\n      our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh French\r\n      troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace I shall\r\n      conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.\nNAPOLEON"

    "text": "At five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the center,\r\n      the reserves, and Bagratión’s right flank had not yet moved, but on the\r\n      left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which were to\r\n      be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right flank and\r\n      drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan, were already up\r\n      and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they were throwing\r\n      everything superfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold and dark. The\r\n      officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the soldiers,\r\n      munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves,\r\n      gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds,\r\n      chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they did not want or\r\n      could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides were moving in and\r\n      out among the Russian troops and served as heralds of the advance. As soon\r\n      as an Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer’s\r\n      quarters, the regiment began to move: the soldiers ran from the fires,\r\n      thrust their pipes into their boots, their bags into the carts, got their\r\n      muskets ready, and formed rank. The officers buttoned up their coats,\r\n      buckled on their swords and pouches, and moved along the ranks shouting.\r\n      The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied\r\n      on the loads. The adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders\r\n      mounted, crossed themselves, gave final instructions, orders, and\r\n      commissions to the baggage men who remained behind, and the monotonous\r\n      tramp of thousands of feet resounded. The column moved forward without\r\n      knowing where and unable, from the masses around them, the smoke and the\r\n      increasing fog, to see either the place they were leaving or that to which\r\n      they were going.\nA soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as\r\n      much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever\r\n      strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is\r\n      always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so\r\n      the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the\r\n      same sergeant major Iván Mítrich, the same company dog Jack, and the same\r\n      commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship\r\n      is sailing, but on the day of battle—heaven knows how and whence—a\r\n      stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an\r\n      army, announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn, and\r\n      awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of battle the\r\n      soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment, they\r\n      listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning what is going on\r\n      around them.\nThe fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not\r\n      see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground\r\n      like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might encounter an\r\n      enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced for a long time,\r\n      always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills, avoiding gardens\r\n      and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and nowhere\r\n      encountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became aware that in\r\n      front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns were moving in the\r\n      same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place\r\n      where he was going, many more of our men were going too.\n“There now, the Kúrskies have also gone past,” was being said in the\r\n      ranks.\n“It’s wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last night I\r\n      looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular Moscow!”\nThough none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the\r\n      men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of humor\r\n      and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves to cheer\r\n      the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops marched gaily,\r\n      as they always do when going into action, especially to an attack. But\r\n      when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog, the greater part\r\n      of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation\r\n      and blunder spread through the ranks. How such a consciousness is\r\n      communicated is very difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated\r\n      very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as water\r\n      does in a creek. Had the Russian army been alone without any allies, it\r\n      might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of\r\n      mismanagement became a general conviction, but as it was, the disorder was\r\n      readily and naturally attributed to the stupid Germans, and everyone was\r\n      convinced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage\r\n      eaters.\n“Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up\r\n      against the French?”\n“No, one can’t hear them. They’d be firing if we had.”\n“They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in the\r\n      middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It’s all those damned Germans’\r\n      muddling! What stupid devils!”\n“Yes, I’d send them on in front, but no fear, they’re crowding up behind.\r\n      And now here we stand hungry.”\n“I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the\r\n      way,” said an officer.\n“Ah, those damned Germans! They don’t know their own country!” said\r\n      another.\n“What division are you?” shouted an adjutant, riding up.\n“The Eighteenth.”\n“Then why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you won’t\r\n      get there till evening.”\n“What stupid orders! They don’t themselves know what they are doing!” said\r\n      the officer and rode off.\nThen a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.\n“Tafa-lafa! But what he’s jabbering no one can make out,” said a soldier,\r\n      mimicking the general who had ridden away. “I’d shoot them, the\r\n      scoundrels!”\n“We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven’t got\r\n      halfway. Fine orders!” was being repeated on different sides.\nAnd the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn\r\n      into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the Germans.\nThe cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was moving\r\n      toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center was too\r\n      far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to\r\n      turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the\r\n      infantry, who had to wait.\nAt the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a\r\n      Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be\r\n      halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to\r\n      blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After\r\n      an hour’s delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog that\r\n      was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they were\r\n      descending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another, at\r\n      first irregularly at varying intervals—trata...tat—and then\r\n      more and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream\r\n      began.\nNot expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having stumbled\r\n      on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their commanders, and\r\n      with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks, and\r\n      above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the\r\n      thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced\r\n      and again halted, receiving no timely orders from the officers or\r\n      adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings\r\n      unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action began for the\r\n      first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into the valley. The\r\n      fourth column, with which Kutúzov was, stood on the Pratzen Heights.\nBelow, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the\r\n      higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was going\r\n      on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed, six miles\r\n      away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one knew till\r\n      after eight o’clock.\nIt was nine o’clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea down\r\n      below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood\r\n      with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was a clear\r\n      blue sky, and the sun’s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson\r\n      float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French army, and\r\n      even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side of the\r\n      streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we intended\r\n      to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this side, so\r\n      close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish\r\n      a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had\r\n      worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in\r\n      front of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise\r\n      out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving in the\r\n      distance, and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley. Not a\r\n      single muscle of his face—which in those days was still thin—moved.\r\n      His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot. His predictions were\r\n      being justified. Part of the Russian force had already descended into the\r\n      valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these Pratzen\r\n      Heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the\r\n      position. He saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the\r\n      village of Pratzen, the Russian columns, their bayonets glittering, were\r\n      moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing\r\n      one after another into the mist. From information he had received the\r\n      evening before, from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the\r\n      outposts during the night, by the disorderly movement of the Russian\r\n      columns, and from all indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed\r\n      him to be far away in front of them, and that the columns moving near\r\n      Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army, and that that center\r\n      was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still\r\n      he did not begin the engagement.\nToday was a great day for him—the anniversary of his coronation.\r\n      Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and in\r\n      good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that\r\n      happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds. He\r\n      sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above the mist, and his\r\n      cold face wore that special look of confident, self-complacent happiness\r\n      that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love. The marshals stood\r\n      behind him not venturing to distract his attention. He looked now at the\r\n      Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating up out of the mist.\nWhen the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were\r\n      aglow with dazzling light—as if he had only awaited this to begin\r\n      the action—he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a\r\n      sign with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The\r\n      marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions,\r\n      and a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly\r\n      toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by\r\n      Russian troops moving down the valley to their left."

    "text": "At eight o’clock Kutúzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth column,\r\n      Milorádovich’s, the one that was to take the place of Przebyszéwski’s and\r\n      Langeron’s columns which had already gone down into the valley. He greeted\r\n      the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march, thereby\r\n      indicating that he intended to lead that column himself. When he had\r\n      reached the village of Pratzen he halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among\r\n      the immense number forming the commander in chief’s suite. He was in a\r\n      state of suppressed excitement and irritation, though controlledly calm as\r\n      a man is at the approach of a long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced\r\n      that this was the day of his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How it would\r\n      come about he did not know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality\r\n      and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be\r\n      known to anyone in our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could\r\n      not now be carried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother’s\r\n      plan, Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new\r\n      projects such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.\nTo the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces\r\n      could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would\r\n      concentrate. “There we shall encounter difficulties, and there,” thought\r\n      he, “I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there, standard in\r\n      hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me.”\nHe could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.\r\n      Seeing them he kept thinking, “That may be the very standard with which I\r\n      shall lead the army.”\nIn the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a\r\n      hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a\r\n      milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which\r\n      our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing. Above\r\n      the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb of the\r\n      sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist, some\r\n      wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably was,\r\n      for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were entering the\r\n      misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of\r\n      bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up\r\n      and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and behind moved infantry.\r\n      The commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting the\r\n      troops pass by him. That morning Kutúzov seemed worn and irritable. The\r\n      infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command being\r\n      given, apparently obstructed by something in front.\n“Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village!”\r\n       he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. “Don’t you understand,\r\n      your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile through narrow\r\n      village streets when we are marching against the enemy?”\n“I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,” answered\r\n      the general.\nKutúzov laughed bitterly.\n“You’ll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy! Very\r\n      fine!”\n“The enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the\r\n      dispositions...”\n“The dispositions!” exclaimed Kutúzov bitterly. “Who told you that?...\r\n      Kindly do as you are ordered.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“My dear fellow,” Nesvítski whispered to Prince Andrew, “the old man is as\r\n      surly as a dog.”\nAn Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat\r\n      galloped up to Kutúzov and asked in the Emperor’s name had the fourth\r\n      column advanced into action.\nKutúzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon\r\n      Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutúzov’s malevolent and\r\n      caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was being done was\r\n      not his adjutant’s fault, and still not answering the Austrian adjutant,\r\n      he addressed Bolkónski.\n“Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the\r\n      village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.”\nHardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.\n“And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,” he added. “What are they\r\n      doing? What are they doing?” he murmured to himself, still not replying to\r\n      the Austrian.\nPrince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.\nOvertaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped the third\r\n      division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in\r\n      front of our columns. The colonel at the head of the regiment was much\r\n      surprised at the commander in chief’s order to throw out skirmishers. He\r\n      had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and\r\n      that the enemy must be at least six miles away. There was really nothing\r\n      to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist. Having\r\n      given orders in the commander in chief’s name to rectify this omission,\r\n      Prince Andrew galloped back. Kutúzov still in the same place, his stout\r\n      body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age, sat yawning\r\n      wearily with closed eyes. The troops were no longer moving, but stood with\r\n      the butts of their muskets on the ground.\n“All right, all right!” he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a general\r\n      who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all the\r\n      left-flank columns had already descended.\n“Plenty of time, your excellency,” muttered Kutúzov in the midst of a\r\n      yawn. “Plenty of time,” he repeated.\nJust then at a distance behind Kutúzov was heard the sound of regiments\r\n      saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line\r\n      of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were greeting\r\n      was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which\r\n      Kutúzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one side and\r\n      looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped what\r\n      looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them rode\r\n      side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with white\r\n      plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a\r\n      white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors followed by\r\n      their suites. Kutúzov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the\r\n      front, gave the command “Attention!” and rode up to the Emperors with a\r\n      salute. His whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed. He put\r\n      on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning. With an\r\n      affectation of respect which evidently struck Alexander unpleasantly, he\r\n      rode up and saluted.\nThis unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of\r\n      the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished. After\r\n      his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmütz\r\n      where Bolkónski had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was\r\n      still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine\r\n      gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying\r\n      expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent\r\n      youth.\nAt the Olmütz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed brighter\r\n      and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles, and\r\n      reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of\r\n      his suite, young and animated as his own. Czartorýski, Novosíltsev, Prince\r\n      Volkónsky, Strógonov, and the others, all richly dressed gay young men on\r\n      splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly heated horses, exchanging\r\n      remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the Emperor. The Emperor Francis,\r\n      a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse,\r\n      looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner. He beckoned to\r\n      one of his white adjutants and asked some question—“Most likely he\r\n      is asking at what o’clock they started,” thought Prince Andrew, watching\r\n      his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his\r\n      reception at Brünn. In the Emperors’ suite were the picked young orderly\r\n      officers of the Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them\r\n      were grooms leading the Tsar’s beautiful relay horses covered with\r\n      embroidered cloths.\nAs when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a\r\n      stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of success\r\n      reached Kutúzov’s cheerless staff with the galloping advent of all these\r\n      brilliant young men.\n“Why aren’t you beginning, Michael Ilariónovich?” said the Emperor\r\n      Alexander hurriedly to Kutúzov, glancing courteously at the same time at\r\n      the Emperor Francis.\n“I am waiting, Your Majesty,” answered Kutúzov, bending forward\r\n      respectfully.\nThe Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not\r\n      quite heard.\n“Waiting, Your Majesty,” repeated Kutúzov. (Prince Andrew noted that\r\n      Kutúzov’s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word “waiting.”)\r\n      “Not all the columns have formed up yet, Your Majesty.”\nThe Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his\r\n      rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosíltsev who was near him, as if\r\n      complaining of Kutúzov.\n“You know, Michael Ilariónovich, we are not on the Empress’ Field where\r\n      a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,” said the Tsar\r\n      with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if not to\r\n      join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the Emperor Francis\r\n      continued to look about him and did not listen.\n“That is just why I do not begin, sire,” said Kutúzov in a resounding\r\n      voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and\r\n      again something in his face twitched—“That is just why I do not\r\n      begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Empress’\r\n      Field,” said he clearly and distinctly.\nIn the Emperor’s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed\r\n      dissatisfaction and reproach. “Old though he may be, he should not, he\r\n      certainly should not, speak like that,” their glances seemed to say.\nThe Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutúzov’s eye waiting to\r\n      hear whether he would say anything more. But Kutúzov, with respectfully\r\n      bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted for about a\r\n      minute.\n“However, if you command it, Your Majesty,” said Kutúzov, lifting his\r\n      head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but submissive\r\n      general.\nHe touched his horse and having called Milorádovich, the commander of the\r\n      column, gave him the order to advance.\nThe troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Nóvgorod and one\r\n      of the Ápsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.\nAs this Ápsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Milorádovich, without\r\n      his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of\r\n      plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back,\r\n      galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined in his\r\n      horse before the Emperor.\n“God be with you, general!” said the Emperor.\n“Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilité, sire,”* he\r\n      answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of\r\n      the Tsar’s suite by his poor French.\n* “Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to\r\n     do, Sire.”\nMilorádovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little\r\n      behind the Emperor. The Ápsheron men, excited by the Tsar’s presence,\r\n      passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk pace.\n“Lads!” shouted Milorádovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery voice,\r\n      obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of battle, and\r\n      by the sight of the gallant Ápsherons, his comrades in Suvórov’s time, now\r\n      passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he forgot the sovereigns’\r\n      presence. “Lads, it’s not the first village you’ve had to take,” cried he.\n“Glad to do our best!” shouted the soldiers.\nThe Emperor’s horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had carried\r\n      the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of\r\n      Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its\r\n      ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the Empress’ Field, not\r\n      understanding the significance of the firing, nor of the nearness of the\r\n      Emperor Francis’ black cob, nor of all that was being said, thought, and\r\n      felt that day by its rider.\nThe Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark\r\n      to him, pointing to the gallant Ápsherons."

    "text": "Kutúzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the\r\n      carabineers.\nWhen he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he\r\n      stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an inn,\r\n      where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were marching\r\n      along both.\nThe fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible\r\n      about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on the\r\n      left, the firing became more distinct. Kutúzov had stopped and was\r\n      speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind\r\n      looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.\n“Look, look!” said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the\r\n      distance, but down the hill before him. “It’s the French!”\nThe two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying to\r\n      snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces suddenly\r\n      changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a mile and a half\r\n      away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us.\n“It’s the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But how is\r\n      that?” said different voices.\nWith the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more\r\n      than five hundred paces from where Kutúzov was standing, a dense French\r\n      column coming up to meet the Ápsherons.\n“Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,” thought\r\n      Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutúzov.\n“The Ápsherons must be stopped, your excellency,” cried he. But at that\r\n      very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard quite\r\n      close at hand, and a voice of naïve terror barely two steps from Prince\r\n      Andrew shouted, “Brothers! All’s lost!” And at this as if at a command,\r\n      everyone began to run.\nConfused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five\r\n      minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it have\r\n      been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to be\r\n      carried back with it oneself. Bolkónski only tried not to lose touch with\r\n      it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in\r\n      front of him. Nesvítski with an angry face, red and unlike himself, was\r\n      shouting to Kutúzov that if he did not ride away at once he would\r\n      certainly be taken prisoner. Kutúzov remained in the same place and\r\n      without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing from his\r\n      cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to him.\n“You are wounded?” he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of his\r\n      lower jaw.\n“The wound is not here, it is there!” said Kutúzov, pressing the\r\n      handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers.\r\n      “Stop them!” he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that\r\n      it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.\nA fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.\nThe troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them\r\n      it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, “Get on! Why are you\r\n      hindering us?” Another in the same place turned round and fired in the\r\n      air; a third was striking the horse Kutúzov himself rode. Having by a\r\n      great effort got away to the left from that flood of men, Kutúzov, with\r\n      his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a sound of artillery\r\n      fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives, Prince\r\n      Andrew, trying to keep near Kutúzov, saw on the slope of the hill amid the\r\n      smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and Frenchmen running toward\r\n      it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry, neither moving forward to\r\n      protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd. A mounted general\r\n      separated himself from the infantry and approached Kutúzov. Of Kutúzov’s\r\n      suite only four remained. They were all pale and exchanged looks in\r\n      silence.\n“Stop those wretches!” gasped Kutúzov to the regimental commander,\r\n      pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish him\r\n      for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across\r\n      Kutúzov’s suite like a flock of little birds.\nThe French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutúzov, were firing at\r\n      him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg;\r\n      several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag\r\n      let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the muskets\r\n      of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without orders.\n“Oh! Oh! Oh!” groaned Kutúzov despairingly and looked around....\r\n      “Bolkónski!” he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness of the\r\n      feebleness of age, “Bolkónski!” he whispered, pointing to the disordered\r\n      battalion and at the enemy, “what’s that?”\nBut before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of shame\r\n      and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to the\r\n      standard.\n“Forward, lads!” he shouted in a voice piercing as a child’s.\n“Here it is!” thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing\r\n      with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him. Several\r\n      soldiers fell.\n“Hurrah!” shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the heavy\r\n      standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion\r\n      would follow him.\nAnd really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then\r\n      another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting “Hurrah!” and\r\n      overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that\r\n      was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew’s hands, but he was\r\n      immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and, dragging\r\n      it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our\r\n      artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned\r\n      their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry soldiers\r\n      who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round. Prince\r\n      Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon.\r\n      He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and\r\n      left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped. But he did not look\r\n      at them: he looked only at what was going on in front of him—at the\r\n      battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his\r\n      shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged\r\n      at the other. He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression\r\n      on the faces of these two men, who evidently did not realize what they\r\n      were doing.\n“What are they about?” thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them. “Why\r\n      doesn’t the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why doesn’t the\r\n      Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the Frenchman remembers\r\n      his bayonet and stabs him....”\nAnd really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the\r\n      struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had\r\n      triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him,\r\n      was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It\r\n      seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head\r\n      with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of it\r\n      was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had been\r\n      looking at.\n“What’s this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,” thought he, and fell\r\n      on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the\r\n      Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner had been\r\n      killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved. But he\r\n      saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the sky—the lofty\r\n      sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding\r\n      slowly across it. “How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all as I ran,”\r\n       thought Prince Andrew—“not as we ran, shouting and fighting, not at\r\n      all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces\r\n      struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds glide across that\r\n      lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky before? And\r\n      how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all\r\n      falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that.\r\n      But even it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace. Thank\r\n      God!...”"

    "text": "On our right flank commanded by Bagratión, at nine o’clock the battle had\r\n      not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorúkov’s demand to commence the\r\n      action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagratión\r\n      proposed to Dolgorúkov to send to inquire of the commander in chief.\r\n      Bagratión knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than\r\n      six miles, even if the messenger were not killed (which he very likely\r\n      would be), and found the commander in chief (which would be very\r\n      difficult), he would not be able to get back before evening.\nBagratión cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite, and\r\n      the boyish face of Rostóv, breathless with excitement and hope, was the first\r\n      to catch his eye. He sent him.\n“And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chief,\r\n      your excellency?” said Rostóv, with his hand to his cap.\n“You can give the message to His Majesty,” said Dolgorúkov, hurriedly\r\n      interrupting Bagratión.\nOn being relieved from picket duty Rostóv had managed to get a few hours’\r\n      sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with\r\n      elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in that\r\n      state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and easy.\nAll his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a\r\n      general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was\r\n      orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a\r\n      message to Kutúzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning was\r\n      bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of joy and\r\n      happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped\r\n      along the line. At first he rode along the line of Bagratión’s troops,\r\n      which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless; then\r\n      he came to the region occupied by Uvárov’s cavalry and here he noticed a\r\n      stir and signs of preparation for battle; having passed Uvárov’s cavalry\r\n      he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him. The firing\r\n      grew louder and louder.\nIn the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots at\r\n      irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots, but a\r\n      roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before Pratzen,\r\n      interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of\r\n      them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar.\nHe could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down\r\n      the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading, and mingling\r\n      with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets visible through\r\n      the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of\r\n      artillery with green caissons.\nRostóv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going\r\n      on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make\r\n      out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of some sort\r\n      were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops; but why,\r\n      whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out. These sights\r\n      and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him; on the\r\n      contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.\n“Go on! Go on! Give it them!” he mentally exclaimed at these sounds, and\r\n      again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and farther\r\n      into the region where the army was already in action.\n“How it will be there I don’t know, but all will be well!” thought Rostóv.\nAfter passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the\r\n      line (the Guards) was already in action.\n“So much the better! I shall see it close,” he thought.\nHe was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came galloping\r\n      toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning\r\n      from the attack. Rostóv got out of their way, involuntarily noticed that\r\n      one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.\n“That is no business of mine,” he thought. He had not ridden many hundred\r\n      yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole width of the\r\n      field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on\r\n      black horses, trotting straight toward him and across his path. Rostóv put\r\n      his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men, and he would\r\n      have got clear had they continued at the same speed, but they kept\r\n      increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping.\r\n      Rostóv heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and\r\n      saw their horses, their figures, and even their faces, more and more\r\n      distinctly. They were our Horse Guards, advancing to attack the French\r\n      cavalry that was coming to meet them.\nThe Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses. Rostóv\r\n      could already see their faces and heard the command: “Charge!” shouted by\r\n      an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed. Rostóv, fearing\r\n      to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the\r\n      front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid\r\n      them.\nThe last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily on\r\n      seeing Rostóv before him, with whom he would inevitably collide. This\r\n      Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostóv and his Bedouin over (Rostóv\r\n      felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and\r\n      horses) had it not occurred to Rostóv to flourish his whip before the eyes\r\n      of the Guardsman’s horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen hands high,\r\n      shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge\r\n      spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its\r\n      neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostóv\r\n      before he heard them shout, “Hurrah!” and looking back saw that their\r\n      foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets,\r\n      probably French. He could see nothing more, for immediately afterwards\r\n      cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything.\nAt that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in the\r\n      smoke, Rostóv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was\r\n      sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the\r\n      French themselves. Rostóv was horrified to hear later that of all that\r\n      mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich youths,\r\n      officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their thousand-ruble\r\n      horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.\n“Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see the\r\n      Emperor immediately!” thought Rostóv and galloped on.\nWhen he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and\r\n      around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so much\r\n      because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers’\r\n      faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers.\nPassing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a\r\n      voice calling him by name.\n“Rostóv!”\n“What?” he answered, not recognizing Borís.\n“I say, we’ve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!” said Borís\r\n      with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under\r\n      fire for the first time.\nRostóv stopped.\n“Have you?” he said. “Well, how did it go?”\n“We drove them back!” said Borís with animation, growing talkative. “Can\r\n      you imagine it?” and he began describing how the Guards, having taken up\r\n      their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were Austrians,\r\n      and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those\r\n      troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to\r\n      go into action. Rostóv without hearing Borís to the end spurred his horse.\n“Where are you off to?” asked Borís.\n“With a message to His Majesty.”\n“There he is!” said Borís, thinking Rostóv had said “His Highness,” and\r\n      pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows\r\n      stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse Guards’\r\n      jacket, shouting something to a pale, white uniformed Austrian officer.\n“But that’s the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the\r\n      Emperor,” said Rostóv, and was about to spur his horse.\n“Count! Count!” shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as\r\n      Borís. “Count! I am wounded in my right hand” (and he showed his bleeding\r\n      hand with a handkerchief tied round it) “and I remained at the front. I\r\n      held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family—the von Bergs—have\r\n      been knights!”\nHe said something more, but Rostóv did not wait to hear it and rode away.\nHaving passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostóv, to avoid\r\n      again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse\r\n      Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place\r\n      where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he heard\r\n      musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops, where he\r\n      could never have expected the enemy to be.\n“What can it be?” he thought. “The enemy in the rear of our army?\r\n      Impossible!” And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and\r\n      for the issue of the whole battle. “But be that what it may,” he\r\n      reflected, “there is no riding round it now. I must look for the commander\r\n      in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest.”\nThe foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostóv was more and\r\n      more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of\r\n      Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.\n“What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is firing?”\r\n       Rostóv kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers running\r\n      in confused crowds across his path.\n“The devil knows! They’ve killed everybody! It’s all up now!” he was told\r\n      in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who understood\r\n      what was happening as little as he did.\n“Kill the Germans!” shouted one.\n“May the devil take them—the traitors!”\n“Zum Henker diese Russen!”* muttered a German.\n* “Hang these Russians!”\nSeveral wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams,\r\n      and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down. Rostóv\r\n      learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing at one\r\n      another.\n“My God! What does it all mean?” thought he. “And here, where at any\r\n      moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a handful\r\n      of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can’t bethat, it can’t be! Only\r\n      to get past them quicker, quicker!”\nThe idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostóv’s head. Though he saw\r\n      French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he had\r\n      been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not, did not\r\n      wish to, believethat."

    "text": "Rostóv had been ordered to look for Kutúzov and the Emperor near the\r\n      village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer were\r\n      there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He urged on\r\n      his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but the farther\r\n      he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on which he had come\r\n      out was thronged withcalèches, carriages of all sorts, and Russian and\r\n      Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and some not. This whole mass\r\n      droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls\r\n      flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights.\n“Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutúzov?” Rostóv kept asking everyone he\r\n      could stop, but got no answer from anyone.\nAt last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.\n“Eh, brother! They’ve all bolted long ago!” said the soldier, laughing for\r\n      some reason and shaking himself free.\nHaving left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostóv stopped the horse\r\n      of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question\r\n      him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a carriage at full\r\n      speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was\r\n      dangerously wounded.\n“It can’t be!” said Rostóv. “It must have been someone else.”\n“I saw him myself,” replied the man with a self-confident smile of\r\n      derision. “I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I’ve seen\r\n      him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in the\r\n      carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black horses fly!\r\n      Gracious me, they did rattle past! It’s time I knew the Imperial horses\r\n      and Ilyá Iványch. I don’t think Ilyá drives anyone except the Tsar!”\nRostóv let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded\r\n      officer passing by addressed him:\n“Who is it you want?” he asked. “The commander in chief? He was\r\n      killed by a cannon ball—struck in the breast before our regiment.”\n“Not killed—wounded!” another officer corrected him.\n“Who? Kutúzov?” asked Rostóv.\n“Not Kutúzov, but what’s his name—well, never mind... there are not\r\n      many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders are\r\n      there,” said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek, and he\r\n      walked on.\nRostóv rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going.\r\n      The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to doubt it\r\n      now. Rostóv rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which he saw\r\n      turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say to the\r\n      Tsar or to Kutúzov, even if they were alive and unwounded?\n“Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!” a\r\n      soldier shouted to him. “They’d kill you there!”\n“Oh, what are you talking about?” said another. “Where is he to go? That\r\n      way is nearer.”\nRostóv considered, and then went in the direction where they said he would\r\n      be killed.\n“It’s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to save\r\n      myself?” he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest number of\r\n      men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not yet occupied\r\n      that region, and the Russians—the uninjured and slightly wounded—had\r\n      left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of manure on well-kept\r\n      plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of\r\n      acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear\r\n      their distressing screams and groans, sometimes feigned—or so it\r\n      seemed to Rostóv. He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these\r\n      suffering men, and he felt afraid—afraid not for his life, but for\r\n      the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these\r\n      unfortunates.\nThe French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and\r\n      wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant\r\n      riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The sensation\r\n      of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in\r\n      Rostóv’s mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself. He\r\n      remembered his mother’s last letter. “What would she feel,” thought he,\r\n      “if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me?”\nIn the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the\r\n      field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less disordered.\r\n      The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far\r\n      away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost. No one\r\n      whom Rostóv asked could tell him where the Emperor or Kutúzov was. Some\r\n      said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it\r\n      was not, and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that\r\n      the Emperor’s carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with\r\n      the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstóy, who had ridden out\r\n      to the battlefield with others in the Emperor’s suite. One officer told\r\n      Rostóv that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to\r\n      the left, and thither Rostóv rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to\r\n      ease his conscience. When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the\r\n      last of the Russian troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch\r\n      round it, two men on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in\r\n      his hat seemed familiar to Rostóv; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse\r\n      (which Rostóv fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his\r\n      horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only a\r\n      little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse’s hind hoofs. Turning\r\n      the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed\r\n      the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do\r\n      the same. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar to Rostóv and\r\n      involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his\r\n      head and hand and by that gesture Rostóv instantly recognized his lamented\r\n      and adored monarch.\n“But it can’t be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!” thought\r\n      Rostóv. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostóv saw the\r\n      beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The Emperor\r\n      was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm, the\r\n      mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rostóv was happy in the\r\n      assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false. He\r\n      was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even ought to go\r\n      straight to him and give the message Dolgorúkov had ordered him to\r\n      deliver.\nBut as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the\r\n      thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a\r\n      chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is\r\n      alone withher, so Rostóv, now that he had attained what he had longed for\r\n      more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach the\r\n      Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be\r\n      inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.\n“What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being\r\n      alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him\r\n      at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him now, when my\r\n      heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him?” Not one\r\n      of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed\r\n      in his imagination could he now recall. Those speeches were intended for\r\n      quite other conditions, they were for the most part to be spoken at a\r\n      moment of victory and triumph, generally when he was dying of wounds and\r\n      the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and while dying he\r\n      expressed the love his actions had proved.\n“Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right\r\n      flank now that it is nearly four o’clock and the battle is lost? No,\r\n      certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his reflections.\r\n      Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad\r\n      opinion from him,” Rostóv decided; and sorrowfully and with a heart full\r\n      despair he rode away, continually looking back at the Tsar, who still\r\n      remained in the same attitude of indecision.\nWhile Rostóv was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away, Captain\r\n      von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the Emperor at once\r\n      rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him to cross the ditch\r\n      on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling unwell, sat down under\r\n      an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him. Rostóv from a distance saw\r\n      with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor\r\n      and how the Emperor, evidently weeping, covered his eyes with his hand and\r\n      pressed von Toll’s hand.\n“And I might have been in his place!” thought Rostóv, and hardly\r\n      restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter\r\n      despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.\nHis despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the\r\n      cause of his grief.\nHe might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It\r\n      was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not\r\n      made use of it.... “What have I done?” thought he. And he turned round and\r\n      galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but there was no\r\n      one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages were passing by.\r\n      From one of the drivers he learned that Kutúzov’s staff were not far off,\r\n      in the village the vehicles were going to. Rostóv followed them. In front\r\n      of him walked Kutúzov’s groom leading horses in horsecloths. Then came a\r\n      cart, and behind that walked an old, bandy-legged domestic serf in a\r\n      peaked cap and sheepskin coat.\n“Tit! I say, Tit!” said the groom.\n“What?” answered the old man absent-mindedly.\n“Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!”\n“Oh, you fool!” said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed in\r\n      silence, and then the same joke was repeated.\n\nBefore five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points. More\r\n      than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.\nPrzebyszéwski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns after\r\n      losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses.\nThe remains of Langeron’s and Dokhtúrov’s mingled forces were crowding\r\n      around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd.\nAfter five o’clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade\r\n      (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous\r\n      batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our\r\n      retreating forces.\nIn the rearguard, Dokhtúrov and others rallying some battalions kept up a\r\n      musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It was\r\n      growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old\r\n      miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling,\r\n      while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floundering\r\n      silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for so many years\r\n      Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their\r\n      two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour\r\n      whitening their carts—on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the\r\n      cannon, under the horses’ hoofs and between the wagon wheels, men\r\n      disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one another,\r\n      dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to move on a\r\n      few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.\nEvery ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or a\r\n      shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and splashing\r\n      with blood those near them.\nDólokhov—now an officer—wounded in the arm, and on foot, with\r\n      the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,\r\n      represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by the\r\n      crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in on\r\n      all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon\r\n      and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone behind\r\n      them, another fell in front and splashed Dólokhov with blood. The crowd,\r\n      pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few steps, and\r\n      again stopped.\n“Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here another\r\n      two minutes and it is certain death,” thought each one.\nDólokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of\r\n      the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the slippery\r\n      ice that covered the millpool.\n“Turn this way!” he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked under him;\r\n      “turn this way!” he shouted to those with the gun. “It bears!...”\nThe ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it would\r\n      give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even under his\r\n      weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the bank, hesitating to\r\n      step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the entrance to the dam\r\n      raised his hand and opened his mouth to address Dólokhov. Suddenly a\r\n      cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked. It flopped\r\n      into something moist, and the general fell from his horse in a pool of\r\n      blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him.\n“Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don’t you hear? Go on!”\r\n       innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general,\r\n      the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were shouting.\nOne of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the\r\n      ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond.\r\n      The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped\r\n      into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist. The\r\n      nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but from\r\n      behind still came the shouts: “Onto the ice, why do you stop? Go on! Go\r\n      on!” And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers near the\r\n      gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on.\r\n      The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under those on foot,\r\n      collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on it dashed, some\r\n      forward and some back, drowning one another.\nStill the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the\r\n      ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered\r\n      the dam, the pond, and the bank."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER XIX",
    "text": "On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his\r\n      hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkónski bleeding profusely and unconsciously\r\n      uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.\nToward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know\r\n      how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was\r\n      alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.\n“Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw today?”\r\n       was his first thought. “And I did not know this suffering either,” he\r\n      thought. “Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all till now. But\r\n      where am I?”\nHe listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices speaking\r\n      French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty sky with\r\n      clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and between them\r\n      gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not see those who,\r\n      judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up and stopped near\r\n      him.\nIt was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding over\r\n      the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing\r\n      at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the\r\n      field.\n“Fine men!” remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier, who,\r\n      with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his\r\n      stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.\n“The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your Majesty,” said\r\n      an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at Augesd.\n“Have some brought from the reserve,” said Napoleon, and having gone on a\r\n      few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with the\r\n      flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already been\r\n      taken by the French as a trophy.)\n“That’s a fine death!” said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkónski.\nPrince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was\r\n      Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed asSire. But he heard\r\n      the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only did they\r\n      not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them.\r\n      His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death, and he saw above\r\n      him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it was Napoleon—his\r\n      hero—but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small,\r\n      insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself\r\n      and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it. At that moment\r\n      it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, or what was said\r\n      of him; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only\r\n      wished that they would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed\r\n      to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so\r\n      differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound. He\r\n      feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused his\r\n      own pity.\n“Ah! He is alive,” said Napoleon. “Lift this young man up and carry him to\r\n      the dressing station.”\nHaving said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in\r\n      hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.\nPrince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the\r\n      terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while being\r\n      moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station. He did not\r\n      regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other wounded and\r\n      captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital. During this\r\n      transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even\r\n      speak.\nThe first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French\r\n      convoy officer, who said rapidly: “We must halt here: the Emperor will\r\n      pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen\r\n      prisoners.”\n“There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army, that he\r\n      is probably tired of them,” said another officer.\n“All the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor\r\n      Alexander’s Guards,” said the first one, indicating a Russian officer in\r\n      the white uniform of the Horse Guards.\nBolkónski recognized Prince Repnín whom he had met in Petersburg society.\r\n      Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of the Horse\r\n      Guards.\nBonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.\n“Which is the senior?” he asked, on seeing the prisoners.\nThey named the colonel, Prince Repnín.\n“You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander’s regiment of Horse\r\n      Guards?” asked Napoleon.\n“I commanded a squadron,” replied Repnín.\n“Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,” said Napoleon.\n“The praise of a great commander is a soldier’s highest reward,” said\r\n      Repnín.\n“I bestow it with pleasure,” said Napoleon. “And who is that young man\r\n      beside you?”\nPrince Repnín named Lieutenant Sukhtélen.\nAfter looking at him Napoleon smiled.\n“He’s very young to come to meddle with us.”\n“Youth is no hindrance to courage,” muttered Sukhtélen in a failing voice.\n“A splendid reply!” said Napoleon. “Young man, you will go far!”\nPrince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor’s eyes\r\n      to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his\r\n      attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield\r\n      and, addressing him, again used the epithet “young man” that was connected\r\n      in his memory with Prince Andrew.\n“Well, and you, young man,” said he. “How do you feel,mon brave?”\nThough five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words\r\n      to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed straight on\r\n      Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment seemed to him\r\n      all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself\r\n      with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty,\r\n      equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and understood, that he could\r\n      not answer him.\nEverything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern\r\n      and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood, suffering,\r\n      and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into Napoleon’s eyes\r\n      Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness, the unimportance\r\n      of life which no one could understand, and the still greater unimportance\r\n      of death, the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain.\nThe Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of\r\n      the officers as he went: “Have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my\r\n      bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds.Au revoir, Prince\r\n      Repnín!” and he spurred his horse and galloped away.\nHis face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.\nThe soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the\r\n      little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother’s neck, but\r\n      seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to\r\n      return the holy image.\nPrince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the little\r\n      icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his\r\n      uniform.\n“It would be good,” thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his sister\r\n      had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, “it would be good\r\n      if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary. How good it\r\n      would be to know where to seek for help in this life, and what to expect\r\n      after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I should be if I could now\r\n      say: ‘Lord, have mercy on me!’... But to whom should I say that? Either to\r\n      a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot address but\r\n      which I cannot even express in words—the Great All or Nothing-” said\r\n      he to himself, “or to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary!\r\n      There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of\r\n      everything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible\r\n      but all-important.”\nThe stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain; his\r\n      feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father, wife,\r\n      sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night before\r\n      the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and above all\r\n      this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies.\nThe quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented itself\r\n      to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that little Napoleon\r\n      had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight\r\n      at the misery of others, and doubts and torments had followed, and only\r\n      the heavens promised peace. Toward morning all these dreams melted and\r\n      merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in\r\n      the opinion of Napoleon’s doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in\r\n      death than in convalescence.\n“He is a nervous, bilious subject,” said Larrey, “and will not recover.”\nAnd Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of\r\n      the inhabitants of the district."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER I",
    "text": "Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostóv returned home on leave. Denísov was\r\n      going home to Vorónezh and Rostóv persuaded him to travel with him as far\r\n      as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at the last post\r\n      station but one before Moscow, Denísov had drunk three bottles of wine\r\n      with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the snow-covered road, did\r\n      not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh\r\n      beside Rostóv, who grew more and more impatient the nearer they got to\r\n      Moscow.\n“How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets, shops,\r\n      bakers’ signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!” thought Rostóv, when their\r\n      leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had entered\r\n      Moscow.\n“Denísov! We’re here! He’s asleep,” he added, leaning forward with his\r\n      whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the\r\n      sleigh.\nDenísov gave no answer.\n“There’s the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, Zakhár, has his\r\n      stand, and there’s Zakhár himself and still the same horse! And here’s the\r\n      little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can’t you hurry up? Now\r\n      then!”\n“Which house is it?” asked the driver.\n“Why, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don’t you see? That’s our\r\n      house,” said Rostóv. “Of course, it’s our house! Denísov, Denísov! We’re\r\n      almost there!”\nDenísov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.\n“Dmítri,” said Rostóv to his valet on the box, “those lights are in our\r\n      house, aren’t they?”\n“Yes, sir, and there’s a light in your father’s study.”\n“Then they’ve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now, don’t\r\n      forget to put out my new coat,” added Rostóv, fingering his new mustache.\r\n      “Now then, get on,” he shouted to the driver. “Do wake up, Váska!” he went\r\n      on, turning to Denísov, whose head was again nodding. “Come, get on! You\r\n      shall have three rubles for vodka—get on!” Rostóv shouted, when the\r\n      sleigh was only three houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses\r\n      were not moving at all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at\r\n      an entrance, and Rostóv saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit\r\n      of plaster broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the\r\n      pavement. He sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall.\r\n      The house stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to\r\n      it. There was no one in the hall. “Oh God! Is everyone all right?” he\r\n      thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then immediately\r\n      starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar\r\n      staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always angered the\r\n      countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely as ever. A\r\n      solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.\nOld Michael was asleep on the chest. Prokófy, the footman, who was so\r\n      strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat\r\n      plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening door\r\n      and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one of\r\n      delighted amazement.\n“Gracious heavens! The young count!” he cried, recognizing his young\r\n      master. “Can it be? My treasure!” and Prokófy, trembling with excitement,\r\n      rushed toward the drawing room door, probably in order to announce him,\r\n      but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the young man’s\r\n      shoulder.\n“All well?” asked Rostóv, drawing away his arm.\n“Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They’ve just finished supper. Let me have a\r\n      look at you, your excellency.”\n“Is everything quite all right?”\n“The Lord be thanked, yes!”\nRostóv, who had completely forgotten Denísov, not wishing anyone to\r\n      forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the large\r\n      dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card tables and\r\n      the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had already seen the\r\n      young master, and, before he had reached the drawing room, something flew\r\n      out from a side door like a tornado and began hugging and kissing him.\r\n      Another and yet another creature of the same kind sprang from a second\r\n      door and a third; more hugging, more kissing, more outcries, and tears of\r\n      joy. He could not distinguish which was Papa, which Natásha, and which\r\n      Pétya. Everyone shouted, talked, and kissed him at the same time. Only his\r\n      mother was not there, he noticed that.\n“And I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...”\n“Here he is... our own... Kólya, * dear fellow... How he has changed!...\r\n      Where are the candles?... Tea!...”\n* Nicholas.\n“And me, kiss me!”\n“Dearest... and me!”\nSónya, Natásha, Pétya, Anna Mikháylovna, Véra, and the old count were all\r\n      hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the room,\r\n      exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.\nPétya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, “And me too!”\nNatásha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face\r\n      with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and\r\n      pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly.\nAll around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around\r\n      were lips seeking a kiss.\nSónya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss, looked\r\n      eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she longed. Sónya\r\n      now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at this moment of\r\n      happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking her eyes off\r\n      him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave her a grateful look, but\r\n      was still expectant and looking for someone. The old countess had not yet\r\n      come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps so rapid that they could\r\n      hardly be his mother’s.\nYet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since he\r\n      had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her. When they met, she\r\n      fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her face, but only pressed\r\n      it to the cold braiding of his hussar’s jacket. Denísov, who had come into\r\n      the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped his eyes at the sight.\n“Vasíli Denísov, your son’s friend,” he said, introducing himself to the\r\n      count, who was looking inquiringly at him.\n“You are most welcome! I know, I know,” said the count, kissing and\r\n      embracing Denísov. “Nicholas wrote us... Natásha, Véra, look! Here is\r\n      Denísov!”\nThe same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of Denísov.\n“Darling Denísov!” screamed Natásha, beside herself with rapture,\r\n      springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This\r\n      escapade made everybody feel confused. Denísov blushed too, but smiled\r\n      and, taking Natásha’s hand, kissed it.\nDenísov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostóvs all\r\n      gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.\nThe old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every moment,\r\n      sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every movement,\r\n      word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him.\r\n      His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest to him and\r\n      disputed with one another who should bring him his tea, handkerchief, and\r\n      pipe.\nRostóv was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first moment of\r\n      meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed insufficient, and\r\n      he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.\nNext morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept\r\n      till ten o’clock.\nIn the room next to their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers, satchels,\r\n      sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly cleaned pairs\r\n      with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants were bringing in\r\n      jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their well-brushed clothes.\r\n      There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.\n“Hallo, Gwíska—my pipe!” came Vasíli Denísov’s husky voice. “Wostóv,\r\n      get up!”\nRostóv, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his disheveled\r\n      head from the hot pillow.\n“Why, is it late?”\n“Late! It’s nearly ten o’clock,” answered Natásha’s voice. A rustle of\r\n      starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls’ voices came\r\n      from the adjoining room. The door was opened a crack and there was a\r\n      glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair, and merry faces. It was\r\n      Natásha, Sónya, and Pétya, who had come to see whether they were getting\r\n      up.\n“Nicholas! Get up!” Natásha’s voice was again heard at the door.\n“Directly!”\nMeanwhile, Pétya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room,\r\n      with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and\r\n      forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,\r\n      opened the bedroom door.\n“Is this your saber?” he shouted.\nThe girls sprang aside. Denísov hid his hairy legs under the blanket,\r\n      looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door, having let\r\n      Pétya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from behind it.\n“Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!” said Natásha’s voice.\n“Is this your saber?” asked Pétya. “Or is it yours?” he said, addressing\r\n      the black-mustached Denísov with servile deference.\nRostóv hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown, and\r\n      went out. Natásha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting her\r\n      foot into the other. Sónya, when he came in, was twirling round and was\r\n      about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down. They were dressed\r\n      alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and bright.\r\n      Sónya ran away, but Natásha, taking her brother’s arm, led him into the\r\n      sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave one another time\r\n      to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters\r\n      which could not interest anyone but themselves. Natásha laughed at every\r\n      word he said or that she said herself, not because what they were saying\r\n      was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable to control her joy\r\n      which expressed itself by laughter.\n“Oh, how nice, how splendid!” she said to everything.\nRostóv felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that\r\n      childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left home\r\n      now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his soul and\r\n      his face.\n“No, but listen,” she said, “now you are quite a man, aren’t you? I’m\r\n      awfully glad you’re my brother.” She touched his mustache. “I want to know\r\n      what you men are like. Are you the same as we? No?”\n“Why did Sónya run away?” asked Rostóv.\n“Ah, yes! That’s a whole long story! How are you going to speak to\r\n      her—thouoryou?”\n“As may happen,” said Rostóv.\n“No, call heryou, please! I’ll tell you all about it some other time. No,\r\n      I’ll tell you now. You know Sónya’s my dearest friend. Such a friend that\r\n      I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!”\nShe pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long,\r\n      slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered\r\n      even by a ball dress.\n“I burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in the fire\r\n      and pressed it there!”\nSitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what used to\r\n      be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natásha’s wildly bright eyes,\r\n      Rostóv re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning\r\n      for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life; and the\r\n      burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him\r\n      senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it.\n“Well, and is that all?” he asked.\n“We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just\r\n      nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it\r\n      for life, but I don’t understand that, I forget quickly.”\n“Well, what then?”\n“Well, she loves me and you like that.”\nNatásha suddenly flushed.\n“Why, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are to\r\n      forget all that.... She says: ‘I shall love him always, but let him be\r\n      free.’ Isn’t that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isn’t it?” asked\r\n      Natásha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she was\r\n      now saying she had talked of before, with tears.\nRostóv became thoughtful.\n“I never go back on my word,” he said. “Besides, Sónya is so charming that\r\n      only a fool would renounce such happiness.”\n“No, no!” cried Natásha, “she and I have already talked it over. We knew\r\n      you’d say so. But it won’t do, because you see, if you say that—if\r\n      you consider yourself bound by your promise—it will seem as if she\r\n      had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying her\r\n      because you must, and that wouldn’t do at all.”\nRostóv saw that it had been well considered by them. Sónya had already\r\n      struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when he had caught a\r\n      glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl of\r\n      sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt that\r\n      for an instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry her,\r\n      Rostóv thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures and\r\n      interests before him! “Yes, they have taken a wise decision,” he thought,\r\n      “I must remain free.”\n“Well then, that’s excellent,” said he. “We’ll talk it over later on. Oh,\r\n      how glad I am to have you!”\n“Well, and are you still true to Borís?” he continued.\n“Oh, what nonsense!” cried Natásha, laughing. “I don’t think about him or\r\n      anyone else, and I don’t want anything of the kind.”\n“Dear me! Then what are you up to now?”\n“Now?” repeated Natásha, and a happy smile lit up her face. “Have you seen\r\n      Duport?”\n“No.”\n“Not seen Duport—the famous dancer? Well then, you won’t understand.\r\n      That’s what I’m up to.”\nCurving her arms, Natásha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran back a\r\n      few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply together,\r\n      and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.\n“See, I’m standing! See!” she said, but could not maintain herself on her\r\n      toes any longer. “So that’s what I’m up to! I’ll never marry anyone, but\r\n      will be a dancer. Only don’t tell anyone.”\nRostóv laughed so loud and merrily that Denísov, in his bedroom, felt\r\n      envious and Natásha could not help joining in.\n“No, but don’t you think it’s nice?” she kept repeating.\n“Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Borís?”\nNatásha flared up. “I don’t want to marry anyone. And I’ll tell him so\r\n      when I see him!”\n“Dear me!” said Rostóv.\n“But that’s all rubbish,” Natásha chattered on. “And is Denísov nice?” she\r\n      asked.\n“Yes, indeed!”\n“Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible, Denísov?”\n“Why terrible?” asked Nicholas. “No, Váska is a splendid fellow.”\n“You call him Váska? That’s funny! And is he very nice?”\n“Very.”\n“Well then, be quick. We’ll all have breakfast together.”\nAnd Natásha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet dancer,\r\n      but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When Rostóv met\r\n      Sónya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know how to behave with\r\n      her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of meeting, they had\r\n      kissed each other, but today they felt it could not be done; he felt that\r\n      everybody, including his mother and sisters, was looking inquiringly at\r\n      him and watching to see how he would behave with her. He kissed her hand\r\n      and addressed her not asthoubut asyou—Sónya. But their eyes met\r\n      and saidthou, and exchanged tender kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive\r\n      her for having dared, by Natásha’s intermediacy, to remind him of his\r\n      promise, and then thanked him for his love. His looks thanked her for\r\n      offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would\r\n      never cease to love her, for that would be impossible.\n“How strange it is,” said Véra, selecting a moment when all were silent,\r\n      “that Sónya and Nicholas now sayyouto one another and meet like\r\n      strangers.”\nVéra’s remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like most of\r\n      her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only Sónya,\r\n      Nicholas, and Natásha, but even the old countess, who—dreading this\r\n      love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making a brilliant match—blushed\r\n      like a girl.\nDenísov, to Rostóv’s surprise, appeared in the drawing room with pomaded\r\n      hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as he made\r\n      himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the ladies and\r\n      gentlemen than Rostóv had ever expected to see him."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER II",
    "text": "On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostóv was welcomed by his\r\n      home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling Nikólenka; by\r\n      his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young man; by his\r\n      acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good dancer, and one\r\n      of the best matches in the city.\nThe Rostóvs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough that\r\n      year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas, acquiring\r\n      a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut, such\r\n      as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the latest fashion, with\r\n      extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs, passed his time very gaily.\r\n      After a short period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life,\r\n      Nicholas found it very pleasant to be at home again. He felt that he had\r\n      grown up and matured very much. His despair at failing in a Scripture\r\n      examination, his borrowing money from Gavríl to pay a sleigh driver, his\r\n      kissing Sónya on the sly—he now recalled all this as childishness he\r\n      had left immeasurably behind. Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a\r\n      jacket laced with silver, and wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to\r\n      soldiers for bravery in action, and in the company of well-known, elderly,\r\n      and respected racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He\r\n      knew a lady on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led\r\n      the mazurka at the Arkhárovs’ ball, talked about the war with Field\r\n      Marshal Kámenski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with\r\n      a colonel of forty to whom Denísov had introduced him.\nHis passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But still, as\r\n      he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke\r\n      about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he had\r\n      not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the Emperor\r\n      not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared the\r\n      adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of as the\r\n      “angel incarnate.”\nDuring Rostóv’s short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he did\r\n      not draw closer to Sónya, but rather drifted away from her. She was very\r\n      pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was at the\r\n      period of youth when there seems so much to do that there isno timefor\r\n      that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes his\r\n      freedom which he needs for so many other things. When he thought of Sónya,\r\n      during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself, “Ah, there will be, and\r\n      there are, many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet know. There\r\n      will be time enough to think about love when I want to, but now I have no\r\n      time.” Besides, it seemed to him that the society of women was rather\r\n      derogatory to his manhood. He went to balls and into ladies’ society with\r\n      an affectation of doing so against his will. The races, the English Club,\r\n      sprees with Denísov, and visits to a certain house—that was another\r\n      matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar!\nAt the beginning of March, old Count Ilyá Rostóv was very busy arranging a\r\n      dinner in honor of Prince Bagratión at the English Club.\nThe count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving orders\r\n      to the club steward and to the famous Feoktíst, the club’s head cook,\r\n      about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and fish for this\r\n      dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee of the club from\r\n      the day it was founded. To him the club entrusted the arrangement of the\r\n      festival in honor of Bagratión, for few men knew so well how to arrange a\r\n      feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale, and still fewer men would be so\r\n      well able and willing to make up out of their own resources what might be\r\n      needed for the success of the fete. The club cook and the steward listened\r\n      to the count’s orders with pleased faces, for they knew that under no\r\n      other management could they so easily extract a good profit for themselves\r\n      from a dinner costing several thousand rubles.\n“Well then, mind and have cocks’ comb in the turtle soup, you know!”\n“Shall we have three cold dishes then?” asked the cook.\nThe count considered.\n“We can’t have less—yes, three... the mayonnaise, that’s one,” said\r\n      he, bending down a finger.\n“Then am I to order those large sterlets?” asked the steward.\n“Yes, it can’t be helped if they won’t take less. Ah, dear me! I was\r\n      forgetting. We must have another entrée. Ah, goodness gracious!” he\r\n      clutched at his head. “Who is going to get me the flowers? Dmítri! Eh,\r\n      Dmítri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate,” he said to the factotum who\r\n      appeared at his call. “Hurry off and tell Maksím, the gardener, to set the\r\n      serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must be brought\r\n      here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred pots here on\r\n      Friday.”\nHaving given several more orders, he was about to go to his “little\r\n      countess” to have a rest, but remembering something else of importance, he\r\n      returned again, called back the cook and the club steward, and again began\r\n      giving orders. A light footstep and the clinking of spurs were heard at\r\n      the door, and the young count, handsome, rosy, with a dark little\r\n      mustache, evidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in Moscow,\r\n      entered the room.\n“Ah, my boy, my head’s in a whirl!” said the old man with a smile, as if\r\n      he felt a little confused before his son. “Now, if you would only help a\r\n      bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own orchestra, but shouldn’t\r\n      we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like that sort of\r\n      thing.”\n“Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagratión worried himself less before the\r\n      battle of Schön Grabern than you do now,” said his son with a smile.\nThe old count pretended to be angry.\n“Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!”\nAnd the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful\r\n      expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and son.\n“What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktíst?” said he.\r\n      “Laughing at us old fellows!”\n“That’s so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good dinner,\r\n      but providing it and serving it all up, that’s not their business!”\n“That’s it, that’s it!” exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing his son by\r\n      both hands, he cried, “Now I’ve got you, so take the sleigh and pair at\r\n      once, and go to Bezúkhov’s, and tell him ‘Count Ilyá has sent you to ask\r\n      for strawberries and fresh pineapples.’ We can’t get them from anyone\r\n      else. He’s not there himself, so you’ll have to go in and ask the\r\n      princesses; and from there go on to the Rasgulyáy—the coachman\r\n      Ipátka knows—and look up the gypsy Ilyúshka, the one who danced at\r\n      Count Orlóv’s, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along\r\n      to me.”\n“And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?” asked Nicholas,\r\n      laughing. “Dear, dear!...”\nAt that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike,\r\n      preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his\r\n      dressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to\r\n      excuse his costume.\n“No matter at all, my dear count,” she said, meekly closing her eyes. “But\r\n      I’ll go to Bezúkhov’s myself. Pierre has arrived, and now we shall get\r\n      anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him in any case. He has\r\n      forwarded me a letter from Borís. Thank God, Borís is now on the staff.”\nThe count was delighted at Anna Mikháylovna’s taking upon herself one of\r\n      his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.\n“Tell Bezúkhov to come. I’ll put his name down. Is his wife with him?” he\r\n      asked.\nAnna Mikháylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted on\r\n      her face.\n“Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,” she said. “If what we hear\r\n      is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing when we\r\n      were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul as young\r\n      Bezúkhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give him what\r\n      consolation I can.”\n“Wh-what is the matter?” asked both the young and old Rostóv.\nAnna Mikháylovna sighed deeply.\n“Dólokhov, Mary Ivánovna’s son,” she said in a mysterious whisper, “has\r\n      compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him up, invited him to\r\n      his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here and that daredevil\r\n      after her!” said Anna Mikháylovna, wishing to show her sympathy for\r\n      Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her\r\n      sympathy for the “daredevil,” as she called Dólokhov. “They say Pierre is\r\n      quite broken by his misfortune.”\n“Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the club—it will all blow\r\n      over. It will be a tremendous banquet.”\nNext day, the third of March, soon after one o’clock, two hundred and\r\n      fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest\r\n      of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagratión, to dinner.\nOn the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had\r\n      been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories that\r\n      on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it, while\r\n      others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event. In\r\n      the English Club, where all who were distinguished, important, and well\r\n      informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in December, nothing\r\n      was said about the war and the last battle, as though all were in a\r\n      conspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone in conversation—Count\r\n      Rostopchín, Prince Yúri Dolgorúkov, Valúev, Count Markóv, and Prince\r\n      Vyázemski—did not show themselves at the club, but met in private\r\n      houses in intimate circles, and the Moscovites who took their opinions\r\n      from others—Ilyá Rostóv among them—remained for a while\r\n      without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without\r\n      leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss\r\n      the bad news was difficult, and so it was best to be silent. But after a\r\n      while, just as a jury comes out of its room, the bigwigs who guided the\r\n      club’s opinion reappeared, and everybody began speaking clearly and\r\n      definitely. Reasons were found for the incredible, unheard-of, and\r\n      impossible event of a Russian defeat, everything became clear, and in all\r\n      corners of Moscow the same things began to be said. These reasons were the\r\n      treachery of the Austrians, a defective commissariat, the treachery of the\r\n      Pole Przebyszéwski and of the Frenchman Langeron, Kutúzov’s incapacity,\r\n      and (it was whispered) the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who\r\n      had trusted worthless and insignificant people. But the army, the Russian\r\n      army, everyone declared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of\r\n      valor. The soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of\r\n      heroes was Prince Bagratión, distinguished by his Schön Grabern affair and\r\n      by the retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column\r\n      unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as\r\n      his own. What also conduced to Bagratión’s being selected as Moscow’s hero\r\n      was the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger\r\n      there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier\r\n      without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated by\r\n      memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suvórov. Moreover,\r\n      paying such honor to Bagratión was the best way of expressing disapproval\r\n      and dislike of Kutúzov.\n“Had there been no Bagratión, it would have been necessary to invent him,”\r\n       said the wit Shinshín, parodying the words of Voltaire. Kutúzov no one\r\n      spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers, calling him a court\r\n      weathercock and an old satyr.\nAll Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorúkov’s saying: “If you go on modeling and\r\n      modeling you must get smeared with clay,” suggesting consolation for our\r\n      defeat by the memory of former victories; and the words of Rostopchín,\r\n      that French soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words,\r\n      and Germans by logical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to\r\n      run away than to advance, but that Russian soldiers only need to be\r\n      restrained and held back! On all sides, new and fresh anecdotes were heard\r\n      of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and men at\r\n      Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another had killed five Frenchmen, a\r\n      third had loaded five cannon singlehanded. Berg was mentioned, by those\r\n      who did not know him, as having, when wounded in the right hand, taken his\r\n      sword in the left, and gone forward. Of Bolkónski, nothing was said, and\r\n      only those who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young,\r\n      leaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric father."

    "text": "On that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were filled with\r\n      a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in springtime. The\r\n      members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat, stood,\r\n      met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress, and a few\r\n      here and there with powdered hair and in Russiankaftáns. Powdered\r\n      footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings, stood at every\r\n      door anxiously noting visitors’ every movement in order to offer their\r\n      services. Most of those present were elderly, respected men with broad,\r\n      self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures and voices. This\r\n      class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in\r\n      certain habitual groups. A minority of those present were casual guests—chiefly\r\n      young men, among whom were Denísov, Rostóv, and Dólokhov—who was now\r\n      again an officer in the Semënov regiment. The faces of these young people,\r\n      especially those who were military men, bore that expression of\r\n      condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older\r\n      generation, “We are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the same\r\n      remember that the future belongs to us.”\nNesvítski was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who at his\r\n      wife’s command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles, went\r\n      about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here, as\r\n      elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his\r\n      wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he treated\r\n      them with absent-minded contempt.\nBy his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his wealth\r\n      and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests, and\r\n      so he went from one group to another. Some of the most important old men\r\n      were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully to\r\n      hear the voices of well-known men. The largest circles formed round Count\r\n      Rostopchín, Valúev, and Narýshkin. Rostopchín was describing how the\r\n      Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force\r\n      their way through them with bayonets.\nValúev was confidentially telling that Uvárov had been sent from\r\n      Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.\nIn the third circle, Narýshkin was speaking of the meeting of the Austrian\r\n      Council of War at which Suvórov crowed like a cock in reply to the\r\n      nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. Shinshín, standing close by,\r\n      tried to make a joke, saying that Kutúzov had evidently failed to learn\r\n      from Suvórov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a cock, but\r\n      the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him feel that in\r\n      that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of Kutúzov.\nCount Ilyá Rostóv, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft boots\r\n      between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the important and\r\n      unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all equals, while his\r\n      eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up young son, resting on\r\n      him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rostóv stood at a window with\r\n      Dólokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued. The old\r\n      count came up to them and pressed Dólokhov’s hand.\n“Please come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been together out\r\n      there... both playing the hero... Ah, Vasíli Ignátovich... How d’ye do,\r\n      old fellow?” he said, turning to an old man who was passing, but before he\r\n      had finished his greeting there was a general stir, and a footman who had\r\n      run in announced, with a frightened face: “He’s arrived!”\nBells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and—like rye shaken\r\n      together in a shovel—the guests who had been scattered about in\r\n      different rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the\r\n      door of the ballroom.\nBagratión appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword,\r\n      which, in accord with the club custom, he had given up to the hall porter.\r\n      He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip over his\r\n      shoulder, as when Rostóv had seen him on the eve of the battle of\r\n      Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign Orders,\r\n      and the Star of St. George on his left breast. Evidently just before\r\n      coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed, which\r\n      changed his appearance for the worse. There was something naïvely festive\r\n      in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile features, gave\r\n      him a rather comical expression. Bekleshëv and Theodore Uvárov, who had\r\n      arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him, as the guest of\r\n      honor, to enter first. Bagratión was embarrassed, not wishing to avail\r\n      himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay at the doors, but\r\n      after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly and awkwardly over\r\n      the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing what to do with his\r\n      hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire, as\r\n      he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at Schön Grabern—and\r\n      he would have found that easier. The committeemen met him at the first\r\n      door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest,\r\n      took possession of him as it were, without waiting for his reply,\r\n      surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was at first\r\n      impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of members and\r\n      guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagratión\r\n      over each other’s shoulders, as if he were some rare animal. Count Ilyá\r\n      Rostóv, laughing and repeating the words, “Make way, dear boy! Make way,\r\n      make way!” pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone, led\r\n      the guests into the drawing room, and seated them on the center sofa. The\r\n      bigwigs, the most respected members of the club, beset the new arrivals.\r\n      Count Ilyá, again thrusting his way through the crowd, went out of the\r\n      drawing room and reappeared a minute later with another committeeman,\r\n      carrying a large silver salver which he presented to Prince Bagratión. On\r\n      the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the hero’s honor.\r\n      Bagratión, on seeing the salver, glanced around in dismay, as though\r\n      seeking help. But all eyes demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself\r\n      in their power, he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked\r\n      sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him.\r\n      Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagratión (or he would, it seemed,\r\n      have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his\r\n      attention to the verses.\n“Well, I will read them, then!” Bagratión seemed to say, and, fixing his\r\n      weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and serious\r\n      expression. But the author himself took the verses and began reading them\r\n      aloud. Bagratión bowed his head and listened:\nBring glory then to Alexander’s reignAnd on the throne our Titus shield.A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!E’en fortunate NapoleonKnows by experience, now, Bagratión,And dare not Herculean Russians trouble...\nBut before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced that\r\n      dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room came the\r\n      resounding strains of the polonaise:\nConquest’s joyful thunder waken,Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...\nand Count Rostóv, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his\r\n      verses, bowed to Bagratión. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was more\r\n      important than verses, and Bagratión, again preceding all the rest, went\r\n      in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between two Alexanders—Bekleshëv\r\n      and Narýshkin—which was a significant allusion to the name of the\r\n      sovereign. Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room,\r\n      according to their rank and importance: the more important nearer to the\r\n      honored guest, as naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies\r\n      lowest.\nJust before dinner, Count Ilyá Rostóv presented his son to Bagratión, who\r\n      recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward, as\r\n      were all the words he spoke that day, and Count Ilyá looked joyfully and\r\n      proudly around while Bagratión spoke to his son.\nNicholas Rostóv, with Denísov and his new acquaintance, Dólokhov, sat\r\n      almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince\r\n      Nesvítski. Count Ilyá Rostóv with the other members of the committee sat\r\n      facing Bagratión and, as the very personification of Moscow hospitality,\r\n      did the honors to the prince.\nHis efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the\r\n      other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the end\r\n      of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the footmen,\r\n      and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything was\r\n      excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of which\r\n      Ilyá Rostóv blushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen began\r\n      popping corks and filling the champagne glasses. After the fish, which\r\n      made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with the other\r\n      committeemen. “There will be many toasts, it’s time to begin,” he\r\n      whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. All were silent, waiting for\r\n      what he would say.\n“To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!” he cried, and at the same\r\n      moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm. The\r\n      band immediately struck up “Conquest’s joyful thunder waken...” All rose\r\n      and cried “Hurrah!” Bagratión also rose and shouted “Hurrah!” in exactly\r\n      the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schön Grabern.\r\n      Young Rostóv’s ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred\r\n      others. He nearly wept. “To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!” he\r\n      roared, “Hurrah!” and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the\r\n      floor. Many followed his example, and the loud shouting continued for a\r\n      long time. When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken\r\n      glass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and\r\n      exchanging remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying\r\n      beside his plate, and proposed a toast, “To the health of the hero of our\r\n      last campaign, Prince Peter Ivánovich Bagratión!” and again his blue eyes\r\n      grew moist. “Hurrah!” cried the three hundred voices again, but instead of\r\n      the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul Ivánovich\r\n      Kutúzov:\nRussians! O’er all barriers on!Courage conquest guarantees;Have we not Bagratión?He brings foemen to their knees,... etc.\nAs soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed\r\n      and Count Ilyá Rostóv became more and more moved, more glass was smashed,\r\n      and the shouting grew louder. They drank to Bekleshëv, Narýshkin, Uvárov,\r\n      Dolgorúkov, Apráksin, Valúev, to the committee, to all the club members\r\n      and to all the club guests, and finally to Count Ilyá Rostóv separately,\r\n      as the organizer of the banquet. At that toast, the count took out his\r\n      handkerchief and, covering his face, wept outright."

    "text": "Pierre sat opposite Dólokhov and Nicholas Rostóv. As usual, he ate and\r\n      drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed that\r\n      some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through\r\n      dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and a\r\n      look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his nose.\r\n      His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear nothing of\r\n      what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and\r\n      unsolved problem.\nThe unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the\r\n      princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning Dólokhov’s intimacy with his\r\n      wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which in\r\n      the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly\r\n      through his spectacles, but that his wife’s connection with Dólokhov was a\r\n      secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the\r\n      princess’ hints and the letter, but he feared now to look at Dólokhov, who\r\n      was sitting opposite him. Every time he chanced to meet Dólokhov’s\r\n      handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous\r\n      rising in his soul and turned quickly away. Involuntarily recalling his\r\n      wife’s past and her relations with Dólokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what\r\n      was said in the letter might be true, or might at least seem to be true\r\n      had it not referred tohis wife. He involuntarily remembered how Dólokhov,\r\n      who had fully recovered his former position after the campaign, had\r\n      returned to Petersburg and come to him. Availing himself of his friendly\r\n      relations with Pierre as a boon companion, Dólokhov had come straight to\r\n      his house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled\r\n      how Hélène had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dólokhov’s living at\r\n      their house, and how cynically Dólokhov had praised his wife’s beauty to\r\n      him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a\r\n      day.\n“Yes, he is very handsome,” thought Pierre, “and I know him. It would be\r\n      particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me, just\r\n      because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him, and helped\r\n      him. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure of\r\n      deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true, but I do not\r\n      believe it. I have no right to, and can’t, believe it.” He remembered the\r\n      expression Dólokhov’s face assumed in his moments of cruelty, as when\r\n      tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water, or when\r\n      he challenged a man to a duel without any reason, or shot a post-boy’s\r\n      horse with a pistol. That expression was often on Dólokhov’s face when\r\n      looking at him. “Yes, he is a bully,” thought Pierre, “to kill a man means\r\n      nothing to him. It must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and\r\n      that must please him. He must think that I, too, am afraid of him—and\r\n      in fact I am afraid of him,” he thought, and again he felt something\r\n      terrible and monstrous rising in his soul. Dólokhov, Denísov, and Rostóv\r\n      were now sitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rostóv was talking\r\n      merrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other\r\n      a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically\r\n      at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very\r\n      noticeable one at the dinner. Rostóv looked inimically at Pierre, first\r\n      because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband\r\n      of a beauty, and in a word—an old woman; and secondly because Pierre\r\n      in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostóv and\r\n      had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor’s health was drunk,\r\n      Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.\n“What are you about?” shouted Rostóv, looking at him in an ecstasy of\r\n      exasperation. “Don’t you hear it’s His Majesty the Emperor’s health?”\nPierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till all\r\n      were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rostóv.\n“Why, I didn’t recognize you!” he said. But Rostóv was otherwise engaged;\r\n      he was shouting “Hurrah!”\n“Why don’t you renew the acquaintance?” said Dólokhov to Rostóv.\n“Confound him, he’s a fool!” said Rostóv.\n“One should make up to the husbands of pretty women,” said Denísov.\nPierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking\r\n      about him. He reddened and turned away.\n“Well, now to the health of handsome women!” said Dólokhov, and with a\r\n      serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth,\r\n      he turned with his glass to Pierre.\n“Here’s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin—and their lovers!”\r\n       he added.\nPierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at\r\n      Dólokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets with\r\n      Kutúzov’s cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the principal guests.\r\n      He was just going to take it when Dólokhov, leaning across, snatched it\r\n      from his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked at Dólokhov and his eyes\r\n      dropped, the something terrible and monstrous that had tormented him all\r\n      dinnertime rose and took possession of him. He leaned his whole massive\r\n      body across the table.\n“How dare you take it?” he shouted.\nHearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvítski and the\r\n      neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezúkhov.\n“Don’t! Don’t! What are you about?” whispered their frightened voices.\nDólokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that smile\r\n      of his which seemed to say, “Ah! This is what I like!”\n“You shan’t have it!” he said distinctly.\nPale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.\n“You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!” he ejaculated, and, pushing\r\n      back his chair, he rose from the table.\nAt the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt that\r\n      the question of his wife’s guilt which had been tormenting him the whole\r\n      day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative. He hated her\r\n      and was forever sundered from her. Despite Denísov’s request that he would\r\n      take no part in the matter, Rostóv agreed to be Dólokhov’s second, and\r\n      after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with Nesvítski,\r\n      Bezúkhov’s second. Pierre went home, but Rostóv with Dólokhov and Denísov\r\n      stayed on at the club till late, listening to the gypsies and other\r\n      singers.\n“Well then, till tomorrow at Sokólniki,” said Dólokhov, as he took leave\r\n      of Rostóv in the club porch.\n“And do you feel quite calm?” Rostóv asked.\nDólokhov paused.\n“Well, you see, I’ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words. If\r\n      you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write affectionate\r\n      letters to your parents, and if you think you may be killed, you are a\r\n      fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm intention of killing\r\n      your man as quickly and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as\r\n      our bear huntsman at Kostromá used to tell me. ‘Everyone fears a bear,’ he\r\n      says, ‘but when you see one your fear’s all gone, and your only thought is\r\n      not to let him get away!’ And that’s how it is with me.À demain, mon\r\n      cher.” *\n* Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.\nNext day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvítski drove to the\r\n      Sokólniki forest and found Dólokhov, Denísov, and Rostóv already there.\r\n      Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no\r\n      connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow. He had\r\n      evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and screwed\r\n      up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed by two\r\n      considerations: his wife’s guilt, of which after his sleepless night he\r\n      had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of Dólokhov, who had no\r\n      reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him.... “I should\r\n      perhaps have done the same thing in his place,” thought Pierre. “It’s even\r\n      certain that I should have done the same, then why this duel, this murder?\r\n      Either I shall kill him, or he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee.\r\n      Can’t I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?” passed\r\n      through his mind. But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him,\r\n      he would ask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired\r\n      the respect of the onlookers, “Will it be long? Are things ready?”\nWhen all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers, and\r\n      the pistols loaded, Nesvítski went up to Pierre.\n“I should not be doing my duty, Count,” he said in timid tones, “and\r\n      should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in\r\n      choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment I\r\n      did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no sufficient ground\r\n      for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it.... You were not right,\r\n      not quite in the right, you were impetuous...”\n“Oh yes, it is horribly stupid,” said Pierre.\n“Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent will\r\n      accept them,” said Nesvítski (who like the others concerned in the affair,\r\n      and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that the affair\r\n      had come to an actual duel). “You know, Count, it is much more honorable\r\n      to admit one’s mistake than to let matters become irreparable. There was\r\n      no insult on either side. Allow me to convey....”\n“No! What is there to talk about?” said Pierre. “It’s all the same.... Is\r\n      everything ready?” he added. “Only tell me where to go and where to\r\n      shoot,” he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.\nHe took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the\r\n      trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand—a fact that\r\n      he did not wish to confess.\n“Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,” said he.\n“No apologies, none whatever,” said Dólokhov to Denísov (who on his side\r\n      had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to the\r\n      appointed place.\nThe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road, where\r\n      the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest covered\r\n      with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the last few\r\n      days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther edge of the\r\n      clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in the deep wet\r\n      snow between the place where they had been standing and Nesvítski’s and\r\n      Dólokhov’s sabers, which were stuck into the ground ten paces apart to\r\n      mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at forty paces’ distance\r\n      nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had been ready, but they\r\n      still delayed and all were silent."

    "text": "“Well, begin!” said Dólokhov.\n“All right,” said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling of\r\n      dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun\r\n      could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of\r\n      men’s will.\nDenísov first went to the barrier and announced: “As the adve’sawies have\r\n      wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your pistols, and at the\r\n      wordthweebegin to advance.\n“O-ne! T-wo! Thwee!” he shouted angrily and stepped aside.\nThe combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to one\r\n      another, beginning to see one another through the mist. They had the right\r\n      to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. Dólokhov walked\r\n      slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his bright,\r\n      sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist’s face. His mouth wore its usual\r\n      semblance of a smile.\n“So I can fire when I like!” said Pierre, and at the word “three,” he went\r\n      quickly forward, missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow.\r\n      He held the pistol in his right hand at arm’s length, apparently afraid of\r\n      shooting himself with it. His left hand he held carefully back, because he\r\n      wished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so.\r\n      Having advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre\r\n      looked down at his feet, then quickly glanced at Dólokhov and, bending his\r\n      finger as he had been shown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report,\r\n      Pierre shuddered at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations,\r\n      stood still. The smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from\r\n      seeing anything for an instant, but there was no second report as he had\r\n      expected. He only heard Dólokhov’s hurried steps, and his figure came in\r\n      view through the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his left side, while\r\n      the other clutched his drooping pistol. His face was pale. Rostóv ran\r\n      toward him and said something.\n“No-o-o!” muttered Dólokhov through his teeth, “no, it’s not over.” And\r\n      after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber, he sank on\r\n      the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped it on his coat and\r\n      supported himself with it. His frowning face was pallid and quivered.\n“Plea...” began Dólokhov, but could not at first pronounce the word.\n“Please,” he uttered with an effort.\nPierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward Dólokhov and was\r\n      about to cross the space between the barriers, when Dólokhov cried:\n“To your barrier!” and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by his\r\n      saber. Only ten paces divided them. Dólokhov lowered his head to the snow,\r\n      greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself, drew in his\r\n      legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked and swallowed\r\n      the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still smiling, glittered\r\n      with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining strength. He\r\n      raised his pistol and aimed.\n“Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!” ejaculated Nesvítski.\n“Cover yourself!” even Denísov cried to his adversary.\nPierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs\r\n      helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing Dólokhov\r\n      and looked sorrowfully at him. Denísov, Rostóv, and Nesvítski closed their\r\n      eyes. At the same instant they heard a report and Dólokhov’s angry cry.\n“Missed!” shouted Dólokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards on the\r\n      snow.\nPierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,\r\n      trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:\n“Folly... folly! Death... lies...” he repeated, puckering his face.\nNesvítski stopped him and took him home.\nRostóv and Denísov drove away with the wounded Dólokhov.\nThe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer a\r\n      word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering Moscow he suddenly\r\n      came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rostóv, who was sitting\r\n      beside him, by the hand. Rostóv was struck by the totally altered and\r\n      unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on Dólokhov’s face.\n“Well? How do you feel?” he asked.\n“Bad! But it’s not that, my friend—” said Dólokhov with a\r\n      gasping voice. “Where are we? In Moscow, I know. I don’t matter, but I\r\n      have killed her, killed... She won’t get over it! She won’t survive....”\n“Who?” asked Rostóv.\n“My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,” and Dólokhov\r\n      pressed Rostóv’s hand and burst into tears.\nWhen he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rostóv that he was\r\n      living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it.\r\n      He implored Rostóv to go on and prepare her.\nRostóv went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise\r\n      learned that Dólokhov the brawler, Dólokhov the bully, lived in Moscow\r\n      with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate\r\n      of sons and brothers."

    "text": "Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in\r\n      Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the duel\r\n      he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his\r\n      father’s room, that huge room in which Count Bezúkhov had died.\nHe lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had\r\n      happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings, thoughts,\r\n      and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep, nor\r\n      even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the room with rapid\r\n      steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage, with\r\n      bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on her face, and then\r\n      immediately he saw beside her Dólokhov’s handsome, insolent, hard, and\r\n      mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and then that same face\r\n      pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when he reeled and sank on\r\n      the snow.\n“What has happened?” he asked himself. “I have killed herlover, yes,\r\n      killed my wife’s lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come to do\r\n      it?”—“Because you married her,” answered an inner voice.\n“But in what was I to blame?” he asked. “In marrying her without loving\r\n      her; in deceiving yourself and her.” And he vividly recalled that moment\r\n      after supper at Prince Vasíli’s, when he spoke those words he had found so\r\n      difficult to utter: “I love you.” “It all comes from that! Even then I\r\n      felt it,” he thought. “I felt then that it was not so, that I had no right\r\n      to do it. And so it turns out.”\nHe remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection. Particularly\r\n      vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon\r\n      after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little\r\n      before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there,\r\n      who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at his dressing gown\r\n      and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful understanding of his\r\n      employer’s happiness.\n“But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty and\r\n      social tact,” thought he; “been proud of my house, in which she received\r\n      all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty. So this is what\r\n      I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand her. How often\r\n      when considering her character I have told myself that I was to blame for\r\n      not understanding her, for not understanding that constant composure and\r\n      complacency and lack of all interests or desires, and the whole secret\r\n      lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman. Now I have spoken\r\n      that terrible word to myself all has become clear.\n“Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her naked\r\n      shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be kissed. Her\r\n      father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied with a calm\r\n      smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: ‘Let him do what he\r\n      pleases,’ she used to say of me. One day I asked her if she felt any\r\n      symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a\r\n      fool to want to have children, and that she was not going to have any\r\n      children byme.”\nThen he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the\r\n      vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had been\r\n      brought up in the most aristocratic circles.\n“I’m not such a fool.... Just you try it on....Allez-vous promener,” *\r\n      she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with young and old men\r\n      and women Pierre could not understand why he did not love her.\n* “You clear out of this.”\n“Yes, I never loved her,” said he to himself; “I knew she was a depraved\r\n      woman,” he repeated, “but dared not admit it to myself. And now there’s\r\n      Dólokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying, while\r\n      meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!”\nPierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what is\r\n      called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. He\r\n      digested his sufferings alone.\n“It is all, all her fault,” he said to himself; “but what of that? Why did\r\n      I bind myself to her? Why did I say‘Je vous aime’* to her, which was a\r\n      lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure... what? A slur on\r\n      my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that’s nonsense,” he thought. “The\r\n      slur on my name and honor—that’s all apart from myself.”\n* I love you.\n“Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a\r\n      criminal,” came into Pierre’s head, “and from their point of view they\r\n      were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr’s death\r\n      for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot. Who is\r\n      right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are alive—live: tomorrow\r\n      you’ll die as I might have died an hour ago. And is it worth tormenting\r\n      oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?”\nBut at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections,shesuddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most\r\n      strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the blood rush\r\n      to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break and tear\r\n      whatever came to his hand. “Why did I tell her that‘Je vous aime’?” he\r\n      kept repeating to himself. And when he had said it for the tenth time,\r\n      Molière’s words:“Mais que diable allait-il faire dans cette galère?”*\r\n      occurred to him, and he began to laugh at himself.\n* “But what the devil was he doing in that galley?”\nIn the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to\r\n      Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He\r\n      resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his\r\n      intention to part from her forever.\nNext morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre was\r\n      lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.\nHe woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression, unable\r\n      to realize where he was.\n“The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home,”\r\n       said the valet.\nBut before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess\r\n      herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with\r\n      simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a\r\n      coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was a\r\n      wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow. With her\r\n      imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet. She\r\n      knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. She waited till the valet\r\n      had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked at her\r\n      timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays\r\n      back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies, he\r\n      tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless and\r\n      impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down but\r\n      looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to go.\n“Well, what’s this now? What have you been up to now, I should like to\r\n      know?” she asked sternly.\n“I? What have I...?” stammered Pierre.\n“So it seems you’re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about? What\r\n      is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.”\nPierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but could\r\n      not reply.\n“If you won’t answer, I’ll tell you...” Hélène went on. “You believe\r\n      everything you’re told. You were told...” Hélène laughed, “that Dólokhov\r\n      was my lover,” she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech,\r\n      uttering the wordamantas casually as any other word, “and you believed\r\n      it! Well, what have you proved? What does this duel prove? That you’re a\r\n      fool,que vous êtes un sot, but everybody knew that. What will be the\r\n      result? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone\r\n      will say that you, drunk and not knowing what you were about, challenged a\r\n      man you are jealous of without cause.” Hélène raised her voice and became\r\n      more and more excited, “A man who’s a better man than you in every way...”\n“Hm... Hm...!” growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and not\r\n      moving a muscle.\n“And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his\r\n      company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer yours.”\n“Don’t speak to me... I beg you,” muttered Pierre hoarsely.\n“Why shouldn’t I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you plainly that\r\n      there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have\r\n      taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,” said she.\nPierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange\r\n      expression she did not understand, and lay down again. He was suffering\r\n      physically at that moment, there was a weight on his chest and he could\r\n      not breathe. He knew that he must do something to put an end to this\r\n      suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.\n“We had better separate,” he muttered in a broken voice.\n“Separate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,” said Hélène.\r\n      “Separate! That’s a thing to frighten me with!”\nPierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.\n“I’ll kill you!” he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table with a\r\n      strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her brandishing\r\n      the slab.\nHélène’s face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His father’s\r\n      nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and delight of\r\n      frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping down on her with\r\n      outstretched hands shouted, “Get out!” in such a terrible voice that the\r\n      whole house heard it with horror. God knows what he would have done at\r\n      that moment had Hélène not fled from the room.\n\nA week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates in\r\n      Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left for\r\n      Petersburg alone."

    "text": "Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and the\r\n      loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the letters\r\n      sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had not been\r\n      found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of all for his\r\n      relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having\r\n      been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he\r\n      might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among strangers and unable\r\n      to send news of himself. The gazettes from which the old prince first\r\n      heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and\r\n      vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat\r\n      and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood\r\n      from this official report that our army had been defeated. A week after\r\n      the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kutúzov\r\n      informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son.\n“Your son,” wrote Kutúzov, “fell before my eyes, a standard in his hand\r\n      and at the head of a regiment—he fell as a hero, worthy of his\r\n      father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the whole\r\n      army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort myself\r\n      and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would have\r\n      been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle, a list of\r\n      whom has been sent me under flag of truce.”\nAfter receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his\r\n      study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he was\r\n      silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though he\r\n      looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.\nWhen Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his\r\n      lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.\n“Ah, Princess Mary!” he said suddenly in an unnatural voice, throwing down\r\n      his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus, and\r\n      Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel, which merged\r\n      in her memory with what followed.)\nShe approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her. Her\r\n      eyes grew dim. By the expression of her father’s face, not sad, not\r\n      crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over her\r\n      and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst in life,\r\n      one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and incomprehensible—the\r\n      death of one she loved.\n“Father! Andrew!”—said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an\r\n      indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could\r\n      not bear her look but turned away with a sob.\n“Bad news! He’s not among the prisoners nor among the killed! Kutúzov\r\n      writes...” and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive the\r\n      princess away by that scream... “Killed!”\nThe princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but on\r\n      hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her\r\n      beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy—a supreme joy apart from\r\n      the joys and sorrows of this world—overflowed the great grief within\r\n      her. She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and\r\n      drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.\n“Father,” she said, “do not turn away from me, let us weep together.”\n“Scoundrels! Blackguards!” shrieked the old man, turning his face away\r\n      from her. “Destroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go, go and\r\n      tell Lise.”\nThe princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and wept.\r\n      She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took leave of\r\n      her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender and amused\r\n      as he was when he put on the little icon. “Did he believe? Had he repented\r\n      of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms of eternal peace\r\n      and blessedness?” she thought.\n“Father, tell me how it happened,” she asked through her tears.\n“Go! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and Russia’s\r\n      glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell Lise. I will\r\n      follow.”\nWhen Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat\r\n      working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm\r\n      peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see\r\n      Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something\r\n      joyful and mysterious taking place within her.\n“Mary,” she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back,\r\n      “give me your hand.” She took her sister-in-law’s hand and held it below\r\n      her waist.\nHer eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained lifted\r\n      in childlike happiness.\nPrincess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her\r\n      sister-in-law’s dress.\n“There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know, Mary, I\r\n      am going to love him very much,” said Lise, looking with bright and happy\r\n      eyes at her sister-in-law.\nPrincess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.\n“What is the matter, Mary?”\n“Nothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,” she said, wiping away\r\n      her tears on her sister-in-law’s knee.\nSeveral times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to\r\n      prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as was\r\n      the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not\r\n      understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if\r\n      in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was\r\n      always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign\r\n      expression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at\r\n      Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of\r\n      attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women, and\r\n      suddenly began to cry.\n“Has anything come from Andrew?” she asked.\n“No, you know it’s too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I feel\r\n      afraid.”\n“So there’s nothing?”\n“Nothing,” answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant eyes at\r\n      her sister-in-law.\nShe had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the\r\n      terrible news from her till after her confinement, which was expected\r\n      within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid\r\n      their grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope:\r\n      he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he sent\r\n      an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a\r\n      monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his\r\n      memory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed. He tried not\r\n      to change his former way of life, but his strength failed him. He walked\r\n      less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary\r\n      hoped. She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news\r\n      of his return."

    "text": "“Dearest,” said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of the\r\n      nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit, but as\r\n      sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and even\r\n      every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so now the\r\n      smile of the little princess—influenced by the general mood though\r\n      without knowing its cause—was such as to remind one still more of\r\n      the general sorrow.\n“Dearest, I’m afraid this morning’sfruschtique*—as Fóka the cook\r\n      calls it—has disagreed with me.”\n* Frühstück: breakfast.\n“What is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. Oh, you are very\r\n      pale!” said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft, ponderous steps\r\n      up to her sister-in-law.\n“Your excellency, should not Mary Bogdánovna be sent for?” said one of the\r\n      maids who was present. (Mary Bogdánovna was a midwife from the neighboring\r\n      town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.)\n“Oh yes,” assented Princess Mary, “perhaps that’s it. I’ll go. Courage, my\r\n      angel.” She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.\n“Oh, no, no!” And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the\r\n      little princess’ face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain\r\n      showed itself.\n“No, it’s only indigestion?... Say it’s only indigestion, say so, Mary!\r\n      Say...” And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering\r\n      child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation. Princess\r\n      Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogdánovna.\n“Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!Oh!” she heard as she left the room.\nThe midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump\r\n      white hands with an air of calm importance.\n“Mary Bogdánovna, I think it’s beginning!” said Princess Mary looking at\r\n      the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.\n“Well, the Lord be thanked, Princess,” said Mary Bogdánovna, not hastening\r\n      her steps. “You young ladies should not know anything about it.”\n“But how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?” said the princess.\r\n      (In accordance with Lise’s and Prince Andrew’s wishes they had sent in\r\n      good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any moment.)\n“No matter, Princess, don’t be alarmed,” said Mary Bogdánovna. “We’ll\r\n      manage very well without a doctor.”\nFive minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy being\r\n      carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the large\r\n      leather sofa from Prince Andrew’s study into the bedroom. On their faces\r\n      was a quiet and solemn look.\nPrincess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house,\r\n      now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching what was\r\n      going on in the passage. Some women passing with quiet steps in and out of\r\n      the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away. She did not venture\r\n      to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting down in her\r\n      easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before the icon\r\n      stand. To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers did not\r\n      calm her excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse,\r\n      Praskóvya Sávishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince\r\n      had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl round her head.\n“I’ve come to sit with you a bit, Másha,” said the nurse, “and here I’ve\r\n      brought the prince’s wedding candles to light before his saint, my angel,”\r\n       she said with a sigh.\n“Oh, nurse, I’m so glad!”\n“God is merciful, birdie.”\nThe nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door\r\n      with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began reading. Only when\r\n      footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another, the princess\r\n      anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging. Everyone in the house was\r\n      dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced as she sat in\r\n      her room. But owing to the superstition that the fewer the people who know\r\n      of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not\r\n      to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and\r\n      respectful good manners habitual in the prince’s household, a common\r\n      anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a consciousness that something\r\n      great and mysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself\r\n      felt.\nThere was no laughter in the maids’ large hall. In the men servants’ hall\r\n      all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs’ quarters\r\n      torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old prince,\r\n      stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent Tíkhon to ask\r\n      Mary Bogdánovna what news.—“Say only that ‘the prince told me to\r\n      ask,’ and come and tell me her answer.”\n“Inform the prince that labor has begun,” said Mary Bogdánovna, giving the\r\n      messenger a significant look.\nTíkhon went and told the prince.\n“Very good!” said the prince closing the door behind him, and Tíkhon did\r\n      not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.\nAfter a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing the\r\n      prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed face,\r\n      shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the shoulder\r\n      and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had\r\n      entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course.\r\n      Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of\r\n      heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased. No\r\n      one slept.\nIt was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its\r\n      sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay\r\n      of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from\r\n      Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns\r\n      were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its\r\n      hollows and snow-covered pools of water.\nPrincess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her\r\n      luminous eyes fixed on her nurse’s wrinkled face (every line of which she\r\n      knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the\r\n      kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.\nNurse Sávishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely\r\n      hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of\r\n      times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary in\r\n      Kishenëv with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a midwife.\n“God is merciful, doctors are never needed,” she said.\nSuddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the window,\r\n      from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the prince, one\r\n      window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks returned), and,\r\n      forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask curtain flapping and\r\n      blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft. Princess Mary shuddered;\r\n      her nurse, putting down the stocking she was knitting, went to the window\r\n      and leaning out tried to catch the open casement. The cold wind flapped\r\n      the ends of her kerchief and her loose locks of gray hair.\n“Princess, my dear, there’s someone driving up the avenue!” she said,\r\n      holding the casement and not closing it. “With lanterns. Most likely the\r\n      doctor.”\n“Oh, my God! thank God!” said Princess Mary. “I must go and meet him, he\r\n      does not know Russian.”\nPrincess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer. As\r\n      she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage with\r\n      lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On a\r\n      banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On the\r\n      landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding\r\n      another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one could\r\n      hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that seemed\r\n      familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.\n“Thank God!” said the voice. “And Father?”\n“Gone to bed,” replied the voice of Demyán the house steward, who was\r\n      downstairs.\nThen the voice said something more, Demyán replied, and the steps in the\r\n      felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.\n“It’s Andrew!” thought Princess Mary. “No it can’t be, that would be too\r\n      extraordinary,” and at the very moment she thought this, the face and\r\n      figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered\r\n      with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the\r\n      candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and strangely softened\r\n      but agitated expression on his face. He came up the stairs and embraced\r\n      his sister.\n“You did not get my letter?” he asked, and not waiting for a reply—which\r\n      he would not have received, for the princess was unable to speak—he\r\n      turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had\r\n      entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post station), and\r\n      again embraced his sister.\n“What a strange fate, Másha darling!” And having taken off his cloak and\r\n      felt boots, he went to the little princess’ apartment."

    "text": "The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her head\r\n      (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round her\r\n      inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip\r\n      was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered and paused\r\n      facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying. Her glittering\r\n      eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested on him without\r\n      changing their expression. “I love you all and have done no harm to\r\n      anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!” her look seemed to say. She saw\r\n      her husband, but did not realize the significance of his appearance before\r\n      her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and kissed her forehead.\n“My darling!” he said—a word he had never used to her before. “God\r\n      is merciful....”\nShe looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.\n“I expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!” said her\r\n      eyes. She was not surprised at his having come; she did not realize that\r\n      he had come. His coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or with\r\n      their relief. The pangs began again and Mary Bogdánovna advised Prince\r\n      Andrew to leave the room.\nThe doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary,\r\n      again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke off\r\n      at every moment. They waited and listened.\n“Go, dear,” said Princess Mary.\nPrince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next to\r\n      hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became\r\n      confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands\r\n      and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came\r\n      through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to\r\n      open it. Someone was holding it shut.\n“You can’t come in! You can’t!” said a terrified voice from within.\nHe began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds\r\n      went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek—it could not be hers, she\r\n      could not scream like that—came from the bedroom. Prince Andrew ran\r\n      to the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.\n“What have they taken a baby in there for?” thought Prince Andrew in the\r\n      first second. “A baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or is the\r\n      baby born?”\nThen suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail; tears\r\n      choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill he began to cry,\r\n      sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his shirt sleeves\r\n      tucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling jaw, came out of the\r\n      room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor gave him a bewildered\r\n      look and passed by without a word. A woman rushed out and seeing Prince\r\n      Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold. He went into his wife’s room.\r\n      She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen her in five minutes\r\n      before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks, the same\r\n      expression was on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered\r\n      with tiny black hair.\n“I love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have you done\r\n      to me?”—said her charming, pathetic, dead face.\nIn a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed\r\n      in Mary Bogdánovna’s trembling white hands.\n\nTwo hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his father’s\r\n      room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to the\r\n      door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise round\r\n      his son’s neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.\n\nThree days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went up\r\n      the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss. And\r\n      there in the coffin was the same face, though with closed eyes. “Ah, what\r\n      have you done to me?” it still seemed to say, and Prince Andrew felt that\r\n      something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin he could\r\n      neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The old man too came up and\r\n      kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one on the other on\r\n      her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed to say: “Ah, what have you\r\n      done to me, and why?” And at the sight the old man turned angrily away.\n\nAnother five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas Andréevich\r\n      was baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin, while\r\n      the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy’s little red and wrinkled\r\n      soles and palms.\nHis grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping\r\n      him, carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over to\r\n      the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew sat in another room, faint\r\n      with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font, and awaited the\r\n      termination of the ceremony. He looked up joyfully at the baby when the\r\n      nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that the wax\r\n      with the baby’s hair had not sunk in the font but had floated."

    "text": "Rostóv’s share in Dólokhov’s duel with Bezúkhov was hushed up by the\r\n      efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks as he\r\n      expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of Moscow.\r\n      As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the family,\r\n      but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties. Dólokhov recovered,\r\n      and Rostóv became very friendly with him during his convalescence.\r\n      Dólokhov lay ill at his mother’s who loved him passionately and tenderly,\r\n      and old Mary Ivánovna, who had grown fond of Rostóv for his friendship to\r\n      her Fédya, often talked to him about her son.\n“Yes, Count,” she would say, “he is too noble and pure-souled for our\r\n      present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like a reproach\r\n      to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it honorable, of\r\n      Bezúkhov? And Fédya, with his noble spirit, loved him and even now never\r\n      says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg when they played some\r\n      tricks on a policeman, didn’t they do it together? And there! Bezúkhov got\r\n      off scotfree, while Fédya had to bear the whole burden on his shoulders.\r\n      Fancy what he had to go through! It’s true he has been reinstated, but how\r\n      could they fail to do that? I think there were not many such gallant sons\r\n      of the fatherland out there as he. And now—this duel! Have these\r\n      people no feeling, or honor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge\r\n      him and shoot so straight! It’s well God had mercy on us. And what was it\r\n      for? Who doesn’t have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I\r\n      see things he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for\r\n      months. And then to call him out, reckoning on Fédya not fighting because\r\n      he owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand\r\n      Fédya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few\r\n      people do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!”\nDólokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rostóv in a way no one\r\n      would have expected of him.\n“I know people consider me a bad man!” he said. “Let them! I don’t care a\r\n      straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love, I love so that I\r\n      would give my life for them, and the others I’d throttle if they stood in\r\n      my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother, and two or three friends—you\r\n      among them—and as for the rest I only care about them in so far as\r\n      they are harmful or useful. And most of them are harmful, especially the\r\n      women. Yes, dear boy,” he continued, “I have met loving, noble,\r\n      high-minded men, but I have not yet met any women—countesses or\r\n      cooks—who were not venal. I have not yet met that divine purity and\r\n      devotion I look for in women. If I found such a one I’d give my life for\r\n      her! But those!...” and he made a gesture of contempt. “And believe me, if\r\n      I still value my life it is only because I still hope to meet such a\r\n      divine creature, who will regenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you\r\n      don’t understand it.”\n“Oh, yes, I quite understand,” answered Rostóv, who was under his new\r\n      friend’s influence.\nIn the autumn the Rostóvs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter Denísov\r\n      also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the winter of 1806,\r\n      which Nicholas Rostóv spent in Moscow, was one of the happiest, merriest\r\n      times for him and the whole family. Nicholas brought many young men to his\r\n      parents’ house. Véra was a handsome girl of twenty; Sónya a girl of\r\n      sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower; Natásha, half grown up\r\n      and half child, was now childishly amusing, now girlishly enchanting.\nAt that time in the Rostóvs’ house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere\r\n      characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming\r\n      girls. Every young man who came to the house—seeing those\r\n      impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own\r\n      happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful\r\n      bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of\r\n      young girls ready for anything and full of hope—experienced the same\r\n      feeling; sharing with the young folk of the Rostóvs’ household a readiness\r\n      to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.\nAmong the young men introduced by Rostóv one of the first was Dólokhov,\r\n      whom everyone in the house liked except Natásha. She almost quarreled with\r\n      her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad man, and that in the\r\n      duel with Bezúkhov, Pierre was right and Dólokhov wrong, and further that\r\n      he was disagreeable and unnatural.\n“There’s nothing for me to understand,” she cried out with resolute\r\n      self-will, “he is wicked and heartless. There now, I like your Denísov\r\n      though he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so you see I do\r\n      understand. I don’t know how to put it... with this one everything is\r\n      calculated, and I don’t like that. But Denísov...”\n“Oh, Denísov is quite different,” replied Nicholas, implying that even\r\n      Denísov was nothing compared to Dólokhov—“you must understand what a\r\n      soul there is in Dólokhov, you should see him with his mother. What a\r\n      heart!”\n“Well, I don’t know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And do\r\n      you know he has fallen in love with Sónya?”\n“What nonsense...”\n“I’m certain of it; you’ll see.”\nNatásha’s prediction proved true. Dólokhov, who did not usually care for\r\n      the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the question\r\n      for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon settled. He\r\n      came because of Sónya. And Sónya, though she would never have dared to say\r\n      so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time Dólokhov appeared.\nDólokhov often dined at the Rostóvs’, never missed a performance at which\r\n      they were present, and went to Iogel’s balls for young people which the\r\n      Rostóvs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to Sónya and looked at\r\n      her in such a way that not only could she not bear his glances without\r\n      coloring, but even the old countess and Natásha blushed when they saw his\r\n      looks.\nIt was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible\r\n      influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.\nRostóv noticed something new in Dólokhov’s relations with Sónya, but he\r\n      did not explain to himself what these new relations were. “They’re always\r\n      in love with someone,” he thought of Sónya and Natásha. But he was not as\r\n      much at ease with Sónya and Dólokhov as before and was less frequently at\r\n      home.\nIn the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with\r\n      Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders were given\r\n      to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the regular army, and\r\n      besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. Everywhere\r\n      Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war was\r\n      talked of. For the Rostóv family the whole interest of these preparations\r\n      for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of remaining in\r\n      Moscow, and only awaited the termination of Denísov’s furlough after\r\n      Christmas to return with him to their regiment. His approaching departure\r\n      did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather gave zest to his\r\n      pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away from home, at\r\n      dinners, parties, and balls."

    "text": "On the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing he had\r\n      rarely done of late. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and Denísov\r\n      were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people\r\n      were present, including Dólokhov and Denísov.\nNever had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous\r\n      atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostóvs’ house as at this\r\n      holiday time. “Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That is\r\n      the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing we\r\n      are interested in here,” said the spirit of the place.\nNicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without visiting\r\n      all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited, returned\r\n      home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and felt the\r\n      tension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a curious\r\n      embarrassment among some of those present. Sónya, Dólokhov, and the old\r\n      countess were especially disturbed, and to a lesser degree Natásha.\r\n      Nicholas understood that something must have happened between Sónya and\r\n      Dólokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitiveness natural to him\r\n      was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On that same evening\r\n      there was to be one of the balls that Iogel (the dancing master) gave for\r\n      his pupils during the holidays.\n“Nicholas, will you come to Iogel’s? Please do!” said Natásha. “He asked\r\n      you, and Vasíli Dmítrich * is also going.”\n* Denísov.\n“Where would I not go at the countess’ command!” said Denísov, who at the\r\n      Rostóvs’ had jocularly assumed the role of Natásha’s knight. “I’m even\r\n      weady to dance thepas de châle.”\n“If I have time,” answered Nicholas. “But I promised the Arkhárovs; they\r\n      have a party.”\n“And you?” he asked Dólokhov, but as soon as he had asked the question he\r\n      noticed that it should not have been put.\n“Perhaps,” coldly and angrily replied Dólokhov, glancing at Sónya, and,\r\n      scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre at the\r\n      club dinner.\n“There is something up,” thought Nicholas, and he was further confirmed in\r\n      this conclusion by the fact that Dólokhov left immediately after dinner.\r\n      He called Natásha and asked her what was the matter.\n“And I was looking for you,” said Natásha running out to him. “I told you,\r\n      but you would not believe it,” she said triumphantly. “He has proposed to\r\n      Sónya!”\nLittle as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sónya of late, something\r\n      seemed to give way within him at this news. Dólokhov was a suitable and in\r\n      some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From the\r\n      point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the\r\n      question for her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholas’ first feeling on\r\n      hearing the news was one of anger with Sónya.... He tried to say, “That’s\r\n      capital; of course she’ll forget her childish promises and accept the\r\n      offer,” but before he had time to say it Natásha began again.\n“And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!” adding, after a pause, “she\r\n      told him she loved another.”\n“Yes, my Sónya could not have done otherwise!” thought Nicholas.\n“Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won’t change once\r\n      she has said...”\n“And Mamma pressed her!” said Nicholas reproachfully.\n“Yes,” said Natásha. “Do you know, Nicholas—don’t be angry—but\r\n      I know you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but I know for\r\n      certain that you won’t marry her.”\n“Now you don’t know that at all!” said Nicholas. “But I must talk to her.\r\n      What a darling Sónya is!” he added with a smile.\n“Ah, she is indeed a darling! I’ll send her to you.”\nAnd Natásha kissed her brother and ran away.\nA minute later Sónya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared look.\r\n      Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the first time since\r\n      his return that they had talked alone and about their love.\n“Sophie,” he began, timidly at first and then more and more boldly, “if\r\n      you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous match\r\n      but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend...”\nSónya interrupted him.\n“I have already refused,” she said hurriedly.\n“If you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I...”\nSónya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.\n“Nicholas, don’t tell me that!” she said.\n“No, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say it.\r\n      If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I love\r\n      you, and I think I love you more than anyone else....”\n“That is enough for me,” said Sónya, blushing.\n“No, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love\r\n      again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship, confidence,\r\n      and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does not wish it. In a\r\n      word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider Dólokhov’s offer,” he\r\n      said, articulating his friend’s name with difficulty.\n“Don’t say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and always\r\n      shall, and I want nothing more.”\n“You are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of misleading\r\n      you.”\nAnd Nicholas again kissed her hand."

    "text": "Iogel’s were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers as\r\n      they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps, and\r\n      so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were\r\n      ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and women who came to\r\n      these balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable.\r\n      That year two marriages had come of these balls. The two pretty young\r\n      Princesses Gorchakóv met suitors there and were married and so further\r\n      increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished them from others\r\n      was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good-natured\r\n      Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of\r\n      his art, as he collected the tickets from all his visitors. There was the\r\n      fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as\r\n      girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the\r\n      first time. With scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to be,\r\n      pretty—so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes.\r\n      Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom Natásha, who was exceptionally\r\n      graceful, was first, even danced thepas de châle, but at this last ball\r\n      only theécossaise, theanglaise, and the mazurka, which was just coming\r\n      into fashion, were danced. Iogel had taken a ballroom in Bezúkhov’s house,\r\n      and the ball, as everyone said, was a great success. There were many\r\n      pretty girls and the Rostóv girls were among the prettiest. They were both\r\n      particularly happy and gay. That evening, proud of Dólokhov’s proposal,\r\n      her refusal, and her explanation with Nicholas, Sónya twirled about before\r\n      she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she\r\n      was transparently radiant with impulsive joy.\nNatásha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real ball\r\n      was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with pink\r\n      ribbons.\nNatásha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She was not\r\n      in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever person she\r\n      happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.\n“Oh, how delightful it is!” she kept saying, running up to Sónya.\nNicholas and Denísov were walking up and down, looking with kindly\r\n      patronage at the dancers.\n“How sweet she is—she will be a weal beauty!” said Denísov.\n“Who?”\n“Countess Natásha,” answered Denísov.\n“And how she dances! What gwace!” he said again after a pause.\n“Who are you talking about?”\n“About your sister,” ejaculated Denísov testily.\nRostóv smiled.\n“My dear count, you were one of my best pupils—you must dance,”\r\n      said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. “Look how many charming young\r\n      ladies—” He turned with the same request to Denísov who was also a\r\n      former pupil of his.\n“No, my dear fellow, I’ll be a wallflower,” said Denísov. “Don’t you\r\n      wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?”\n“Oh no!” said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. “You were only\r\n      inattentive, but you had talent—oh yes, you had talent!”\nThe band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not\r\n      refuse Iogel and asked Sónya to dance. Denísov sat down by the old\r\n      ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told\r\n      them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young\r\n      people dancing, Iogel with Natásha, his pride and his best pupil, were\r\n      the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little feet\r\n      in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with Natásha, who, though\r\n      shy, went on carefully executing her steps. Denísov did not take\r\n      his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly\r\n      indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not\r\n      because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rostóv\r\n      who was passing:\n“This is not at all the thing,” he said. “What sort of Polish mazuwka is\r\n      this? But she does dance splendidly.”\nKnowing that Denísov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly way\r\n      in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to Natásha:\n“Go and choose Denísov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!” he said.\nWhen it came to Natásha’s turn to choose a partner, she rose and, tripping\r\n      rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran timidly to the\r\n      corner where Denísov sat. She saw that everybody was looking at her and\r\n      waiting. Nicholas saw that Denísov was refusing though he smiled\r\n      delightedly. He ran up to them.\n“Please, Vasíli Dmítrich,” Natásha was saying, “do come!”\n“Oh no, let me off, Countess,” Denísov replied.\n“Now then, Váska,” said Nicholas.\n“They coax me as if I were Váska the cat!” said Denísov jokingly.\n“I’ll sing for you a whole evening,” said Natásha.\n“Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!” said Denísov, and he\r\n      unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his\r\n      partner’s hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot, waiting\r\n      for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was Denísov’s short\r\n      stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to\r\n      be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with\r\n      a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with one foot, bounded from\r\n      the floor like a ball, and flew round the room taking his partner with\r\n      him. He glided silently on one foot half across the room, and seeming not\r\n      to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them, when suddenly, clinking\r\n      his spurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped short on his heels, stood\r\n      so a second, stamped on the spot clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly\r\n      round, and, striking his left heel against his right, flew round again in\r\n      a circle. Natásha guessed what he meant to do, and abandoning herself to\r\n      him followed his lead hardly knowing how. First he spun her round, holding\r\n      her now with his left, now with his right hand, then falling on one knee\r\n      he twirled her round him, and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously\r\n      forward that it seemed as if he would rush through the whole suite of\r\n      rooms without drawing breath, and then he suddenly stopped and performed\r\n      some new and unexpected steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner\r\n      round in front of her chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and\r\n      bowed to her, Natásha did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes\r\n      on him in amazement, smiling as if she did not recognize him.\n“What does this mean?” she brought out.\nAlthough Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone\r\n      was delighted with Denísov’s skill, he was asked again and again as a\r\n      partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the good\r\n      old days. Denísov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his\r\n      handkerchief, sat down by Natásha and did not leave her for the rest of\r\n      the evening."

    "text": "For two days after that Rostóv did not see Dólokhov at his own or at\r\n      Dólokhov’s home: on the third day he received a note from him:\nAs I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of, and\r\n      am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper tonight to\r\n      my friends—come to the English Hotel.\nAbout ten o’clock Rostóv went to the English Hotel straight from the\r\n      theater, where he had been with his family and Denísov. He was at once\r\n      shown to the best room, which Dólokhov had taken for that evening. Some\r\n      twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dólokhov sat between two\r\n      candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he was\r\n      keeping the bank. Rostóv had not seen him since his proposal and Sónya’s\r\n      refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet.\nDólokhov’s clear, cold glance met Rostóv as soon as he entered the door,\r\n      as though he had long expected him.\n“It’s a long time since we met,” he said. “Thanks for coming. I’ll just\r\n      finish dealing, and then Ilyúshka will come with his chorus.”\n“I called once or twice at your house,” said Rostóv, reddening.\nDólokhov made no reply.\n“You may punt,” he said.\nRostóv recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had with\r\n      Dólokhov. “None but fools trust to luck in play,” Dólokhov had then said.\n“Or are you afraid to play with me?” Dólokhov now asked as if guessing\r\n      Rostóv’s thought.\nBeneath his smile Rostóv saw in him the mood he had shown at the club\r\n      dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt a\r\n      need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.\nRostóv felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with\r\n      which to reply to Dólokhov’s words. But before he had thought of anything,\r\n      Dólokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and deliberately so\r\n      that everyone could hear:\n“Do you remember we had a talk about cards... ‘He’s a fool who trusts to\r\n      luck, one should make certain,’ and I want to try.”\n“To try his luck or the certainty?” Rostóv asked himself.\n“Well, you’d better not play,” Dólokhov added, and springing a new pack of\r\n      cards said: “Bank, gentlemen!”\nMoving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rostóv sat down by his side\r\n      and at first did not play. Dólokhov kept glancing at him.\n“Why don’t you play?” he asked.\nAnd strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a card,\r\n      putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.\n“I have no money with me,” he said.\n“I’ll trust you.”\nRostóv staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again\r\n      lost. Dólokhov “killed,” that is, beat, ten cards of Rostóv’s running.\n“Gentlemen,” said Dólokhov after he had dealt for some time. “Please place\r\n      your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning.”\nOne of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.\n“Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I ask\r\n      you to put the money on your cards,” replied Dólokhov. “Don’t stint\r\n      yourself, we’ll settle afterwards,” he added, turning to Rostóv.\nThe game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.\nAll Rostóv’s cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up\r\n      against him. He wrote “800 rubles” on a card, but while the waiter filled\r\n      his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake of twenty\r\n      rubles.\n“Leave it,” said Dólokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking at\r\n      Rostóv, “you’ll win it back all the sooner. I lose to the others but win\r\n      from you. Or are you afraid of me?” he asked again.\nRostóv submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven of\r\n      hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He well\r\n      remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts, on\r\n      which with a broken bit of chalk he had written “800 rubles” in clear\r\n      upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed\r\n      him, smiled at Dólokhov’s words, and with a sinking heart, waiting for a\r\n      seven to turn up, gazed at Dólokhov’s hands which held the pack. Much\r\n      depended on Rostóv’s winning or losing on that seven of hearts. On the\r\n      previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles, and\r\n      though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas\r\n      that this was all he could let him have till May, and asked him to be more\r\n      economical this time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than\r\n      enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything\r\n      more till the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that\r\n      money, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of\r\n      sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word. With\r\n      a sinking heart he watched Dólokhov’s hands and thought, “Now then, make\r\n      haste and let me have this card and I’ll take my cap and drive home to\r\n      supper with Denísov, Natásha, and Sónya, and will certainly never touch a\r\n      card again.” At that moment his home life, jokes with Pétya, talks with\r\n      Sónya, duets with Natásha, piquet with his father, and even his\r\n      comfortable bed in the house on the Povarskáya rose before him with such\r\n      vividness, clearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost\r\n      and unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid\r\n      chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left,\r\n      might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly\r\n      illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery.\r\n      That could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of\r\n      Dólokhov’s hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible\r\n      from under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took up a glass and a\r\n      pipe that were handed him.\n“So you are not afraid to play with me?” repeated Dólokhov, and as if\r\n      about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his\r\n      chair, and began deliberately with a smile:\n“Yes, gentlemen, I’ve been told there’s a rumor going about Moscow that\r\n      I’m a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.”\n“Come now, deal!” exclaimed Rostóv.\n“Oh, those Moscow gossips!” said Dólokhov, and he took up the cards with a\r\n      smile.\n“Aah!” Rostóv almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The seven he\r\n      needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had lost more\r\n      than he could pay.\n“Still, don’t ruin yourself!” said Dólokhov with a side glance at Rostóv\r\n      as he continued to deal."

    "text": "An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in\r\n      their own play.\nThe whole interest was concentrated on Rostóv. Instead of sixteen hundred\r\n      rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him, which he had\r\n      reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely supposed, must\r\n      have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already exceeded twenty\r\n      thousand rubles. Dólokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling\r\n      them, but followed every movement of Rostóv’s hands and occasionally ran\r\n      his eyes over the score against him. He had decided to play until that\r\n      score reached forty-three thousand. He had fixed on that number because\r\n      forty-three was the sum of his and Sónya’s joint ages. Rostóv, leaning his\r\n      head on both hands, sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures,\r\n      wet with spilled wine, and littered with cards. One tormenting impression\r\n      did not leave him: that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists\r\n      visible from under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and\r\n      hated, held him in their power.\n“Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back’s\r\n      impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or\r\n      quits... it can’t be!... And why is he doing this to me?” Rostóv pondered.\r\n      Sometimes he staked a large sum, but Dólokhov refused to accept it and\r\n      fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at one moment\r\n      prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the\r\n      Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the\r\n      crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the cords on his\r\n      coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his\r\n      losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other players, or\r\n      peered at the now cold face of Dólokhov and tried to read what was passing\r\n      in his mind.\n“He knows of course what this loss means to me. He can’t want my ruin.\r\n      Wasn’t he my friend? Wasn’t I fond of him? But it’s not his fault. What’s\r\n      he to do if he has such luck?... And it’s not my fault either,” he thought\r\n      to himself, “I have done nothing wrong. Have I killed anyone, or insulted\r\n      or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortune? And when did it\r\n      begin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with the thought of\r\n      winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma’s name day and then\r\n      going home. I was so happy, so free, so lighthearted! And I did not\r\n      realize how happy I was! When did that end and when did this new, terrible\r\n      state of things begin? What marked the change? I sat all the time in this\r\n      same place at this table, chose and placed cards, and watched those\r\n      broad-boned agile hands in the same way. When did it happen and what has\r\n      happened? I am well and strong and still the same and in the same place.\r\n      No, it can’t be! Surely it will all end in nothing!”\nHe was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot.\r\n      His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless\r\n      efforts to seem calm.\nThe score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand.\r\n      Rostóv had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant\r\n      to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when Dólokhov,\r\n      slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding up\r\n      the total of Rostóv’s debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in\r\n      his clear, bold hand.\n“Supper, it’s time for supper! And here are the gypsies!”\nSome swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside and\r\n      saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it was\r\n      all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:\n“Well, won’t you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,” as if it were\r\n      the fun of the game which interested him most.\n“It’s all up! I’m lost!” thought he. “Now a bullet through my brain—that’s\r\n      all that’s left me!” And at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:\n“Come now, just this one more little card!”\n“All right!” said Dólokhov, having finished the addition. “All right!\r\n      Twenty-one rubles,” he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by which\r\n      the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up a\r\n      pack he prepared to deal. Rostóv submissively unbent the corner of his\r\n      card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote\r\n      twenty-one.\n“It’s all the same to me,” he said. “I only want to see whether you will\r\n      let me win this ten, or beat it.”\nDólokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rostóv detested at that moment\r\n      those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists, which held\r\n      him in their power.... The ten fell to him.\n“You owe forty-three thousand, Count,” said Dólokhov, and stretching\r\n      himself he rose from the table. “One does get tired sitting so long,” he\r\n      added.\n“Yes, I’m tired too,” said Rostóv.\nDólokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to\r\n      jest.\n“When am I to receive the money, Count?”\nRostóv, flushing, drew Dólokhov into the next room.\n“I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?” he said.\n“I say, Rostóv,” said Dólokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas\r\n      straight in the eyes, “you know the saying, ‘Lucky in love, unlucky at\r\n      cards.’ Your cousin is in love with you, I know.”\n“Oh, it’s terrible to feel oneself so in this man’s power,” thought\r\n      Rostóv. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by\r\n      the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all,\r\n      and felt that Dólokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and\r\n      sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse.\n“Your cousin...” Dólokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted him.\n“My cousin has nothing to do with this and it’s not necessary to mention\r\n      her!” he exclaimed fiercely.\n“Then when am I to have it?”\n“Tomorrow,” replied Rostóv and left the room."

    "text": "To say “tomorrow” and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult, but to\r\n      go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father, confess and\r\n      ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor, was\r\n      terrible.\nAt home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after returning\r\n      from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord. As\r\n      soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of\r\n      love which pervaded the Rostóv household that winter and, now after\r\n      Dólokhov’s proposal and Iogel’s ball, seemed to have grown thicker round\r\n      Sónya and Natásha as the air does before a thunderstorm. Sónya and\r\n      Natásha, in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater, looking\r\n      pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord, happy and\r\n      smiling. Véra was playing chess with Shinshín in the drawing room. The old\r\n      countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son, sat playing\r\n      patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denísov, with\r\n      sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord striking chords\r\n      with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he\r\n      sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some verses called\r\n      “Enchantress,” which he had composed, and to which he was trying to fit\r\n      music:\nEnchantress, say, to my forsaken lyreWhat magic power is this recalls me still?What spark has set my inmost soul on fire,What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?\nHe was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling black-agate\r\n      eyes at the frightened and happy Natásha.\n“Splendid! Excellent!” exclaimed Natásha. “Another verse,” she said,\r\n      without noticing Nicholas.\n“Everything’s still the same with them,” thought Nicholas, glancing into\r\n      the drawing room, where he saw Véra and his mother with the old lady.\n“Ah, and here’s Nicholas!” cried Natásha, running up to him.\n“Is Papa at home?” he asked.\n“I am so glad you’ve come!” said Natásha, without answering him. “We are\r\n      enjoying ourselves! Vasíli Dmítrich is staying a day longer for my sake!\r\n      Did you know?”\n“No, Papa is not back yet,” said Sónya.\n“Nicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!” called the old countess from\r\n      the drawing room.\nNicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her\r\n      table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing room,\r\n      they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade Natásha\r\n      to sing.\n“All wight! All wight!” shouted Denísov. “It’s no good making excuses now!\r\n      It’s your turn to sing the ba’cawolla—I entweat you!”\nThe countess glanced at her silent son.\n“What is the matter?” she asked.\n“Oh, nothing,” said he, as if weary of being continually asked the same\r\n      question. “Will Papa be back soon?”\n“I expect so.”\n“Everything’s the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where am I\r\n      to go?” thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing room where the\r\n      clavichord stood.\nSónya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to Denísov’s\r\n      favorite barcarolle. Natásha was preparing to sing. Denísov was looking at\r\n      her with enraptured eyes.\nNicholas began pacing up and down the room.\n“Why do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There’s nothing to\r\n      be happy about!” thought he.\nSónya struck the first chord of the prelude.\n“My God, I’m a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain is the\r\n      only thing left me—not singing!” his thoughts ran on. “Go away? But\r\n      where to? It’s one—let them sing!”\nHe continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Denísov and the girls\r\n      and avoiding their eyes.\n“Nikólenka, what is the matter?” Sónya’s eyes fixed on him seemed to ask.\r\n      She noticed at once that something had happened to him.\nNicholas turned away from her. Natásha too, with her quick instinct, had\r\n      instantly noticed her brother’s condition. But, though she noticed it, she\r\n      was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from sorrow,\r\n      sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself as young\r\n      people often do. “No, I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy\r\n      with anyone’s sorrow,” she felt, and she said to herself: “No, I must be\r\n      mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as I am.”\n“Now, Sónya!” she said, going to the very middle of the room, where she\r\n      considered the resonance was best.\nHaving lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet\r\n      dancers do, Natásha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes,\r\n      stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.\n“Yes, that’s me!” she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with which\r\n      Denísov followed her.\n“And what is she so pleased about?” thought Nicholas, looking at his\r\n      sister. “Why isn’t she dull and ashamed?”\nNatásha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose, her eyes\r\n      became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her surroundings, and\r\n      from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce at the same\r\n      intervals and hold for the same time, but which leave you cold a thousand\r\n      times and the thousand and first time thrill you and make you weep.\nNatásha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,\r\n      mainly because Denísov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang as\r\n      a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish,\r\n      painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing\r\n      well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: “It is not trained, but\r\n      it is a beautiful voice that must be trained.” Only they generally said\r\n      this some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained voice,\r\n      with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was sounding, even\r\n      the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in it and wished to hear\r\n      it again. In her voice there was a virginal freshness, an unconsciousness\r\n      of her own powers, and an as yet untrained velvety softness, which so\r\n      mingled with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in\r\n      that voice could be altered without spoiling it.\n“What is this?” thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely opened\r\n      eyes. “What has happened to her? How she is singing today!” And suddenly\r\n      the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note, the\r\n      next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into three beats:“Oh\r\n      mio crudele affetto.”... One, two, three... one, two, three... One...“Oh\r\n      mio crudele affetto.”... One, two, three... One. “Oh, this senseless life\r\n      of ours!” thought Nicholas. “All this misery, and money, and Dólokhov, and\r\n      anger, and honor—it’s all nonsense... but this is real.... Now then,\r\n      Natásha, now then, dearest! Now then, darling! How will she take thatsi?She’s taken it! Thank God!” And without noticing that he was singing, to\r\n      strengthen thesihe sung a second, a third below the high note. “Ah,\r\n      God! How fine! Did I really take it? How fortunate!” he thought.\nOh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest\r\n      in Rostóv’s soul! And this something was apart from everything else in the\r\n      world and above everything in the world. “What were losses, and Dólokhov,\r\n      and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob and yet be\r\n      happy....”"

    "text": "It was long since Rostóv had felt such enjoyment from music as he did that\r\n      day. But no sooner had Natásha finished her barcarolle than reality again\r\n      presented itself. He got up without saying a word and went downstairs to\r\n      his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count came in from his\r\n      club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him drive up, went to meet\r\n      him.\n“Well—had a good time?” said the old count, smiling gaily and\r\n      proudly at his son.\nNicholas tried to say “Yes,” but could not: and he nearly burst into sobs.\r\n      The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son’s condition.\n“Ah, it can’t be avoided!” thought Nicholas, for the first and last time.\r\n      And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel ashamed of\r\n      himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him have the\r\n      carriage to drive to town:\n“Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I\r\n      need some money.”\n“Dear me!” said his father, who was in a specially good humor. “I told you\r\n      it would not be enough. How much?”\n“Very much,” said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless smile, for\r\n      which he was long unable to forgive himself, “I have lost a little, I mean\r\n      a good deal, a great deal—forty three thousand.”\n“What! To whom?... Nonsense!” cried the count, suddenly reddening with an\r\n      apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.\n“I promised to pay tomorrow,” said Nicholas.\n“Well!...” said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking\r\n      helplessly on the sofa.\n“It can’t be helped! It happens to everyone!” said the son,\r\n      with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a\r\n      worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He longed\r\n      to kiss his father’s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said,\r\n      in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone!\nThe old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son’s words and began\r\n      bustlingly searching for something.\n“Yes, yes,” he muttered, “it will be difficult, I fear, difficult to\r\n      raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?”\nAnd with a furtive glance at his son’s face, the count went out of the\r\n      room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all\r\n      expected this.\n“Papa! Pa-pa!” he called after him, sobbing, “forgive me!” And seizing his\r\n      father’s hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears.\nWhile father and son were having their explanation, the mother and\r\n      daughter were having one not less important. Natásha came running to her\r\n      mother, quite excited.\n“Mamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...”\n“Made what?”\n“Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!” she exclaimed.\nThe countess did not believe her ears. Denísov had proposed. To whom? To\r\n      this chit of a girl, Natásha, who not so long ago was playing with dolls\r\n      and who was still having lessons.\n“Don’t, Natásha! What nonsense!” she said, hoping it was a joke.\n“Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,” said Natásha indignantly.\r\n      “I come to ask you what to do, and you call it ‘nonsense!’”\nThe countess shrugged her shoulders.\n“If it is true that Monsieur Denísov has made you a proposal, tell him he\r\n      is a fool, that’s all!”\n“No, he’s not a fool!” replied Natásha indignantly and seriously.\n“Well then, what do you want? You’re all in love nowadays. Well, if you\r\n      are in love, marry him!” said the countess, with a laugh of annoyance.\r\n      “Good luck to you!”\n“No, Mamma, I’m not in love with him, I suppose I’m not in love with him.”\n“Well then, tell him so.”\n“Mamma, are you cross? Don’t be cross, dear! Is it my fault?”\n“No, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?” said the\r\n      countess smiling.\n“No, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. It’s all very well for\r\n      you,” said Natásha, with a responsive smile. “You should have seen how he\r\n      said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came out accidently.”\n“Well, all the same, you must refuse him.”\n“No, I mustn’t. I am so sorry for him! He’s so nice.”\n“Well then, accept his offer. It’s high time for you to be married,”\r\n       answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.\n“No, Mamma, but I’m so sorry for him. I don’t know how I’m to say it.”\n“And there’s nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself,” said\r\n      the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this little\r\n      Natásha as grown up.\n“No, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and you’ll listen at the\r\n      door,” and Natásha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall, where\r\n      Denísov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his face in\r\n      his hands.\nHe jumped up at the sound of her light step.\n“Nataly,” he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, “decide my fate. It\r\n      is in your hands.”\n“Vasíli Dmítrich, I’m so sorry for you!... No, but you are so nice... but\r\n      it won’t do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always love you.”\nDenísov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not\r\n      understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they\r\n      heard the quick rustle of the countess’ dress. She came up to them.\n“Vasíli Dmítrich, I thank you for the honor,” she said, with an\r\n      embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Denísov—“but my\r\n      daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my son’s friend, you would\r\n      have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not have\r\n      obliged me to give this refusal.”\n“Countess...” said Denísov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face. He tried\r\n      to say more, but faltered.\nNatásha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began to\r\n      sob aloud.\n“Countess, I have done w’ong,” Denísov went on in an unsteady voice, “but\r\n      believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family that I would give\r\n      my life twice over...” He looked at the countess, and seeing her severe\r\n      face said: “Well, good-by, Countess,” and kissing her hand, he left the\r\n      room with quick resolute strides, without looking at Natásha.\n\nNext day Rostóv saw Denísov off. He did not wish to stay another day in\r\n      Moscow. All Denísov’s Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment at\r\n      the gypsies’, with the result that he had no recollection of how he was\r\n      put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey.\nAfter Denísov’s departure, Rostóv spent another fortnight in Moscow,\r\n      without going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could not\r\n      at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girls’ room.\nSónya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she\r\n      wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her love\r\n      him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of her.\nHe filled the girls’ albums with verses and music, and having at last sent\r\n      Dólokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his receipt,\r\n      he left at the end of November, without taking leave of any of his\r\n      acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland."

    "text": "After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the\r\n      Torzhók post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster would\r\n      not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing, he lay\r\n      down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in\r\n      their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.\n“Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and tea?”\r\n       asked his valet.\nPierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had begun\r\n      to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same question—one\r\n      so important that he took no notice of what went on around him. Not only\r\n      was he indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg earlier or later, or\r\n      whether he secured accommodation at this station, but compared to the\r\n      thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of indifference whether he\r\n      remained there for a few hours or for the rest of his life.\nThe postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling Torzhók\r\n      embroidery came into the room offering their services. Without changing\r\n      his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable to\r\n      understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without having\r\n      solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had been engrossed by the\r\n      same thoughts ever since the day he returned from Sokólniki after the duel\r\n      and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless night. But now, in the\r\n      solitude of the journey, they seized him with special force. No matter\r\n      what he thought about, he always returned to these same questions which he\r\n      could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself. It was as if the\r\n      thread of the chief screw which held his life together were stripped, so\r\n      that the screw could not get in or out, but went on turning uselessly in\r\n      the same place.\nThe postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to\r\n      wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency\r\n      have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted to\r\n      get more money from the traveler.\n“Is this good or bad?” Pierre asked himself. “It is good for me, bad for\r\n      another traveler, and for himself it’s unavoidable, because he needs money\r\n      for food; the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing for\r\n      letting a private traveler have the courier horses. But the officer\r\n      thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible. And I,”\r\n       continued Pierre, “shot Dólokhov because I considered myself injured, and\r\n      Louis XVI was executed because they considered him a criminal, and a year\r\n      later they executed those who executed him—also for some reason.\r\n      What is bad? What is good? What should one love and what hate? What does\r\n      one live for? And what am I? What is life, and what is death? What power\r\n      governs all?”\nThere was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that not a\r\n      logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was: “You’ll die\r\n      and all will end. You’ll die and know all, or cease asking.” But dying was\r\n      also dreadful.\nThe Torzhók peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her wares,\r\n      especially a pair of goatskin slippers. “I have hundreds of rubles I don’t\r\n      know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered cloak looking timidly\r\n      at me,” he thought. “And what does she want the money for? As if that\r\n      money could add a hair’s breadth to happiness or peace of mind. Can\r\n      anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death?—death\r\n      which ends all and must come today or tomorrow—at any rate, in an\r\n      instant as compared with eternity.” And again he twisted the screw with\r\n      the stripped thread, and again it turned uselessly in the same place.\nHis servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by Madame\r\n      de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of\r\n      a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. “And why did she resist her seducer when she\r\n      loved him?” he thought. “God could not have put into her heart an impulse\r\n      that was against His will. My wife—as she once was—did not\r\n      struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been found out, nothing\r\n      discovered,” Pierre again said to himself. “All we can know is that we\r\n      know nothing. And that’s the height of human wisdom.”\nEverything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and\r\n      repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre\r\n      found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.\n“I make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this gentleman,”\r\n       said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another traveler, also\r\n      detained for lack of horses.\nThe newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old man,\r\n      with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish\r\n      color.\nPierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that\r\n      had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who,\r\n      with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the\r\n      aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots\r\n      on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin\r\n      coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with its\r\n      broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at Bezúkhov. The stern,\r\n      shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a\r\n      wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to\r\n      ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His\r\n      shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them Pierre\r\n      noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a death’s head.\r\n      The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as it seemed to\r\n      Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant was also a\r\n      yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache, evidently not because\r\n      he was shaven but because they had never grown. This active old servant\r\n      was unpacking the traveler’s canteen and preparing tea. He brought in a\r\n      boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the stranger opened his eyes,\r\n      moved to the table, filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the\r\n      beardless old man to whom he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of\r\n      uneasiness, and the need, even the inevitability, of entering into\r\n      conversation with this stranger.\nThe servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an\r\n      unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be\r\n      wanted.\n* To indicate he did not want more tea.\n“No. Give me the book,” said the stranger.\nThe servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work,\r\n      and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at once\r\n      the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again, leaning with\r\n      his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former position with his eyes\r\n      shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when the old man,\r\n      opening his eyes, fixed his steady and severe gaze straight on Pierre’s\r\n      face.\nPierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old\r\n      eyes attracted him irresistibly."

    "text": "“I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezúkhov, if I am not mistaken,”\r\n       said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.\nPierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.\n“I have heard of you, my dear sir,” continued the stranger, “and of your\r\n      misfortune.” He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to say—“Yes,\r\n      misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what happened to you in\r\n      Moscow was a misfortune.”—“I regret it very much, my dear sir.”\nPierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent\r\n      forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.\n“I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for\r\n      greater reasons.”\nHe paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way of\r\n      inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant to\r\n      enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him\r\n      involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.\n“You are unhappy, my dear sir,” the stranger continued. “You are young and\r\n      I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my power.”\n“Oh, yes!” said Pierre, with a forced smile. “I am very grateful to you.\r\n      Where are you traveling from?”\nThe stranger’s face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but in\r\n      spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were\r\n      irresistibly attractive to Pierre.\n“But if for any reason you don’t feel inclined to talk to me,”\r\n      said the old man, “say so, my dear sir.” And he suddenly smiled, in\r\n      an unexpected and tenderly paternal way.\n“Oh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your\r\n      acquaintance,” said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger’s hands,\r\n      he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull—a Masonic sign.\n“Allow me to ask,” he said, “are you a Mason?”\n“Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,” said the stranger,\r\n      looking deeper and deeper into Pierre’s eyes. “And in their name and my\r\n      own I hold out a brotherly hand to you.”\n“I am afraid,” said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the confidence\r\n      the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit of\r\n      ridiculing the Masonic beliefs—“I am afraid I am very far from\r\n      understanding—how am I to put it?—I am afraid my way of\r\n      looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand\r\n      one another.”\n“I know your outlook,” said the Mason, “and the view of life you mention,\r\n      and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts, is the one\r\n      held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit of pride,\r\n      indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I had not known\r\n      it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a regrettable\r\n      delusion.”\n“Just as I may suppose you to be deluded,” said Pierre, with a faint\r\n      smile.\n“I should never dare to say that I know the truth,” said the Mason, whose\r\n      words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness. “No one\r\n      can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone with the\r\n      cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our forefather\r\n      Adam to our own times, is that temple reared which is to be a worthy\r\n      dwelling place of the Great God,” he added, and closed his eyes.\n“I ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in God,” said\r\n      Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it essential to speak the\r\n      whole truth.\nThe Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with millions\r\n      in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he, poor man, had\r\n      not the five rubles that would make him happy.\n“Yes, you do not know Him, my dear sir,” said the Mason. “You cannot know\r\n      Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy.”\n“Yes, yes, I am unhappy,” assented Pierre. “But what am I to do?”\n“You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You do not\r\n      know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in thee,\r\n      and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!” pronounced\r\n      the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.\nHe paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.\n“If He were not,” he said quietly, “you and I would not be speaking of\r\n      Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom hast thou\r\n      denied?” he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his\r\n      voice. “Who invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy conception\r\n      of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being? didst thou, and why\r\n      did the whole world, conceive the idea of the existence of such an\r\n      incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, and infinite in all\r\n      His attributes?...”\nHe stopped and remained silent for a long time.\nPierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.\n“He exists, but to understand Him is hard,” the Mason began again, looking\r\n      not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves of his book\r\n      with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still. “If it\r\n      were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring him to thee,\r\n      could take him by the hand and show him to thee. But how can I, an\r\n      insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity, and all His\r\n      mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may not see or\r\n      understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and\r\n      sinfulness?” He paused again. “Who art thou? Thou dreamest that thou art\r\n      wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words,” he went on, with\r\n      a somber and scornful smile. “And thou art more foolish and unreasonable\r\n      than a little child, who, playing with the parts of a skillfully made\r\n      watch, dares to say that, as he does not understand its use, he does not\r\n      believe in the master who made it. To know Him is hard.... For ages, from\r\n      our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to attain that knowledge and\r\n      are still infinitely far from our aim; but in our lack of understanding we\r\n      see only our weakness and His greatness....”\nPierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason’s face with\r\n      shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with his\r\n      whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise reasoning\r\n      contained in the Mason’s words, or believed as a child believes, in the\r\n      speaker’s tone of conviction and earnestness, or the tremor of the\r\n      speaker’s voice—which sometimes almost broke—or those\r\n      brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm firmness and\r\n      certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole being (and which\r\n      struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and\r\n      hopelessness)—at any rate, Pierre longed with his whole soul to\r\n      believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort,\r\n      regeneration, and return to life.\n“He is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,” said the Mason.\n“I do not understand,” said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts\r\n      reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in the\r\n      Mason’s arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him. “I don’t\r\n      understand,” he said, “how it is that the mind of man cannot attain the\r\n      knowledge of which you speak.”\nThe Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.\n“The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to\r\n      imbibe,” he said. “Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel\r\n      and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself can I\r\n      retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.”\n“Yes, yes, that is so,” said Pierre joyfully.\n“The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those worldly\r\n      sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into which\r\n      intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one. The highest\r\n      wisdom has but one science—the science of the whole—the\r\n      science explaining the whole creation and man’s place in it. To receive\r\n      that science it is necessary to purify and renew one’s inner self, and so\r\n      before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to perfect one’s self.\r\n      And to attain this end, we have the light called conscience that God has\r\n      implanted in our souls.”\n“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.\n“Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask thyself\r\n      whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained relying on\r\n      reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you are clever,\r\n      you are well educated. And what have you done with all these good gifts?\r\n      Are you content with yourself and with your life?”\n“No, I hate my life,” Pierre muttered, wincing.\n“Thou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art purified,\r\n      thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir. How have you spent\r\n      it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving everything from society\r\n      and giving nothing in return. You have become the possessor of wealth. How\r\n      have you used it? What have you done for your neighbor? Have you ever\r\n      thought of your tens of thousands of slaves? Have you helped them\r\n      physically and morally? No! You have profited by their toil to lead a\r\n      profligate life. That is what you have done. Have you chosen a post in\r\n      which you might be of service to your neighbor? No! You have spent your\r\n      life in idleness. Then you married, my dear sir—took on yourself\r\n      responsibility for the guidance of a young woman; and what have you done?\r\n      You have not helped her to find the way of truth, my dear sir, but have\r\n      thrust her into an abyss of deceit and misery. A man offended you and you\r\n      shot him, and you say you do not know God and hate your life. There is\r\n      nothing strange in that, my dear sir!”\nAfter these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again\r\n      leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre looked\r\n      at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved his lips\r\n      without uttering a sound. He wished to say, “Yes, a vile, idle, vicious\r\n      life!” but dared not break the silence.\nThe Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his\r\n      servant.\n“How about the horses?” he asked, without looking at Pierre.\n“The exchange horses have just come,” answered the servant. “Will you not\r\n      rest here?”\n“No, tell them to harness.”\n“Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me all,\r\n      and without promising to help me?” thought Pierre, rising with downcast\r\n      head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at the Mason.\r\n      “Yes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible and profligate\r\n      life, though I did not like it and did not want to,” thought Pierre. “But\r\n      this man knows the truth and, if he wished to, could disclose it to me.”\nPierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The traveler,\r\n      having packed his things with his practiced hands, began fastening his\r\n      coat. When he had finished, he turned to Bezúkhov, and said in a tone of\r\n      indifferent politeness:\n“Where are you going to now, my dear sir?”\n“I?... I’m going to Petersburg,” answered Pierre, in a childlike,\r\n      hesitating voice. “I thank you. I agree with all you have said. But do not\r\n      suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what you would\r\n      have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it is I, above\r\n      all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and perhaps I\r\n      may...”\nPierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.\nThe Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.\n“Help comes from God alone,” he said, “but such measure of help as our\r\n      Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to\r\n      Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski” (he took out his notebook and\r\n      wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four). “Allow me to\r\n      give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital, first of all\r\n      devote some time to solitude and self-examination and do not resume your\r\n      former way of life. And now I wish you a good journey, my dear sir,” he\r\n      added, seeing that his servant had entered... “and success.”\nThe traveler was Joseph Alexéevich Bazdéev, as Pierre saw from the\r\n      postmaster’s book. Bazdéev had been one of the best-known Freemasons and\r\n      Martinists, even in Novíkov’s time. For a long while after he had gone,\r\n      Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room,\r\n      pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense of beginning\r\n      anew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable, virtuous future\r\n      that seemed to him so easy. It seemed to him that he had been vicious only\r\n      because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous. Not a\r\n      trace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He firmly believed in the\r\n      possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one\r\n      another in the path of virtue, and that is how Freemasonry presented\r\n      itself to him."

    "text": "On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival, he\r\n      went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas à Kempis, whose book\r\n      had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually realized as\r\n      he read that book: the joy, hitherto unknown to him, of believing in the\r\n      possibility of attaining perfection, and in the possibility of active\r\n      brotherly love among men, which Joseph Alexéevich had revealed to him. A\r\n      week after his arrival, the young Polish count, Willarski, whom Pierre had\r\n      known slightly in Petersburg society, came into his room one evening in\r\n      the official and ceremonious manner in which Dólokhov’s second had called\r\n      on him, and, having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself that\r\n      there was nobody else in the room, addressed Pierre.\n“I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,” he said without\r\n      sitting down. “A person of very high standing in our Brotherhood has made\r\n      application for you to be received into our Order before the usual term\r\n      and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I consider it a sacred duty to\r\n      fulfill that person’s wishes. Do you wish to enter the Brotherhood of\r\n      Freemasons under my sponsorship?”\nThe cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met\r\n      at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women,\r\n      surprised Pierre.\n“Yes, I do wish it,” said he.\nWillarski bowed his head.\n“One more question, Count,” he said, “which I beg you to answer in all\r\n      sincerity—not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you\r\n      renounced your former convictions—do you believe in God?”\nPierre considered.\n“Yes... yes, I believe in God,” he said.\n“In that case...” began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.\n“Yes, I do believe in God,” he repeated.\n“In that case we can go,” said Willarski. “My carriage is at your\r\n      service.”\nWillarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre’s inquiries as to\r\n      what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that\r\n      brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to\r\n      tell the truth.\nHaving entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its\r\n      headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small\r\n      well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of a\r\n      servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange attire\r\n      appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said something to\r\n      him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small wardrobe in\r\n      which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before. Having\r\n      taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound Pierre’s eyes with it\r\n      and tied it in a knot behind, catching some hairs painfully in the knot.\r\n      Then he drew his face down, kissed him, and taking him by the hand led him\r\n      forward. The hairs tied in the knot hurt Pierre and there were lines of\r\n      pain on his face and a shamefaced smile. His huge figure, with arms\r\n      hanging down and with a puckered, though smiling face, moved after\r\n      Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.\nHaving led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.\n“Whatever happens to you,” he said, “you must bear it all manfully if you\r\n      have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.” (Pierre nodded\r\n      affirmatively.) “When you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover your\r\n      eyes,” added Willarski. “I wish you courage and success,” and, pressing\r\n      Pierre’s hand, he went out.\nLeft alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice he\r\n      shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if wishing\r\n      to take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent with his\r\n      eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb, his legs almost\r\n      gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He experienced a variety\r\n      of most complex sensations. He felt afraid of what would happen to him and\r\n      still more afraid of showing his fear. He felt curious to know what was\r\n      going to happen and what would be revealed to him; but most of all, he\r\n      felt joyful that the moment had come when he would at last start on that\r\n      path of regeneration and on the actively virtuous life of which he had\r\n      been dreaming since he met Joseph Alexéevich. Loud knocks were heard at\r\n      the door. Pierre took the bandage off his eyes and glanced around him. The\r\n      room was in black darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside something\r\n      white. Pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on\r\n      which lay an open book. The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with\r\n      the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth. After\r\n      reading the first words of the Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word and\r\n      the Word was with God,” Pierre went round the table and saw a large open\r\n      box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones inside. He was not\r\n      at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life\r\n      quite unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even more\r\n      unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospel—it\r\n      seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more. Trying to\r\n      stimulate his emotions he looked around. “God, death, love, the\r\n      brotherhood of man,” he kept saying to himself, associating these words\r\n      with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and someone came in.\nBy the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he saw a\r\n      rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the darkness,\r\n      the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the table and placed\r\n      on it his small leather-gloved hands.\nThis short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and\r\n      part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high\r\n      white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from below.\n“For what have you come hither?” asked the newcomer, turning in Pierre’s\r\n      direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. “Why have you, who do not\r\n      believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light, come\r\n      here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?”\nAt the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a\r\n      sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at\r\n      confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete\r\n      stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated\r\n      breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the\r\n      brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was\r\n      known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew,\r\n      Smolyanínov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an\r\n      acquaintance—he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous\r\n      instructor. For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor\r\n      had to repeat his question.\n“Yes... I... I... desire regeneration,” Pierre uttered with difficulty.\n“Very well,” said Smolyanínov, and went on at once: “Have you any idea of\r\n      the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your aim?” said\r\n      he quietly and quickly.\n“I... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,” said Pierre, with\r\n      a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his excitement\r\n      and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in Russian.\n“What is your conception of Freemasonry?”\n“I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who have\r\n      virtuous aims,” said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of his\r\n      words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. “I imagine...”\n“Good!” said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this answer.\r\n      “Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?”\n“No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,” said Pierre, so\r\n      softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying.\r\n      “I have been an atheist,” answered Pierre.\n“You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,\r\n      therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?” said the Rhetor,\r\n      after a moment’s pause.\n“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.\nThe Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast, and\r\n      began to speak.\n“Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,” he said, “and if\r\n      this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood with profit.\r\n      The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on which it rests\r\n      and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation and handing on\r\n      to posterity of a certain important mystery... which has come down to us\r\n      from the remotest ages, even from the first man—a mystery on which\r\n      perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this mystery is of such a\r\n      nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and\r\n      diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope to attain it quickly.\r\n      Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing our members as much as\r\n      possible to reform their hearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by\r\n      means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain\r\n      this mystery, and thereby to render them capable of receiving it.\n“By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve the\r\n      whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety and\r\n      virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which sways\r\n      the world. Think this over and I will come to you again.”\n“To combat the evil which sways the world...” Pierre repeated, and a\r\n      mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind. He\r\n      imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he addressed\r\n      an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself vicious and\r\n      unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed, imagined\r\n      oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three objects mentioned\r\n      by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind, especially appealed\r\n      to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the Rhetor, though it\r\n      aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential, and the second aim,\r\n      that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not much interest him\r\n      because at that moment he felt with delight that he was already perfectly\r\n      cured of his former faults and was ready for all that was good.\nHalf an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the seven\r\n      virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon’s temple, which every\r\n      Freemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were: 1.Discretion,\r\n      the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2.Obedienceto those of higher\r\n      ranks in the Order. 3.Morality. 4.Love of mankind. 5.Courage.\r\n      6.Generosity. 7.The love of death.\n“In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death,” the Rhetor\r\n      said, “to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but as a\r\n      friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this\r\n      distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and peace.”\n“Yes, that must be so,” thought Pierre, when after these words the Rhetor\r\n      went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. “It must be so, but I am\r\n      still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only now\r\n      gradually opening before me.” But five of the other virtues which Pierre\r\n      recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt already in his soul:courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind, and especiallyobedience—which\r\n      did not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now felt so glad to be\r\n      free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to those who knew the\r\n      indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh virtue was and could not\r\n      recall it.\nThe third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre whether\r\n      he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to all that\r\n      would be required of him.\n“I am ready for everything,” said Pierre.\n“I must also inform you,” said the Rhetor, “that our Order delivers its\r\n      teaching not in words only but also by other means, which may perhaps have\r\n      a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than mere\r\n      words. This chamber with what you see therein should already have\r\n      suggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than words could do. You\r\n      will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method of\r\n      enlightenment. Our Order imitates the ancient societies that explained\r\n      their teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,” said the Rhetor, “is an\r\n      emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but which possesses\r\n      qualities resembling those of the symbol.”\nPierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He\r\n      listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his\r\n      ordeal was about to begin.\n“If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,” said the Rhetor\r\n      coming closer to Pierre. “In token of generosity I ask you to give me all\r\n      your valuables.”\n“But I have nothing here,” replied Pierre, supposing that he was asked to\r\n      give up all he possessed.\n“What you have with you: watch, money, rings....”\nPierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for some\r\n      time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been done,\r\n      the Rhetor said:\n“In token of obedience, I ask you to undress.”\nPierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the\r\n      Rhetor’s instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre’s left\r\n      breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above\r\n      the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also and was\r\n      going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the trouble,\r\n      but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a slipper for\r\n      his left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment, doubt, and\r\n      self-derision, which appeared on his face against his will, Pierre stood\r\n      with his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his brother Rhetor, and\r\n      awaited his further commands.\n“And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief\r\n      passion,” said the latter.\n“My passion! I have had so many,” replied Pierre.\n“That passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path\r\n      of virtue,” said the Mason.\nPierre paused, seeking a reply.\n“Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?” He went\r\n      over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give the\r\n      pre-eminence.\n“Women,” he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.\nThe Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this answer.\r\n      At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay on the\r\n      table, again bound his eyes.\n“For the last time I say to you—turn all your attention upon\r\n      yourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in\r\n      passion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not without us\r\n      but within....”\nPierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source of\r\n      blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion."

    "text": "Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not the\r\n      Rhetor but Pierre’s sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his voice.\r\n      To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre replied:\r\n      “Yes, yes, I agree,” and with a beaming, childlike smile, his fat chest\r\n      uncovered, stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and one booted\r\n      foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his bare chest. He was\r\n      conducted from that room along passages that turned backwards and forwards\r\n      and was at last brought to the doors of the Lodge. Willarski coughed, he\r\n      was answered by the Masonic knock with mallets, the doors opened before\r\n      them. A bass voice (Pierre was still blindfolded) questioned him as to who\r\n      he was, when and where he was born, and so on. Then he was again led\r\n      somewhere still blindfolded, and as they went along he was told allegories\r\n      of the toils of his pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal\r\n      Architect of the universe, and of the courage with which he should endure\r\n      toils and dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was\r\n      spoken of now as the “Seeker,” now as the “Sufferer,” and now as the\r\n      “Postulant,” to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and\r\n      swords. As he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and\r\n      uncertainty among his conductors. He heard those around him disputing in\r\n      whispers and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain\r\n      carpet. After that they took his right hand, placed it on something, and\r\n      told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other\r\n      hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the\r\n      laws of the Order. The candles were then extinguished and some spirit\r\n      lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and he was told that he would now\r\n      see the lesser light. The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the faint\r\n      light of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men\r\n      standing before him, wearing aprons like the Rhetor’s and holding swords\r\n      in their hands pointed at his breast. Among them stood a man whose white\r\n      shirt was stained with blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with\r\n      his breast toward the swords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords\r\n      were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded again.\n“Now thou hast seen the lesser light,” uttered a voice. Then the candles\r\n      were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the bandage\r\n      was again removed and more than ten voices said together:“Sic transit\r\n      gloria mundi.”\nPierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room and\r\n      at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some twelve\r\n      men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them Pierre had\r\n      met in Petersburg society. In the President’s chair sat a young man he did\r\n      not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck. On his right sat\r\n      the Italian abbé whom Pierre had met at Anna Pávlovna’s two years before.\r\n      There were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had\r\n      formerly been tutor at the Kurágins’. All maintained a solemn silence,\r\n      listening to the words of the President, who held a mallet in his hand.\r\n      Let into the wall was a star-shaped light. At one side of the table was a\r\n      small carpet with various figures worked upon it, at the other was\r\n      something resembling an altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round\r\n      it stood seven large candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the\r\n      brothers led Pierre up to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and\r\n      bade him lie down, saying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of\r\n      the Temple.\n“He must first receive the trowel,” whispered one of the brothers.\n“Oh, hush, please!” said another.\nPierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without\r\n      obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. “Where am I? What am I\r\n      doing? Aren’t they laughing at me? Shan’t I be ashamed to remember this?”\r\n       But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at the serious faces\r\n      of those around, remembered all he had already gone through, and realized\r\n      that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast at his hesitation and,\r\n      trying to arouse his former devotional feeling, prostrated himself before\r\n      the Gates of the Temple. And really, the feeling of devotion returned to\r\n      him even more strongly than before. When he had lain there some time, he\r\n      was told to get up, and a white leather apron, such as the others wore,\r\n      was put on him: he was given a trowel and three pairs of gloves, and then\r\n      the Grand Master addressed him. He told him that he should try to do\r\n      nothing to stain the whiteness of that apron, which symbolized strength\r\n      and purity; then of the unexplained trowel, he told him to toil with it to\r\n      cleanse his own heart from vice, and indulgently to smooth with it the\r\n      heart of his neighbor. As to the first pair of gloves, a man’s, he said\r\n      that Pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them. The second\r\n      pair of man’s gloves he was to wear at the meetings, and finally of the\r\n      third, a pair of women’s gloves, he said: “Dear brother, these woman’s\r\n      gloves are intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall\r\n      honor most of all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to\r\n      her whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry.” And after a\r\n      pause, he added: “But beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not deck\r\n      hands that are unclean.” While the Grand Master said these last words it\r\n      seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still more\r\n      confused, blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes, began looking\r\n      about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed.\nThis silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the\r\n      rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of all\r\n      the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a trowel, a\r\n      rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and so on. Then\r\n      a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of the Lodge, told\r\n      the password, and at last was permitted to sit down. The Grand Master\r\n      began reading the statutes. They were very long, and Pierre, from joy,\r\n      agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to understand what was\r\n      being read. He managed to follow only the last words of the statutes and\r\n      these remained in his mind.\n“In our temples we recognize no other distinctions,” read the Grand\r\n      Master, “but those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any\r\n      distinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother’s aid whoever\r\n      he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth, never bear\r\n      malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous. Kindle in\r\n      all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy neighbor, and\r\n      may envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do not\r\n      avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling the highest law\r\n      thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which thou hast lost.”\nHe finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears\r\n      of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the\r\n      congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all\r\n      sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only\r\n      brothers, and burned with impatience to set to work with them.\nThe Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down in their\r\n      places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of humility.\nThe Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed, and the\r\n      distinguished dignitary who bore the title of “Collector of Alms” went\r\n      round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked to subscribe all he\r\n      had, but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same amount\r\n      as the others.\nThe meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had\r\n      returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had\r\n      become completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits and\r\n      way of life."

    "text": "The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at\r\n      home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,\r\n      one side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third physical\r\n      things, and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then his attention\r\n      wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in imagination a new\r\n      plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he had heard that a\r\n      rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it would be wiser for\r\n      him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his estates in the south\r\n      and there attending to the welfare of his serfs. He was joyfully planning\r\n      this new life, when Prince Vasíli suddenly entered the room.\n“My dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you\r\n      quarreled with Hélène,mon cher?You are under a delusion,” said Prince\r\n      Vasíli, as he entered. “I know all about it, and I can tell you positively\r\n      that Hélène is as innocent before you as Christ was before the Jews.”\nPierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasíli interrupted him.\n“And why didn’t you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I know all\r\n      about it and understand it all,” he said. “You behaved as becomes a man\r\n      who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won’t go into that. But\r\n      consider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes of\r\n      society, and even of the court,” he added, lowering his voice. “She is\r\n      living in Moscow and you are here. Remember, dear boy,” and he drew\r\n      Pierre’s arm downwards, “it is simply a misunderstanding. I expect you\r\n      feel it so yourself. Let us write her a letter at once, and she’ll come\r\n      here and all will be explained, or else, my dear boy, let me tell you it’s\r\n      quite likely you’ll have to suffer for it.”\nPrince Vasíli gave Pierre a significant look.\n“I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a keen\r\n      interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to Hélène.”\nPierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vasíli did\r\n      not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to speak in\r\n      the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly\r\n      resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the Masonic\r\n      statutes, “be kindly and courteous,” recurred to him. He blinked, went\r\n      red, got up and sat down again, struggling with himself to do what was for\r\n      him the most difficult thing in life—to say an unpleasant thing to a\r\n      man’s face, to say what the other, whoever he might be, did not expect. He\r\n      was so used to submitting to Prince Vasíli’s tone of careless\r\n      self-assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now, but he\r\n      also felt that on what he said now his future depended—whether he\r\n      would follow the same old road, or that new path so attractively shown him\r\n      by the Masons, on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new\r\n      life.\n“Now, dear boy,” said Prince Vasíli playfully, “say ‘yes,’ and I’ll write\r\n      to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.”\nBut before Prince Vasíli had finished his playful speech, Pierre, without\r\n      looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his father,\r\n      muttered in a whisper:\n“Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!” And he jumped up and\r\n      opened the door for him.\n“Go!” he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of confusion\r\n      and fear that showed itself on Prince Vasíli’s face.\n“What’s the matter with you? Are you ill?”\n“Go!” the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vasíli had to go without\r\n      receiving any explanation.\nA week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons,\r\n      and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his\r\n      estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons\r\n      and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity."

    "text": "The duel between Pierre and Dólokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the\r\n      Emperor’s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the principals\r\n      nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel, confirmed by\r\n      Pierre’s rupture with his wife, was the talk of society. Pierre who had\r\n      been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate\r\n      son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia, had\r\n      sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage—when the\r\n      marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from him—especially\r\n      as he did not know how, and did not wish, to court society’s favor. Now he\r\n      alone was blamed for what had happened, he was said to be insanely jealous\r\n      and subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after\r\n      Pierre’s departure Hélène returned to Petersburg, she was received by all\r\n      her acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade of deference\r\n      due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her husband Hélène\r\n      assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic tact she had\r\n      acquired though she did not understand its significance. This expression\r\n      suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and\r\n      that her husband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince Vasíli expressed\r\n      his opinion more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was\r\n      mentioned and, pointing to his forehead, remarked:\n“A bit touched—I always said so.”\n“I said from the first,” declared Anna Pávlovna referring to Pierre, “I\r\n      said at the time and before anyone else” (she insisted on her priority)\r\n      “that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of these\r\n      days. I said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures about him,\r\n      when he had just returned from abroad, and when, if you remember, he posed\r\n      as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees. And how has it ended? I was\r\n      against this marriage even then and foretold all that has happened.”\nAnna Pávlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees\r\n      as before—such as she alone had the gift of arranging—at which\r\n      was to be found “the cream of really good society, the bloom of the\r\n      intellectual essence of Petersburg,” as she herself put it. Besides this\r\n      refined selection of society Anna Pávlovna’s receptions were also\r\n      distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and\r\n      interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state of\r\n      the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court society so dearly\r\n      and distinctly indicated.\nToward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon’s destruction\r\n      of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstädt and the surrender of most of\r\n      the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops had already\r\n      entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon was beginning, Anna\r\n      Pávlovna gave one of her soirees. The “cream of really good society”\r\n       consisted of the fascinating Hélène, forsaken by her husband, Mortemart,\r\n      the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had just returned from Vienna, two\r\n      diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man referred to in that drawing room\r\n      as “a man of great merit” (un homme de beaucoup de mérite), a newly\r\n      appointed maid of honor and her mother, and several other less noteworthy\r\n      persons.\nThe novelty Anna Pávlovna was setting before her guests that evening was\r\n      Borís Drubetskóy, who had just arrived as a special messenger from the\r\n      Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.\nThe temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that\r\n      evening was this:\n“Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance\r\n      Bonaparte, and to causeme, andusin general, annoyance and\r\n      mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease\r\n      to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the King\r\n      of Prussia and others: ‘So much the worse for you.Tu l’as voulu, George\r\n      Dandin,’ that’s all we have to say about it!”\nWhen Borís, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing\r\n      room, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided\r\n      by Anna Pávlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and the\r\n      hope of an alliance with her.\nBorís, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed,\r\n      entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an\r\n      aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and\r\n      then brought back to the general circle.\nAnna Pávlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to\r\n      several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description\r\n      of each.\n“Prince Hippolyte Kurágin—charming young fellow; M. Kronq,—chargé\r\n      d’affaires from Copenhagen—a profound intellect,” and simply,\r\n      “Mr. Shítov—a man of great merit”—this of the man\r\n      usually so described.\nThanks to Anna Mikháylovna’s efforts, his own tastes, and the\r\n      peculiarities of his reserved nature, Borís had managed during his service\r\n      to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a very\r\n      important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia,\r\n      and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had become\r\n      thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so\r\n      pleased at Olmütz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably\r\n      higher than a general, and according to which what was needed for success\r\n      in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or perseverance, but\r\n      only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards, and\r\n      he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the\r\n      inability of others to understand these things. In consequence of this\r\n      discovery his whole manner of life, all his relations with old friends,\r\n      all his plans for his future, were completely altered. He was not rich,\r\n      but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others, and would\r\n      rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in\r\n      a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old\r\n      uniform. He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those\r\n      above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him. He liked\r\n      Petersburg and despised Moscow. The remembrance of the Rostóvs’ house and\r\n      of his childish love for Natásha was unpleasant to him and he had not once\r\n      been to see the Rostóvs since the day of his departure for the army. To be\r\n      in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room he considered an important step up in the\r\n      service, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make use\r\n      of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned each\r\n      face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with each of\r\n      those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took the seat\r\n      indicated to him beside the fair Hélène and listened to the general\r\n      conversation.\n“Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that\r\n      not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them, and\r\n      she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the actual phrase\r\n      used by the Vienna cabinet,” said the Danish chargé d’affaires.\n“The doubt is flattering,” said “the man of profound intellect,” with a\r\n      subtle smile.\n“We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of\r\n      Austria,” said Mortemart. “The Emperor of Austria can never have thought\r\n      of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.”\n“Ah, my dear vicomte,” put in Anna Pávlovna,“L’Urope”(for some reason she called itUropeas if that were a specially refined French\r\n      pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a\r\n      Frenchman),“L’Urope ne sera jamais notre alliée sincère.”*\n* “Europe will never be our sincere ally.”\nAfter that Anna Pávlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King of\r\n      Prussia, in order to draw Borís into the conversation.\nBorís listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn, but\r\n      managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the beautiful\r\n      Hélène, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome young\r\n      aide-de-camp with a smile.\nSpeaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pávlovna very naturally asked\r\n      Borís to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he found\r\n      the Prussian army. Borís, speaking with deliberation, told them in pure,\r\n      correct French many interesting details about the armies and the court,\r\n      carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about the facts\r\n      he was recounting. For some time he engrossed the general attention, and\r\n      Anna Pávlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with\r\n      pleasure by all her visitors. The greatest attention of all to Borís’\r\n      narrative was shown by Hélène. She asked him several questions about his\r\n      journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian army.\r\n      As soon as he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile.\n“You absolutely must come and see me,” she said in a tone that implied\r\n      that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was absolutely\r\n      necessary.\n“On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.”\nBorís promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation\r\n      with her, when Anna Pávlovna called him away on the pretext that her aunt\r\n      wished to hear him.\n“You know her husband, of course?” said Anna Pávlovna, closing her eyes\r\n      and indicating Hélène with a sorrowful gesture. “Ah, she is such an\r\n      unfortunate and charming woman! Don’t mention him before her—please\r\n      don’t! It is too painful for her!”"

    "text": "When Borís and Anna Pávlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte had\r\n      the ear of the company.\nBending forward in his armchair he said:“Le Roi de Prusse!”and having\r\n      said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.\n“Le Roi de Prusse?”Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing, and\r\n      then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna Pávlovna waited for\r\n      him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she began to\r\n      tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the sword of\r\n      Frederick the Great.\n“It is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...” she began, but\r\n      Hippolyte interrupted her with the words:“Le Roi de Prusse...”and again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no more.\nAnna Pávlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyte’s friend, addressed him\r\n      firmly.\n“Come now, what about yourRoi de Prusse?”\nHippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.\n“Oh, it’s nothing. I only wished to say...” (he wanted to repeat a joke he\r\n      had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to get\r\n      in) “I only wished to say that we are wrong to fightpour le Roi de\r\n      Prusse!”\nBorís smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical or\r\n      appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody\r\n      laughed.\n“Your joke is too bad, it’s witty but unjust,” said Anna Pávlovna, shaking\r\n      her little shriveled finger at him.\n“We are not fightingpour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles. Oh,\r\n      that wicked Prince Hippolyte!” she said.\nThe conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the\r\n      political news. It became particularly animated toward the end of the\r\n      evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.\n“You know N— N— received a snuffbox with the portrait last\r\n      year?” said “the man of profound intellect.” “Why shouldn’t S— S—\r\n      get the same distinction?”\n“Pardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperor’s portrait is a reward but not a\r\n      distinction,” said the diplomatist—“a gift, rather.”\n“There are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.”\n“It’s impossible,” replied another.\n“Will you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter....”\nWhen everybody rose to go, Hélène who had spoken very little all the\r\n      evening again turned to Borís, asking him in a tone of caressing\r\n      significant command to come to her on Tuesday.\n“It is of great importance to me,” she said, turning with a smile toward\r\n      Anna Pávlovna, and Anna Pávlovna, with the same sad smile with which she\r\n      spoke of her exalted patroness, supported Hélène’s wish.\nIt seemed as if from some words Borís had spoken that evening about the\r\n      Prussian army, Hélène had suddenly found it necessary to see him. She\r\n      seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on\r\n      Tuesday.\nBut on Tuesday evening, having come to Hélène’s splendid salon, Borís\r\n      received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to\r\n      come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to him, and\r\n      only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a\r\n      whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: “Come to dinner tomorrow... in\r\n      the evening. You must come.... Come!”\nDuring that stay in Petersburg, Borís became an intimate in the countess’\r\n      house."

    "text": "The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere one\r\n      heard curses on Bonaparte, “the enemy of mankind.” Militiamen and recruits\r\n      were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of war came\r\n      contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously interpreted.\r\n      The life of old Prince Bolkónski, Prince Andrew, and Princess Mary had\r\n      greatly changed since 1805.\nIn 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief then\r\n      appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia. Despite\r\n      the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable since the\r\n      time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think it right to\r\n      refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor himself, and\r\n      this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and strength. He was\r\n      continually traveling through the three provinces entrusted to him, was\r\n      pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe to cruel with his\r\n      subordinates, and went into everything down to the minutest details\r\n      himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from her\r\n      father, and when the old prince was at home went to his study with the wet\r\n      nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his grandfather called him). The baby\r\n      Prince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse Sávishna in the late\r\n      princess’ rooms and Princess Mary spent most of the day in the nursery,\r\n      taking a mother’s place to her little nephew as best she could.\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed passionately fond of the boy, and\r\n      Princess Mary often deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of\r\n      dandling the littleangel—as she called her nephew—and playing\r\n      with him.\nNear the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the\r\n      tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument\r\n      brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to\r\n      fly upwards. The angel’s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to\r\n      smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess\r\n      Mary admitted to one another that the angel’s face reminded them strangely\r\n      of the little princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince\r\n      Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor\r\n      had happened to give the angel’s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild\r\n      reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: “Ah, why have you done\r\n      this to me?”\nSoon after Prince Andrew’s return the old prince made over to him a large\r\n      estate, Boguchárovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly\r\n      because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly\r\n      because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his\r\n      father’s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince\r\n      Andrew made use of Boguchárovo, began building and spent most of his time\r\n      there.\nAfter the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to\r\n      continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and everybody\r\n      had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to\r\n      avoid active service. The old prince and his son seemed to have changed\r\n      roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man, roused by activity,\r\n      expected the best results from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on\r\n      the contrary, taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw\r\n      only the dark side.\nOn February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.\r\n      Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father’s absence.\r\n      Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who had driven\r\n      the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for Prince\r\n      Andrew.\nNot finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the letters\r\n      to Princess Mary’s apartments, but did not find him there. He was told\r\n      that the prince had gone to the nursery.\n“If you please, your excellency, Pétrusha has brought some papers,” said\r\n      one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a child’s little\r\n      chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he poured drops from a\r\n      medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.\n“What is it?” he said crossly, and, his hand shaking unintentionally, he\r\n      poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the mixture onto the floor\r\n      and asked for some more water. The maid brought it.\nThere were in the room a child’s cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a table, a\r\n      child’s table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was sitting.\r\n      The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on the table,\r\n      screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall on the cot.\n“My dear,” said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside the cot\r\n      where she was standing, “better wait a bit... later...”\n“Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things off—and\r\n      this is what comes of it!” said Prince Andrew in an exasperated whisper,\r\n      evidently meaning to wound his sister.\n“My dear, really... it’s better not to wake him... he’s asleep,” said the\r\n      princess in a tone of entreaty.\nPrince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass in\r\n      hand.\n“Perhaps we’d really better not wake him,” he said hesitating.\n“As you please... really... I think so... but as you please,” said\r\n      Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had\r\n      prevailed. She drew her brother’s attention to the maid who was calling\r\n      him in a whisper.\nIt was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy\r\n      who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household\r\n      doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had been\r\n      trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness and\r\n      anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and reproached\r\n      and disputed with each other.\n“Pétrusha has come with papers from your father,” whispered the maid.\nPrince Andrew went out.\n“Devil take them!” he muttered, and after listening to the verbal\r\n      instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his\r\n      father’s letter, he returned to the nursery.\n“Well?” he asked.\n“Still the same. Wait, for heaven’s sake. Karl Ivánich always says that\r\n      sleep is more important than anything,” whispered Princess Mary with a\r\n      sigh.\nPrince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.\n“Confound you and your Karl Ivánich!” He took the glass with the drops and\r\n      again went up to the cot.\n“Andrew, don’t!” said Princess Mary.\nBut he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes, and\r\n      stooped glass in hand over the infant.\n“But I wish it,” he said. “I beg you—give it him!”\nPrincess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively and\r\n      calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed hoarsely.\r\n      Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat down on a\r\n      sofa in the next room.\nHe still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he\r\n      began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote in\r\n      his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:\nHave just this moment received by special messenger very joyful news—if\r\n      it’s not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over\r\n      Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing, and the rewards\r\n      sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a German—I\r\n      congratulate him! I can’t make out what the commander at Kórchevo—a\r\n      certain Khandrikóv—is up to; till now the additional men and\r\n      provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and say I’ll have\r\n      his head off if everything is not here in a week. Have received another\r\n      letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from Pétenka—he took part\r\n      in it—and it’s all true. When mischief-makers don’t meddle even a\r\n      German beats Buonaparte. He is said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind\r\n      you gallop off to Kórchevo without delay and carry out instructions!\nPrince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was a\r\n      closely written letter of two sheets from Bilíbin. He folded it up without\r\n      reading it and reread his father’s letter, ending with the words: “Gallop\r\n      off to Kórchevo and carry out instructions!”\n“No, pardon me, I won’t go now till the child is better,” thought he,\r\n      going to the door and looking into the nursery.\nPrincess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.\n“Ah yes, and what else did he say that’s unpleasant?” thought Prince\r\n      Andrew, recalling his father’s letter. “Yes, we have gained a victory over\r\n      Bonaparte, just when I’m not serving. Yes, yes, he’s always poking fun at\r\n      me.... Ah, well! Let him!” And he began reading Bilíbin’s letter which was\r\n      written in French. He read without understanding half of it, read only to\r\n      forget, if but for a moment, what he had too long been thinking of so\r\n      painfully to the exclusion of all else."

    "text": "Bilíbin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and though\r\n      he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms, he described\r\n      the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and self-derision\r\n      genuinely Russian. Bilíbin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic\r\n      discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince Andrew a\r\n      reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had\r\n      accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army. The\r\n      letter was old, having been written before the battle at Preussisch-Eylau.\n“Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,” wrote Bilíbin, “as\r\n      you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I have certainly\r\n      acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me; what I have seen\r\n      during these last three months is incredible.\n“I beginab ovo. ‘The enemy of the human race,’ as you know, attacks the\r\n      Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us\r\n      three times in three years. We take up their cause, but it turns out that\r\n      ‘the enemy of the human race’ pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his\r\n      rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them\r\n      time to finish the parade they had begun, and in two twists of the hand he\r\n      breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at Potsdam.\n“‘I most ardently desire,’ writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte, ‘that\r\n      Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner\r\n      agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances allowed, I have\r\n      hastened to take all steps to that end. May I have succeeded!’ The\r\n      Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay\r\n      down their arms at the first demand.\n“The head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the King\r\n      of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All this is\r\n      absolutely true.\n“In short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude, it\r\n      turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more, in war\r\n      on our own frontiers,withandforthe King of Prussia. We have everything\r\n      in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely, a commander in\r\n      chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success might have been\r\n      more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young, all our\r\n      octogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozoróvski and Kámenski the latter\r\n      was preferred. The general comes to us, Suvórov-like, in akibítka, and is\r\n      received with acclamations of joy and triumph.\n“On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails are\r\n      taken to the field marshal’s room, for he likes to do everything himself.\r\n      I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us. The\r\n      field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him. We search,\r\n      but none are to be found. The field marshal grows impatient and sets to\r\n      work himself and finds letters from the Emperor to Count T., Prince V.,\r\n      and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at\r\n      everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens them, and reads those\r\n      from the Emperor addressed to others. ‘Ah! So that’s the way they treat\r\n      me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep an eye on me! Very well then!\r\n      Get along with you!’ So he writes the famous order of the day to General\r\n      Bennigsen:\n“‘I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the\r\n      army. You have brought your army corps to Pultúsk, routed: here it is exposed,\r\n      and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as you\r\n      yourself reported to Count Buxhöwden yesterday, you must think of\r\n      retreating to our frontier—which do today.’\n“‘From all my riding,’ he writes to the Emperor, ‘I have got a saddle sore\r\n      which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents my riding and\r\n      commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the command to the general\r\n      next in seniority, Count Buxhöwden, having sent him my whole staff and all\r\n      that belongs to it, advising him if there is a lack of bread, to move\r\n      farther into the interior of Prussia, for only one day’s ration of bread\r\n      remains, and in some regiments none at all, as reported by the division\r\n      commanders, Ostermann and Sedmorétzki, and all that the peasants had has\r\n      been eaten up. I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I\r\n      recover. In regard to which I humbly submit my report, with the\r\n      information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another\r\n      fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring.\n“‘Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already\r\n      in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious\r\n      task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious permission\r\n      here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of asecretaryrather thancommanderin the army. My removal from the army does not\r\n      produce the slightest stir—a blind man has left it. There are\r\n      thousands such as I in Russia.’\n“The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isn’t\r\n      it logical?\n“This is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly\r\n      interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal’s departure it\r\n      appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.\r\n      Buxhöwden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does\r\n      not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are\r\n      within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to\r\n      fight a battle ‘on his own hand’ as the Germans say. He does so. This is\r\n      the battle of Pultúsk, which is considered a great victory but in my\r\n      opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very\r\n      bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat\r\n      after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we\r\n      who lost the battle of Pultúsk. In short, we retreat after the battle but\r\n      send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General\r\n      Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in\r\n      chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the\r\n      army to General Buxhöwden. During this interregnum we begin a very\r\n      original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it\r\n      should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General\r\n      Buxhöwden who by right of seniority should be our chief. So energetically\r\n      do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the\r\n      bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at the moment is not\r\n      Bonaparte but Buxhöwden. General Buxhöwden was all but attacked and\r\n      captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers\r\n      that enabled us to escape him. Buxhöwden pursues us—we scuttle. He\r\n      hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other. At\r\n      last our enemy, Buxhöwden, catches us and attacks. Both generals are\r\n      angry, and the result is a challenge on Buxhöwden’s part and an epileptic\r\n      fit on Bennigsen’s. But at the critical moment the courier who carried the\r\n      news of our victory at Pultúsk to Petersburg returns bringing our\r\n      appointment as commander in chief, and our first foe, Buxhöwden, is\r\n      vanquished; we can now turn our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But as\r\n      it turns out, just at that moment a third enemy rises before us—namely\r\n      theOrthodox Russian soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits,\r\n      fodder, and whatnot! The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The\r\n      Orthodox begin looting, and in a way of which our last campaign can give\r\n      you no idea. Half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and\r\n      put everything to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the\r\n      hospitals overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the\r\n      marauders even attack our headquarters, and the commander in chief has to\r\n      ask for a battalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks they\r\n      carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor\r\n      proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders,\r\n      but I much fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.”\nAt first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while, in\r\n      spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust Bilíbin),\r\n      what he had read began to interest him more and more. When he had read\r\n      thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was not what he\r\n      had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out there in which he\r\n      had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes, rubbed his forehead\r\n      as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read, and listened to\r\n      what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he thought he heard a strange\r\n      noise through the door. He was seized with alarm lest something should\r\n      have happened to the child while he was reading the letter. He went on\r\n      tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.\nJust as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him\r\n      with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.\n“My dear,” he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him.\nAs often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was seized\r\n      by an unreasoning panic—it occurred to him that the child was dead.\r\n      All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.\n“All is over,” he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He\r\n      went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it empty and that\r\n      the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the curtain aside and for\r\n      some time his frightened, restless eyes could not find the baby. At last\r\n      he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with\r\n      his head lower than the pillow, and was smacking his lips in his sleep and\r\n      breathing evenly.\nPrince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had already\r\n      lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him, tried with\r\n      his lips whether the child was still feverish. The soft forehead was\r\n      moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand; even the hair was\r\n      wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was not dead, but evidently\r\n      the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince Andrew longed to\r\n      snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless little\r\n      creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his head and\r\n      at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He heard a\r\n      rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot. He\r\n      did not look round, but still gazing at the infant’s face listened to his\r\n      regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary, who had come up to\r\n      the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain, and dropped it again\r\n      behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her without looking and held out his\r\n      hand to her. She pressed it.\n“He has perspired,” said Prince Andrew.\n“I was coming to tell you so.”\nThe child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead\r\n      against the pillow.\nPrince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her\r\n      luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that\r\n      were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly\r\n      catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture and\r\n      stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing to\r\n      leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the world.\r\n      Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair against the\r\n      muslin of the curtain.\n“Yes, this is the one thing left me now,” he said with a sigh."

    "text": "Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the\r\n      Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with him\r\n      full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what\r\n      he should do on his estates.\nWhen he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and\r\n      explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps would\r\n      be taken immediately to free his serfs—and that till then they were\r\n      not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies were\r\n      not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs,\r\n      punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals,\r\n      asylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates. Some of\r\n      the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with\r\n      alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased\r\n      with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first\r\n      fright were amused by Pierre’s lisp and the new words they had not heard\r\n      before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while the\r\n      cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from this\r\n      speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.\nThe chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre’s intentions, but\r\n      remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the\r\n      general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.\nDespite Count Bezúkhov’s enormous wealth, since he had come into an income\r\n      which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year, Pierre\r\n      felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of\r\n      ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the following budget:\nAbout 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about\r\n      30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house, and\r\n      the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in pensions\r\n      and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to the countess;\r\n      about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a new church,\r\n      previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two years, and\r\n      he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was spent, and almost\r\n      every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the chief steward wrote\r\n      every year telling him of fires and bad harvests, or of the necessity of\r\n      rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first task Pierre had to face\r\n      was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclination—practical\r\n      business.\nHe discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But he felt\r\n      that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these consultations\r\n      were detached from real affairs and did not link up with them or make them\r\n      move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state of things to him in\r\n      the very worst light, pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts\r\n      and undertaking new activities with serf labor, to which Pierre did not\r\n      agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to\r\n      liberate the serfs, which the steward met by showing the necessity of\r\n      first paying off the loans from the Land Bank, and the consequent\r\n      impossibility of a speedy emancipation.\nThe steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling the\r\n      forests in the province of Kostromá, the land lower down the river, and\r\n      the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which operations\r\n      according to him were connected with such complicated measures—the\r\n      removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so on—that Pierre\r\n      became quite bewildered and only replied:\n“Yes, yes, do so.”\nPierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him\r\n      to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to\r\n      pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward for his\r\n      part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations\r\n      very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself.\nIn Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make\r\n      his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the largest\r\n      landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre’s greatest weakness—the\r\n      one to which he had confessed when admitted to the Lodge—were so\r\n      strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days, weeks, and months\r\n      of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with\r\n      evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him no time for\r\n      reflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead\r\n      he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.\nOf the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not\r\n      fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral\r\n      life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked two—morality and the\r\n      love of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled\r\n      another of the precepts—that of reforming the human race—and\r\n      had other virtues—love of his neighbor, and especially generosity.\nIn the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he\r\n      intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders\r\n      had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had\r\n      entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.\nThe chief steward, who considered the young count’s attempts almost insane—unprofitable\r\n      to himself, to the count, and to the serfs—made some concessions.\r\n      Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable, he\r\n      arranged for the erection of large buildings—schools, hospitals, and\r\n      asylums—on all the estates before the master arrived. Everywhere\r\n      preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre\r\n      would not like), but for just such gratefully religious ones, with\r\n      offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality, as, according to\r\n      his understanding of his master, would touch and delude him.\nThe southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage,\r\n      and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on Pierre. The\r\n      estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the\r\n      other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for\r\n      the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions, which though\r\n      they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his\r\n      heart. In one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an\r\n      icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission, as a mark of their\r\n      gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them, to build a new\r\n      chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul, his\r\n      patron saints. In another place the women with infants in arms met him to\r\n      thank him for releasing them from hard work. On a third estate the priest,\r\n      bearing a cross, came to meet him surrounded by children whom, by the\r\n      count’s generosity, he was instructing in reading, writing, and religion.\r\n      On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or\r\n      in course of erection, all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and\r\n      almshouses, which were soon to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewards’\r\n      accounts, according to which the serfs’ manorial labor had been\r\n      diminished, and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their\r\n      full-skirted blue coats.\nWhat Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with\r\n      bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul\r\n      was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter’s day, and that\r\n      the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun the chantry\r\n      long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in\r\n      a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that since the nursing\r\n      mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they did still harder\r\n      work on their own land. He did not know that the priest who met him with\r\n      the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and that the pupils’\r\n      parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their\r\n      release by heavy payments. He did not know that the brick buildings, built\r\n      to plan, were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus\r\n      increased, though lessened on paper. He did not know that where the\r\n      steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs’ payments had been\r\n      diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work had been increased\r\n      by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and\r\n      quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg,\r\n      and wrote enthusiastic letters to his “brother-instructor” as he called\r\n      the Grand Master.\n“How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,” thought\r\n      Pierre, “and how little attention we pay to it!”\nHe was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at receiving\r\n      it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these\r\n      simple, kindly people.\nThe chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through\r\n      the naïve and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy, seeing\r\n      the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre, pressed him still\r\n      harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of\r\n      freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.\nPierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be\r\n      difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would\r\n      happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly,\r\n      on what he thought right. The steward promised to do all in his power to\r\n      carry out the count’s wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the count\r\n      never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for the sale\r\n      of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank, but would\r\n      probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected\r\n      buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in\r\n      money and work all that other people’s serfs gave—that is to say,\r\n      all that could be got out of them."

    "text": "Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state of\r\n      mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his\r\n      friend Bolkónski, whom he had not seen for two years.\nBoguchárovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields\r\n      and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The house lay\r\n      behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks\r\n      still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that stretched along\r\n      the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees.\nThe homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a\r\n      bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular façade still\r\n      in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid out.\r\n      The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a water cart,\r\n      painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight, the bridges were\r\n      strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good\r\n      management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply to inquiries as to\r\n      where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the\r\n      pond. Antón, a man who had looked after Prince Andrew in his boyhood,\r\n      helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the prince was at home, and\r\n      showed him into a clean little anteroom.\nPierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the\r\n      brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in Petersburg.\nHe quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered\r\n      wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but Antón ran\r\n      ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.\n“Well, what is it?” came a sharp, unpleasant voice.\n“A visitor,” answered Antón.\n“Ask him to wait,” and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back.\nPierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face\r\n      with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre embraced\r\n      him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and looked\r\n      at him closely.\n“Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad,” said Prince Andrew.\nPierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He was\r\n      struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a smile\r\n      on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of\r\n      his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad\r\n      sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more manly-looking,\r\n      but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his\r\n      inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on\r\n      some one thought.\nAs is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation,\r\n      it was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They put\r\n      questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked\r\n      over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on some of the\r\n      topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans for the future,\r\n      Pierre’s journeys and occupations, the war, and so on. The preoccupation\r\n      and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend’s look was now\r\n      still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to\r\n      Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the\r\n      future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with\r\n      what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it\r\n      was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of\r\n      happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew’s presence. He was ashamed to\r\n      express his new Masonic views, which had been particularly revived and\r\n      strengthened by his late tour. He checked himself, fearing to seem naïve,\r\n      yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible\r\n      that he was now a quite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in\r\n      Petersburg.\n“I can’t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly know\r\n      myself again.”\n“Yes, we have altered much, very much, since then,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Well, and you? What are your plans?”\n“Plans!” repeated Prince Andrew ironically. “My plans?” he said, as if\r\n      astonished at the word. “Well, you see, I’m building. I mean to settle\r\n      here altogether next year....”\nPierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew’s face, which\r\n      had grown much older.\n“No, I meant to ask...” Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him.\n“But why talk of me?... Talktome, yes, tell me about your\r\n      travels and all you have been doing on your estates.”\nPierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far as\r\n      possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made.\r\n      Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre’s story of what he had been\r\n      doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened not only\r\n      without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him.\nPierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend’s company and\r\n      at last became silent.\n“I’ll tell you what, my dear fellow,” said Prince Andrew, who evidently\r\n      also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, “I am only\r\n      bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am going back to my\r\n      sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of course you know her\r\n      already,” he said, evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he\r\n      now found nothing in common. “We will go after dinner. And would you now\r\n      like to look round my place?”\nThey went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political\r\n      news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other\r\n      intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of\r\n      the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here,\r\n      while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future\r\n      arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:\n“However, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then\r\n      we’ll set off.”\nAt dinner, conversation turned on Pierre’s marriage.\n“I was very much surprised when I heard of it,” said Prince Andrew.\nPierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said\r\n      hurriedly: “I will tell you some time how it all happened. But you know it\r\n      is all over, and forever.”\n“Forever?” said Prince Andrew. “Nothing’s forever.”\n“But you know how it all ended, don’t you? You heard of the duel?”\n“And so you had to go through that too!”\n“One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,” said Pierre.\n“Why so?” asked Prince Andrew. “To kill a vicious dog is a very good thing\r\n      really.”\n“No, to kill a man is bad—wrong.”\n“Why is it wrong?” urged Prince Andrew. “It is not given to man to know\r\n      what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will err, and\r\n      in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.”\n“What does harm to another is wrong,” said Pierre, feeling with pleasure\r\n      that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused, had\r\n      begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to his present\r\n      state.\n“And who has told you what is bad for another man?” he asked.\n“Bad! Bad!” exclaimed Pierre. “We all know what is bad for ourselves.”\n“Yes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something\r\n      I cannot inflict on others,” said Prince Andrew, growing more and more\r\n      animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre. He\r\n      spoke in French. “I only know two very real evils in life: remorse and\r\n      illness. The only good is the absence of those evils. To live for myself\r\n      avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now.”\n“And love of one’s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?” began Pierre. “No, I\r\n      can’t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to\r\n      repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for myself and ruined my\r\n      life. And only now when I am living, or at least trying” (Pierre’s modesty\r\n      made him correct himself) “to live for others, only now have I understood\r\n      all the happiness of life. No, I shall not agree with you, and you do not\r\n      really believe what you are saying.” Prince Andrew looked silently at\r\n      Pierre with an ironic smile.\n“When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you’ll get on with her,” he said.\r\n      “Perhaps you are right for yourself,” he added after a short pause, “but\r\n      everyone lives in his own way. You lived for yourself and say you nearly\r\n      ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for\r\n      others. I experienced just the reverse. I lived for glory.—And after\r\n      all what is glory? The same love of others, a desire to do something for\r\n      them, a desire for their approval.—So I lived for others, and not\r\n      almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have become calmer since I began\r\n      to live only for myself.”\n“But what do you mean by living only for yourself?” asked Pierre, growing\r\n      excited. “What about your son, your sister, and your father?”\n“But that’s just the same as myself—they are notothers,” explained\r\n      Prince Andrew. “The others, one’s neighbors,le prochain, as you and\r\n      Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil.Le\r\n      prochain—your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.”\nAnd he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He\r\n      evidently wished to draw him on.\n“You are joking,” replied Pierre, growing more and more excited. “What\r\n      error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even doing a\r\n      little—though I did very little and did it very badly? What evil can\r\n      there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like ourselves,\r\n      were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies\r\n      and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in\r\n      future life, retribution, recompense, and consolation? What evil and error\r\n      are there in it, if people were dying of disease without help while\r\n      material assistance could so easily be rendered, and I supplied them with\r\n      a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum for the aged? And is it not a\r\n      palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no\r\n      rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure?” said Pierre, hurrying\r\n      and lisping. “And I have done that though badly and to a small extent; but\r\n      I have done something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not\r\n      a good action, and more than that, you can’t make me believe that you do\r\n      not think so yourself. And the main thing is,” he continued, “that I know,\r\n      and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only\r\n      sure happiness in life.”\n“Yes, if you put it like that it’s quite a different matter,” said Prince\r\n      Andrew. “I build a house and lay out a garden, and you build hospitals.\r\n      The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But what’s right and what’s\r\n      good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by us. Well, you want an\r\n      argument,” he added, “come on then.”\nThey rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served\r\n      as a veranda.\n“Come, let’s argue then,” said Prince Andrew, “You talk of schools,” he\r\n      went on, crooking a finger, “education and so forth; that is, you want to\r\n      raise him” (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap)\r\n      “from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs, while it\r\n      seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible, and that\r\n      is just what you want to deprive him of. I envy him, but you want to make\r\n      him what I am, without giving him my means. Then you say, ‘lighten his\r\n      toil.’ But as I see it, physical labor is as essential to him, as much a\r\n      condition of his existence, as mental activity is to you or me. You can’t\r\n      help thinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I\r\n      can’t sleep but toss about till dawn, because I think and can’t help\r\n      thinking, just as he can’t help plowing and mowing; if he didn’t, he would\r\n      go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible\r\n      physical labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my\r\n      physical idleness, but would grow fat and die. The third thing—what\r\n      else was it you talked about?” and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger.\r\n      “Ah, yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and\r\n      bleed him and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to\r\n      everybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler for\r\n      him to die. Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is.\r\n      It would be different if you grudged losing a laborer—that’s how I\r\n      regard him—but you want to cure him from love of him. And he does\r\n      not want that. And besides, what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone!\r\n      Killed them, yes!” said he, frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre.\nPrince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was\r\n      evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke\r\n      readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His\r\n      glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.\n“Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!” said Pierre. “I don’t understand how one\r\n      can live with such ideas. I had such moments myself not long ago, in\r\n      Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I collapsed so that I don’t\r\n      live at all—everything seems hateful to me... myself most of all.\r\n      Then I don’t eat, don’t wash... and how is it with you?...”\n“Why not wash? That is not cleanly,” said Prince Andrew; “on the contrary\r\n      one must try to make one’s life as pleasant as possible. I’m alive, that\r\n      is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I can without hurting\r\n      others.”\n“But with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit\r\n      without moving, undertaking nothing....”\n“Life as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do nothing,\r\n      but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to\r\n      choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get out of it.\r\n      They could not understand that I have not the necessary qualifications for\r\n      it—the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness necessary for the\r\n      position. Then there’s this house, which must be built in order to have a\r\n      nook of one’s own in which to be quiet. And now there’s this recruiting.”\n“Why aren’t you serving in the army?”\n“After Austerlitz!” said Prince Andrew gloomily. “No, thank you very much!\r\n      I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian army. And\r\n      I won’t—not even if Bonaparte were here at Smolénsk threatening Bald\r\n      Hills—even then I wouldn’t serve in the Russian army! Well, as I was\r\n      saying,” he continued, recovering his composure, “now there’s this\r\n      recruiting. My father is chief in command of the Third District, and my\r\n      only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him.”\n“Then you are serving?”\n“I am.”\nHe paused a little while.\n“And why do you serve?”\n“Why, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of his\r\n      time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too\r\n      energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is\r\n      terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the\r\n      recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late a\r\n      fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster’s clerk at Yúkhnovna hanged,”\r\n       said Prince Andrew with a smile. “So I am serving because I alone have any\r\n      influence with my father, and now and then can save him from actions which\r\n      would torment him afterwards.”\n“Well, there you see!”\n“Yes, but it is not as you imagine,” Prince Andrew continued. “I did not,\r\n      and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had\r\n      stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been very glad to\r\n      see him hanged, but I was sorry for my father—that again is for\r\n      myself.”\nPrince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly\r\n      while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no desire\r\n      to do good to his neighbor.\n“There now, you wish to liberate your serfs,” he continued; “that is a\r\n      very good thing, but not for you—I don’t suppose you ever had anyone\r\n      flogged or sent to Siberia—and still less for your serfs. If they\r\n      are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don’t suppose they are any the\r\n      worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the stripes on\r\n      their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is a good thing\r\n      for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon themselves, stifle\r\n      this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being able to inflict\r\n      punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I pity, and for their\r\n      sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You may not have seen, but I\r\n      have seen, how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power,\r\n      in time when they grow more irritable, become cruel and harsh, are\r\n      conscious of it, but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more\r\n      miserable.”\nPrince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking that\r\n      these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his father’s case.\nHe did not reply.\n“So that’s what I’m sorry for—human dignity, peace of mind, purity,\r\n      and not the serfs’ backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you may,\r\n      always remain the same backs and foreheads.”\n“No, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you,” said Pierre."

    "text": "In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to\r\n      Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and\r\n      then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.\nPointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in his\r\n      husbandry.\nPierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and apparently\r\n      immersed in his own thoughts.\nHe was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not\r\n      see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and\r\n      raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that\r\n      Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching,\r\n      and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what\r\n      to him was precious and sacred.\n“No, but why do you think so?” Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head\r\n      and looking like a bull about to charge, “why do you think so? You should\r\n      not think so.”\n“Think? What about?” asked Prince Andrew with surprise.\n“About life, about man’s destiny. It can’t be so. I myself thought like\r\n      that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don’t smile.\r\n      Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was:\r\n      Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, aspects of\r\n      humanity.”\nAnd he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew.\r\n      He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from the\r\n      bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood, and love.\n“Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest is a\r\n      dream,” said Pierre. “Understand, my dear fellow, that outside this union\r\n      all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing\r\n      is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life, like\r\n      you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our fundamental\r\n      convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up to us, let\r\n      yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I have felt\r\n      myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is\r\n      hidden in heaven,” said Pierre.\nPrince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to\r\n      Pierre’s words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented his\r\n      catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the peculiar\r\n      glow that came into Prince Andrew’s eyes and by his silence, Pierre saw\r\n      that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would not interrupt\r\n      him or laugh at what he said.\nThey reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to\r\n      cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it,\r\n      they also stepped on the raft.\nPrince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at the\r\n      flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.\n“Well, what do you think about it?” Pierre asked. “Why are you silent?”\n“What do I think about it? I am listening to you. It’s all very well....\r\n      You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life, the\r\n      destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who arewe?Men.\r\n      How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what you see? You\r\n      see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I don’t see it.”\nPierre interrupted him.\n“Do you believe in a future life?” he asked.\n“A future life?” Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no time to\r\n      reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he knew\r\n      Prince Andrew’s former atheistic convictions.\n“You say you can’t see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor could\r\n      I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of\r\n      everything. Onearth, here on this earth” (Pierre pointed to the fields),\r\n      “there is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the universe, in the\r\n      whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who are now the\r\n      children of earth are—eternally—children of the whole\r\n      universe. Don’t I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious\r\n      whole? Don’t I feel that I form one link, one step, between the lower and\r\n      higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the\r\n      Deity—the Supreme Power if you prefer the term—is manifest? If\r\n      I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I\r\n      suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther? I feel\r\n      that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this world, but that I\r\n      shall always exist and always have existed. I feel that beyond me and\r\n      above me there are spirits, and that in this world there is truth.”\n“Yes, that is Herder’s theory,” said Prince Andrew, “but it is not that\r\n      which can convince me, dear friend—life and death are what convince.\r\n      What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound up with one’s\r\n      own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right”\r\n       (Prince Andrew’s voice trembled and he turned away), “and suddenly that\r\n      being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to exist.... Why? It cannot\r\n      be that there is no answer. And I believe there is.... That’s what\r\n      convinces, that is what has convinced me,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Yes, yes, of course,” said Pierre, “isn’t that what I’m saying?”\n“No. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the\r\n      necessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with\r\n      someone and all at once that person vanishesthere, into nowhere, and you\r\n      yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked\r\n      in....”\n“Well, that’s it then! You know that there is athereand there is aSomeone? Thereis the future life. TheSomeoneis—God.”\nPrince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been\r\n      taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half\r\n      below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the\r\n      ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen,\r\n      coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.\n“If there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and man’s\r\n      highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must live, we\r\n      must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap\r\n      of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there, in the Whole,”\r\n       said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.\nPrince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to\r\n      Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun\r\n      gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre became\r\n      silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current\r\n      beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew felt as if the sound of the\r\n      waves kept up a refrain to Pierre’s words, whispering:\n“It is true, believe it.”\nHe sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at Pierre’s\r\n      face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his superior friend.\n“Yes, if it only were so!” said Prince Andrew. “However, it is time to get\r\n      on,” he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up at the sky to\r\n      which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that\r\n      high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield; and\r\n      something that had long been slumbering, something that was best within\r\n      him, suddenly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his soul. It vanished as soon\r\n      as he returned to the customary conditions of his life, but he knew that\r\n      this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him. His\r\n      meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrew’s life. Though\r\n      outwardly he continued to live in the same old way, inwardly he began a\r\n      new life."

    "text": "It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front\r\n      entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house, Prince\r\n      Andrew with a smile drew Pierre’s attention to a commotion going on at the\r\n      back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her back, and a\r\n      short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed back to the\r\n      gate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out after them, and\r\n      all four, looking round at the carriage, ran in dismay up the steps of the\r\n      back porch.\n“Those are Mary’s ‘God’s folk,’” said Prince Andrew. “They have mistaken\r\n      us for my father. This is the one matter in which she disobeys him. He\r\n      orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she receives them.”\n“But what are ‘God’s folk’?” asked Pierre.\nPrince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them,\r\n      and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back\r\n      soon.\nThe old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.\nPrince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept in\r\n      perfect order and readiness for him in his father’s house; he himself went\r\n      to the nursery.\n“Let us go and see my sister,” he said to Pierre when he returned. “I have\r\n      not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her ‘God’s folk.’ It\r\n      will serve her right, she will be confused, but you will see her ‘God’s\r\n      folk.’ It’s really very curious.”\n“What are ‘God’s folk’?” asked Pierre.\n“Come, and you’ll see for yourself.”\nPrincess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face\r\n      when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon\r\n      stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monk’s\r\n      cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an\r\n      armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on her\r\n      childlike face.\n“Andrew, why didn’t you warn me?” said the princess, with mild reproach,\r\n      as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens.\n“Charmée de vous voir. Je suis très contente de vous voir,”* she said to\r\n      Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and now his\r\n      friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above all his\r\n      kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She looked at him\r\n      with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, “I like you very much,\r\n      but please don’t laugh at my people.” After exchanging the first\r\n      greetings, they sat down.\n* “Delighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.”\n“Ah, and Ivánushka is here too!” said Prince Andrew, glancing with a smile\r\n      at the young pilgrim.\n“Andrew!” said Princess Mary, imploringly.“Il faut que vous sachiez que\r\n      c’est une femme,”* said Prince Andrew to Pierre.\n“Andrew,au nom de Dieu!” *(2) Princess Mary repeated.\n* “You must know that this is a woman.”\n* (2) “For heaven’s sake.”\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew’s ironical tone toward the pilgrims and\r\n      Princess Mary’s helpless attempts to protect them were their customary\r\n      long-established relations on the matter.\n“Mais, ma bonne amie,”said Prince Andrew,“vous devriez au contraire\r\n      m’être reconnaissante de ce que j’explique à Pierre votre intimité avec ce\r\n      jeune homme.”*\n* “But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to\r\n     me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young\r\n     man.”\n“Really?” said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and\r\n      seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into\r\n      Ivánushka’s face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked\r\n      round at them all with crafty eyes.\nPrincess Mary’s embarrassment onher people’saccount was quite\r\n      unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering\r\n      her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup\r\n      upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat quietly\r\n      in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea.\r\n      Ivánushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes from\r\n      under her brows at the young men.\n“Where have you been? To Kiev?” Prince Andrew asked the old woman.\n“I have, good sir,” she answered garrulously. “Just at\r\n      Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly\r\n      sacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now I’m from Kolyázin, master,\r\n      where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed.”\n“And was Ivánushka with you?”\n“I go by myself, benefactor,” said Ivánushka, trying to speak in a bass\r\n      voice. “I only came across Pelagéya in Yúkhnovo....”\nPelagéya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what she\r\n      had seen.\n“In Kolyázin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.”\n“What is it? Some new relics?” asked Prince Andrew.\n“Andrew, do leave off,” said Princess Mary. “Don’t tell him, Pelagéya.”\n“No... why not, my dear, why shouldn’t I? I like him. He is kind, he is\r\n      one of God’s chosen, he’s a benefactor, he once gave me ten rubles, I\r\n      remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (he’s one of God’s\r\n      own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says, ‘Why are you not going\r\n      to the right place? Go to Kolyázin where a wonder-working icon of the Holy\r\n      Mother of God has been revealed.’ On hearing those words I said good-by to\r\n      the holy folk and went.”\nAll were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones, drawing\r\n      in her breath.\n“So I come, master, and the people say to me: ‘A great blessing has been\r\n      revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother, the\r\n      Holy Virgin Mother of God.’...”\n“All right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,” said Princess Mary,\r\n      flushing.\n“Let me ask her,” said Pierre. “Did you see it yourselves?” he inquired.\n“Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face like\r\n      the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother’s cheek it drops and\r\n      drops....”\n“But, dear me, that must be a fraud!” said Pierre, naïvely, who had\r\n      listened attentively to the pilgrim.\n“Oh, master, what are you saying?” exclaimed the horrified Pelagéya,\r\n      turning to Princess Mary for support.\n“They impose on the people,” he repeated.\n“Lord Jesus Christ!” exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself. “Oh,\r\n      don’t speak so, master! There was a general who did not believe, and said,\r\n      ‘The monks cheat,’ and as soon as he’d said it he went blind. And he\r\n      dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and\r\n      said, ‘Believe in me and I will make you whole.’ So he begged: ‘Take me to\r\n      her, take me to her.’ It’s the real truth I’m telling you, I saw it\r\n      myself. So he was brought, quite blind, straight to her, and he goes up to\r\n      her and falls down and says, ‘Make me whole,’ says he, ‘and I’ll give thee\r\n      what the Tsar bestowed on me.’ I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed\r\n      into the icon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! It’s a\r\n      sin to speak so. God will punish you,” she said admonishingly, turning to\r\n      Pierre.\n“How did the star get into the icon?” Pierre asked.\n“And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?” said Prince\r\n      Andrew, with a smile.\nPelagéya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.\n“Oh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!” she began, her\r\n      pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. “Master, what have you said? God\r\n      forgive you!” And she crossed herself. “Lord forgive him! My dear, what\r\n      does it mean?...” she asked, turning to Princess Mary. She got up and,\r\n      almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She evidently felt frightened\r\n      and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be\r\n      said, and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of\r\n      this house.\n“Now, why need you do it?” said Princess Mary. “Why did you come to\r\n      me?...”\n“Come, Pelagéya, I was joking,” said Pierre. “Princesse, ma parole, je\r\n      n’ai pas voulu l’offenser.* I did not mean anything, I was only joking,”\r\n       he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense. “It was all my\r\n      fault, and Andrew was only joking.”\n* “Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.”\nPelagéya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre’s face there was such a look of\r\n      sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now\r\n      at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured."

    "text": "The pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a long\r\n      account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his hands\r\n      smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks she knew\r\n      let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking some dried\r\n      bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with the saints. “I’d\r\n      pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to another. I’d sleep a bit\r\n      and then again go and kiss the relics, and there was such peace all\r\n      around, such blessedness, that one don’t want to come out, even into the\r\n      light of heaven again.”\nPierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out\r\n      of the room, and then, leaving “God’s folk” to finish their tea, Princess\r\n      Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.\n“You are very kind,” she said to him.\n“Oh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so well\r\n      and have the greatest respect for them.”\nPrincess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.\n“I have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a\r\n      brother,” she said. “How do you find Andrew?” she added hurriedly, not\r\n      giving him time to reply to her affectionate words. “I am very anxious\r\n      about him. His health was better in the winter, but last spring his wound\r\n      reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure. And I am also\r\n      very much afraid for him spiritually. He has not a character like us women\r\n      who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows. He keeps it all within\r\n      him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits, but that is the effect of\r\n      your visit—he is not often like that. If you could persuade him to\r\n      go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet regular life is very bad for\r\n      him. Others don’t notice it, but I see it.”\nToward ten o’clock the men servants rushed to the front door, hearing the\r\n      bells of the old prince’s carriage approaching. Prince Andrew and Pierre\r\n      also went out into the porch.\n“Who’s that?” asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out of the\r\n      carriage.\n“Ah! Very glad! Kiss me,” he said, having learned who the young stranger\r\n      was.\nThe old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.\nBefore supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his father’s study, found him\r\n      disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time would\r\n      come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it\r\n      chaffingly, but without getting angry.\n“Drain the blood from men’s veins and put in water instead, then there\r\n      will be no more war! Old women’s nonsense—old women’s nonsense!” he\r\n      repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately on the shoulder, and\r\n      then went up to the table where Prince Andrew, evidently not wishing to\r\n      join in the conversation, was looking over the papers his father had\r\n      brought from town. The old prince went up to him and began to talk\r\n      business.\n“The marshal, a Count Rostóv, hasn’t sent half his contingent. He came to\r\n      town and wanted to invite me to dinner—I gave him a pretty\r\n      dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,” the old prince went\r\n      on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. “A fine fellow—your\r\n      friend—I like him! He stirs me up. Another says clever things and\r\n      one doesn’t care to listen, but this one talks rubbish yet stirs an old\r\n      fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps I’ll come and sit with you at\r\n      supper. We’ll have another dispute. Make friends with my little fool,\r\n      Princess Mary,” he shouted after Pierre, through the door.\nOnly now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the\r\n      strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm was\r\n      not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family and\r\n      with the household. With the stern old prince and the gentle, timid\r\n      Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once felt like\r\n      an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess Mary,\r\n      who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her most\r\n      radiant looks, but even the one-year-old “Prince Nicholas” (as his\r\n      grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his\r\n      arms, and Michael Ivánovich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with\r\n      pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.\nThe old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierre’s account.\r\n      And during the two days of the young man’s visit he was extremely kind to\r\n      him and told him to visit them again.\nWhen Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they\r\n      began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new\r\n      acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but\r\n      what was good of him."

    "text": "When returning from his leave, Rostóv felt, for the first time, how close\r\n      was the bond that united him to Denísov and the whole regiment.\nOn approaching it, Rostóv felt as he had done when approaching his home in\r\n      Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his\r\n      regiment, when he recognized red-haired Deméntyev and saw the picket ropes\r\n      of the roan horses, when Lavrúshka gleefully shouted to his master, “The\r\n      count has come!” and Denísov, who had been asleep on his bed, ran all\r\n      disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected\r\n      round to greet the new arrival, Rostóv experienced the same feeling as\r\n      when his mother, his father, and his sister had embraced him, and tears of\r\n      joy choked him so that he could not speak. The regiment was also a home,\r\n      and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents’ house.\nWhen he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had been\r\n      reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone out\r\n      foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests of the\r\n      regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow,\r\n      unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of moral\r\n      support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own place, as he\r\n      had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of all that turmoil of\r\n      the world at large, where he did not know his right place and took\r\n      mistaken decisions; here was no Sónya with whom he ought, or ought not, to\r\n      have an explanation; here was no possibility of going there or not going\r\n      there; here there were not twenty-four hours in the day which could be\r\n      spent in such a variety of ways; there was not that innumerable crowd of\r\n      people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another;\r\n      there were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his\r\n      father, and nothing to recall that terrible loss to Dólokhov. Here, in the\r\n      regiment, all was clear and simple. The whole world was divided into two\r\n      unequal parts: one, our Pávlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And\r\n      the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite:\r\n      who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and\r\n      most of all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one’s\r\n      pay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide, you\r\n      had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the Pávlograd regiment\r\n      and, when given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly, and\r\n      definitely ordered—and all would be well.\nHaving once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental\r\n      life, Rostóv felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to\r\n      rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter\r\n      for him, because, after his loss to Dólokhov (for which, in spite of all\r\n      his family’s efforts to console him, he could not forgive himself), he had\r\n      made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving, not as he had done\r\n      before, but really well, and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and\r\n      officer—in a word, a splendid man altogether, a thing which seemed\r\n      so difficult outin the world, but so possible in the regiment.\nAfter his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in\r\n      five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved to\r\n      take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his\r\n      parents.\nOur army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pultúsk and\r\n      Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the\r\n      Emperor’s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.\nThe Pávlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had\r\n      served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in Russia,\r\n      and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign. It\r\n      had been neither at Pultúsk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and, when it joined\r\n      the army in the field in the second half of the campaign, was attached to\r\n      Plátov’s division.\nPlátov’s division was acting independently of the main army. Several times\r\n      parts of the Pávlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy, had\r\n      taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot’s carriages.\r\n      In April the Pávlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a\r\n      totally ruined and deserted German village.\nA thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke, and\r\n      the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the men nor\r\n      fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could arrive, the\r\n      men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages, searching for\r\n      potatoes, but found few even of these.\nEverything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled—if any\r\n      remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken\r\n      from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking\r\n      anything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.\nThe Pávlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but had\r\n      lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals, death\r\n      was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling that\r\n      came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able to drag\r\n      their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals. When spring\r\n      came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that\r\n      looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called “Máshka’s sweet\r\n      root.” It was very bitter, but they wandered about the fields seeking it\r\n      and dug it out with their sabers and ate it, though they were ordered not\r\n      to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That spring a new disease broke out\r\n      among the soldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs, and face, which the\r\n      doctors attributed to eating this root. But in spite of all this, the\r\n      soldiers of Denísov’s squadron fed chiefly on “Máshka’s sweet root,”\r\n       because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being\r\n      doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received\r\n      had sprouted and frozen.\nThe horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched\r\n      roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of\r\n      felty winter hair.\nDespite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just as\r\n      usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the hussars\r\n      formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their horses,\r\n      polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of\r\n      fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up\r\n      hungry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As usual, in their\r\n      spare time, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before them naked;\r\n      smoked, picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told and listened\r\n      to stories of Potëmkin’s and Suvórov’s campaigns, or to legends of Alësha\r\n      the Sly, or the priest’s laborer Mikólka.\nThe officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,\r\n      half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and,\r\n      in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as\r\n      before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was no\r\n      food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles. The\r\n      general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because nothing\r\n      certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague feeling that\r\n      in the main it was going badly.\nRostóv lived, as before, with Denísov, and since their furlough they had\r\n      become more friendly than ever. Denísov never spoke of Rostóv’s family,\r\n      but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, Rostóv felt that\r\n      the elder hussar’s luckless love for Natásha played a part in\r\n      strengthening their friendship. Denísov evidently tried to expose Rostóv\r\n      to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his safe\r\n      return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in a deserted\r\n      and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions, Rostóv\r\n      found a family consisting of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant\r\n      in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak to get away on foot and had\r\n      no means of obtaining a conveyance. Rostóv brought them to his quarters,\r\n      placed them in his own lodging, and kept them for some weeks while the old\r\n      man was recovering. One of his comrades, talking of women, began chaffing\r\n      Rostóv, saying that he was more wily than any of them and that it would\r\n      not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had\r\n      saved. Rostóv took the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such\r\n      unpleasant things to the officer that it was all Denísov could do to\r\n      prevent a duel. When the officer had gone away, Denísov, who did not\r\n      himself know what Rostóv’s relations with the Polish girl might be, began\r\n      to upbraid him for his quickness of temper, and Rostóv replied:\n“Say what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I can’t tell you\r\n      how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....”\nDenísov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room\r\n      without looking at Rostóv, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.\n“Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostóvs are!” he muttered, and Rostóv noticed\r\n      tears in his eyes."

    "text": "In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor’s arrival, but\r\n      Rostóv had no chance of being present at the review he held at\r\n      Bartenstein, as the Pávlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place.\nThey were bivouacking. Denísov and Rostóv were living in an earth hut, dug\r\n      out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The hut\r\n      was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A trench\r\n      was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep, and eight\r\n      feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and these formed\r\n      the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room, in which the\r\n      lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board, lying on piles at\r\n      the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On each side of the\r\n      trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet,\r\n      and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof was so constructed\r\n      that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up\r\n      on the beds if one drew close to the table. Denísov, who was living\r\n      luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a\r\n      board in the roof at the farther end, with a piece of (broken but mended)\r\n      glass in it for a window. When it was very cold, embers from the soldiers’\r\n      campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the\r\n      “reception room”—as Denísov called that part of the hut—and it\r\n      was then so warm that the officers, of whom there were always some with\r\n      Denísov and Rostóv, sat in their shirt sleeves.\nIn April, Rostóv was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and\r\n      eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed his\r\n      rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm, then\r\n      tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and, his face\r\n      glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt, lay\r\n      down on his back, putting his arms under his head. He was pleasantly\r\n      considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last\r\n      reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting Denísov, who had gone out\r\n      somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.\nSuddenly he heard Denísov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut,\r\n      evidently much excited. Rostóv moved to the window to see whom he was\r\n      speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topchéenko.\n“I ordered you not to let them eat that Máshka woot stuff!” Denísov was\r\n      shouting. “And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchúk bwought some fwom the\r\n      fields.”\n“I have given the order again and again, your honor, but they don’t obey,”\r\n       answered the quartermaster.\nRostóv lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: “Let him fuss\r\n      and bustle now, my job’s done and I’m lying down—capitally!” He\r\n      could hear that Lavrúshka—that sly, bold orderly of Denísov’s—was\r\n      talking, as well as the quartermaster. Lavrúshka was saying something\r\n      about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when he had gone out\r\n      for provisions.\nThen Denísov’s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away. “Saddle!\r\n      Second platoon!”\n“Where are they off to now?” thought Rostóv.\nFive minutes later, Denísov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots on\r\n      the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took his\r\n      leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to\r\n      Rostóv’s inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly that\r\n      he had some business.\n“Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!” said Denísov going\r\n      out, and Rostóv heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the\r\n      mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Denísov had gone. Having\r\n      got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till\r\n      toward evening. Denísov had not yet returned. The weather had cleared up,\r\n      and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playingsváyka,\r\n      laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft\r\n      mud. Rostóv joined them. In the middle of the game, the officers saw some\r\n      wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind\r\n      them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a\r\n      crowd of hussars surrounded them.\n“There now, Denísov has been worrying,” said Rostóv, “and here are the\r\n      provisions.”\n“So they are!” said the officers. “Won’t the soldiers be glad!”\nA little behind the hussars came Denísov, accompanied by two infantry\r\n      officers with whom he was talking.\nRostóv went to meet them.\n“I warn you, Captain,” one of the officers, a short thin man, evidently\r\n      very angry, was saying.\n“Haven’t I told you I won’t give them up?” replied Denísov.\n“You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny—seizing the transport\r\n      of one’s own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.”\n“And mine have had nothing for two weeks,” said Denísov.\n“It is robbery! You’ll answer for it, sir!” said the infantry officer,\r\n      raising his voice.\n“Now, what are you pestewing me for?” cried Denísov, suddenly losing his\r\n      temper. “I shall answer for it and not you, and you’d better not buzz\r\n      about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!” he shouted at the officers.\n“Very well, then!” shouted the little officer, undaunted and not riding\r\n      away. “If you are determined to rob, I’ll...”\n“Go to the devil! quick ma’ch, while you’re safe and sound!” and Denísov\r\n      turned his horse on the officer.\n“Very well, very well!” muttered the officer, threateningly, and turning\r\n      his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.\n“A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!” shouted Denísov after\r\n      him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted\r\n      infantryman) and riding up to Rostóv, he burst out laughing.\n“I’ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!” he said. “After all,\r\n      can’t let our men starve.”\nThe wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry\r\n      regiment, but learning from Lavrúshka that the transport was unescorted,\r\n      Denísov with his hussars had seized it by force. The soldiers had biscuits\r\n      dealt out to them freely, and they even shared them with the other\r\n      squadrons.\nThe next day the regimental commander sent for Denísov, and holding his\r\n      fingers spread out before his eyes said:\n“This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and won’t\r\n      begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle\r\n      the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a\r\n      receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as the demand was\r\n      booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row and the affair\r\n      may end badly.”\nFrom the regimental commander’s, Denísov rode straight to the staff with a\r\n      sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came back to his\r\n      dugout in a state such as Rostóv had never yet seen him in. Denísov could\r\n      not speak and gasped for breath. When Rostóv asked what was the matter, he\r\n      only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse, feeble voice.\nAlarmed at Denísov’s condition, Rostóv suggested that he should undress,\r\n      drink some water, and send for the doctor.\n“Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but I’ll\r\n      always thwash scoundwels... and I’ll tell the Empewo’... Ice...” he\r\n      muttered.\nThe regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary to\r\n      bleed Denísov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm\r\n      and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him.\n“I get there,” began Denísov. “‘Now then, where’s your chief’s quarters?’\r\n      They were pointed out. ‘Please to wait.’ ‘I’ve widden twenty miles and\r\n      have duties to attend to and no time to wait. Announce me.’ Vewy well, so\r\n      out comes their head chief—also took it into his head to lecture me:\r\n      ‘It’s wobbewy!’—‘Wobbewy,’ I say, ‘is not done by man who seizes\r\n      pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his own\r\n      pockets!’ ‘Will you please be silent?’ ‘Vewy good!’ Then he says: ‘Go and\r\n      give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair will be passed on to\r\n      headquarters.’ I go to the commissioner. I enter, and at the table... who\r\n      do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it that’s starving us?”\r\n       shouted Denísov, hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so\r\n      violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped\r\n      about. “Telyánin! ‘What? So it’s you who’s starving us to death! Is it?\r\n      Take this and this!’ and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... ‘Ah,\r\n      what a... what a...!’ and I sta’ted fwashing him... Well, I’ve had a bit\r\n      of fun I can tell you!” cried Denísov, gleeful and yet angry, his white\r\n      teeth showing under his black mustache. “I’d have killed him if they\r\n      hadn’t taken him away!”\n“But what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,” said Rostóv. “You’ve set\r\n      your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again.”\nDenísov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and\r\n      cheerful.\nBut at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostóv’s and Denísov’s\r\n      dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper\r\n      addressed to Major Denísov from the regimental commander in which\r\n      inquiries were made about yesterday’s occurrence. The adjutant told them\r\n      that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a court-martial\r\n      had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with which marauding\r\n      and insubordination were now regarded, degradation to the ranks would be\r\n      the best that could be hoped for.\nThe case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after seizing\r\n      the transports, Major Denísov, being drunk, went to the chief\r\n      quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened\r\n      to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given\r\n      two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.\nIn answer to Rostóv’s renewed questions, Denísov said, laughing, that he\r\n      thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it, but\r\n      that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the least fear any\r\n      kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give\r\n      them an answer that they would not easily forget.\nDenísov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rostóv knew him too\r\n      well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart he feared a\r\n      court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was evidently taking\r\n      a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices from the court\r\n      arrived, and on the first of May, Denísov was ordered to hand the squadron\r\n      over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division\r\n      to explain his violence at the commissariat office. On the previous day\r\n      Plátov reconnoitered with two Cossack regiments and two squadrons of\r\n      hussars. Denísov, as was his wont, rode out in front of the outposts,\r\n      parading his courage. A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in\r\n      the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at another time Denísov would not have\r\n      left the regiment for so slight a wound, but now he took advantage of it\r\n      to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital."

    "text": "In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the Pávlograds did\r\n      not take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. Rostóv, who\r\n      felt his friend’s absence very much, having no news of him since he left\r\n      and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs,\r\n      took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denísov in hospital.\nThe hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated\r\n      by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so\r\n      beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly\r\n      dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets,\r\n      tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.\nThe hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and\r\n      panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence\r\n      that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale\r\n      swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard.\nDirectly Rostóv entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of\r\n      putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army doctor\r\n      smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.\n“I can’t tear myself to pieces,” the doctor was saying. “Come to Makár\r\n      Alexéevich in the evening. I shall be there.”\nThe assistant asked some further questions.\n“Oh, do the best you can! Isn’t it all the same?” The doctor noticed\r\n      Rostóv coming upstairs.\n“What do you want, sir?” said the doctor. “What do you want? The bullets\r\n      having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a pesthouse, sir.”\n“How so?” asked Rostóv.\n“Typhus, sir. It’s death to go in. Only we two, Makéev and I” (he pointed\r\n      to the assistant), “keep on here. Some five of us doctors have died in\r\n      this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,” said the\r\n      doctor with evident satisfaction. “Prussian doctors have been invited\r\n      here, but our allies don’t like it at all.”\nRostóv explained that he wanted to see Major Denísov of the hussars, who\r\n      was wounded.\n“I don’t know. I can’t tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in charge of\r\n      three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! It’s well that the\r\n      charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each\r\n      month or we should be lost!” he laughed. “Four hundred, sir, and they’re\r\n      always sending me fresh ones. Therearefour hundred? Eh?” he asked,\r\n      turning to the assistant.\nThe assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and impatient for\r\n      the talkative doctor to go.\n“Major Denísov,” Rostóv said again. “He was wounded at Molliten.”\n“Dead, I fancy. Eh, Makéev?” queried the doctor, in a tone of\r\n      indifference.\nThe assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor’s words.\n“Is he tall and with reddish hair?” asked the doctor.\nRostóv described Denísov’s appearance.\n“There was one like that,” said the doctor, as if pleased. “That one is\r\n      dead, I fancy. However, I’ll look up our list. We had a list. Have you got\r\n      it, Makéev?”\n“Makár Alexéevich has the list,” answered the assistant. “But if you’ll\r\n      step into the officers’ wards you’ll see for yourself,” he added, turning\r\n      to Rostóv.\n“Ah, you’d better not go, sir,” said the doctor, “or you may have to stay\r\n      here yourself.”\nBut Rostóv bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to\r\n      show him the way.\n“Only don’t blame me!” the doctor shouted up after him.\nRostóv and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell was so\r\n      strong there that Rostóv held his nose and had to pause and collect his\r\n      strength before he could go on. A door opened to the right, and an\r\n      emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, limped\r\n      out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked with glittering envious eyes\r\n      at those who were passing. Glancing in at the door, Rostóv saw that the\r\n      sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats.\n“May I go in and look?”\n“What is there to see?” said the assistant.\nBut, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in,\r\n      Rostóv entered the soldiers’ ward. The foul air, to which he had already\r\n      begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It was a\r\n      little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where it\r\n      originated.\nIn the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows,\r\n      the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and\r\n      leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were unconscious and paid no\r\n      attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious raised themselves or\r\n      lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at Rostóv with the\r\n      same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and envy of another’s\r\n      health. Rostóv went to the middle of the room and looking through the open\r\n      doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there. He stood\r\n      still, looking silently around. He had not at all expected such a sight.\r\n      Just before him, almost across the middle of the passage on the bare\r\n      floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge by the cut of his hair.\r\n      The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs outstretched. His face was\r\n      purple, his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen, and\r\n      on his bare legs and arms which were still red, the veins stood out like\r\n      cords. He was knocking the back of his head against the floor, hoarsely\r\n      uttering some word which he kept repeating. Rostóv listened and made out\r\n      the word. It was “drink, drink, a drink!” Rostóv glanced round, looking\r\n      for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water.\n“Who looks after the sick here?” he asked the assistant.\nJust then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the\r\n      next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of Rostóv.\n“Good day, your honor!” he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rostóv and\r\n      evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.\n“Get him to his place and give him some water,” said Rostóv, pointing to\r\n      the Cossack.\n“Yes, your honor,” the soldier replied complacently, and rolling his eyes\r\n      more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not move.\n“No, it’s impossible to do anything here,” thought Rostóv, lowering his\r\n      eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense look fixed on\r\n      him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on an overcoat, sat\r\n      an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton, with a stern\r\n      sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostóv. The man’s neighbor on one\r\n      side whispered something to him, pointing at Rostóv, who noticed that the\r\n      old man wanted to speak to him. He drew nearer and saw that the old man\r\n      had only one leg bent under him, the other had been amputated above the\r\n      knee. His neighbor on the other side, who lay motionless some distance\r\n      from him with his head thrown back, was a young soldier with a snub nose.\r\n      His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back.\r\n      Rostóv looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back.\n“Why, this one seems...” he began, turning to the assistant.\n“And how we’ve been begging, your honor,” said the old soldier, his jaw\r\n      quivering. “He’s been dead since morning. After all we’re men, not dogs.”\n“I’ll send someone at once. He shall be taken away—taken away at\r\n      once,” said the assistant hurriedly. “Let us go, your honor.”\n“Yes, yes, let us go,” said Rostóv hastily, and lowering his eyes and\r\n      shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful\r\n      envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the room."

    "text": "Going along the corridor, the assistant led Rostóv to the officers’ wards,\r\n      consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood open. There were beds\r\n      in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on\r\n      them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns. The\r\n      first person Rostóv met in the officers’ ward was a thin little man with\r\n      one arm, who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital\r\n      dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth. Rostóv looked at him, trying\r\n      to remember where he had seen him before.\n“See where we’ve met again!” said the little man. “Túshin, Túshin, don’t\r\n      you remember, who gave you a lift at Schön Grabern? And I’ve had a bit cut\r\n      off, you see...” he went on with a smile, pointing to the empty sleeve of\r\n      his dressing gown. “Looking for Vasíli Dmítrich Denísov? My neighbor,” he\r\n      added, when he heard who Rostóv wanted. “Here, here,” and Túshin led him\r\n      into the next room, from whence came sounds of several laughing voices.\n“How can they laugh, or even live at all here?” thought Rostóv, still\r\n      aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the\r\n      soldiers’ ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks\r\n      which had followed him out from both sides, and the face of that young\r\n      soldier with eyes rolled back.\nDenísov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though it\r\n      was nearly noon.\n“Ah, Wostóv? How are you, how are you?” he called out, still in the same\r\n      voice as in the regiment, but Rostóv noticed sadly that under this\r\n      habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed\r\n      itself in the expression of Denísov’s face and the intonations of his\r\n      voice.\nHis wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks\r\n      after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces\r\n      of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck Rostóv.\r\n      What struck him was that Denísov did not seem glad to see him, and smiled\r\n      at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about the\r\n      general state of affairs, and when Rostóv spoke of these matters did not\r\n      listen.\nRostóv even noticed that Denísov did not like to be reminded of the\r\n      regiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on outside\r\n      the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and was only\r\n      interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On Rostóv’s\r\n      inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from under his\r\n      pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of\r\n      his answer to it. He became animated when he began reading his paper and\r\n      specially drew Rostóv’s attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to\r\n      his enemies. His hospital companions, who had gathered round Rostóv—a\r\n      fresh arrival from the world outside—gradually began to disperse as\r\n      soon as Denísov began reading his answer. Rostóv noticed by their faces\r\n      that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and\r\n      were tired of it. Only the man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan,\r\n      continued to sit on his bed, gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and\r\n      little one-armed Túshin still listened, shaking his head disapprovingly.\r\n      In the middle of the reading, the Uhlan interrupted Denísov.\n“But what I say is,” he said, turning to Rostóv, “it would be best simply\r\n      to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards will now be\r\n      distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....”\n“Me petition the Empewo’!” exclaimed Denísov, in a voice to which he tried\r\n      hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like an expression\r\n      of irritable impotence. “What for? If I were a wobber I would ask mercy,\r\n      but I’m being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers to book. Let them twy\r\n      me, I’m not afwaid of anyone. I’ve served the Tsar and my countwy\r\n      honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be degwaded?... Listen, I’m\r\n      w’iting to them stwaight. This is what I say: ‘If I had wobbed the\r\n      Tweasuwy...’”\n“It’s certainly well written,” said Túshin, “but that’s not the point,\r\n      Vasíli Dmítrich,” and he also turned to Rostóv. “One has to submit, and\r\n      Vasíli Dmítrich doesn’t want to. You know the auditor told you it was a\r\n      bad business.”\n“Well, let it be bad,” said Denísov.\n“The auditor wrote out a petition for you,” continued Túshin, “and you\r\n      ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt he”\r\n       (indicating Rostóv) “has connections on the staff. You won’t find a better\r\n      opportunity.”\n“Haven’t I said I’m not going to gwovel?” Denísov interrupted him, went on\r\n      reading his paper.\nRostóv had not the courage to persuade Denísov, though he instinctively\r\n      felt that the way advised by Túshin and the other officers was the safest,\r\n      and though he would have been glad to be of service to Denísov. He knew\r\n      his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper.\nWhen the reading of Denísov’s virulent reply, which took more than an\r\n      hour, was over, Rostóv said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day in a\r\n      most dejected state of mind amid Denísov’s hospital comrades, who had\r\n      gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to their\r\n      stories. Denísov was moodily silent all the evening.\nLate in the evening, when Rostóv was about to leave, he asked Denísov\r\n      whether he had no commission for him.\n“Yes, wait a bit,” said Denísov, glancing round at the officers, and\r\n      taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where he\r\n      had an inkpot, and sat down to write.\n“It seems it’s no use knocking one’s head against a wall!” he said, coming\r\n      from the window and giving Rostóv a large envelope. In it was the petition\r\n      to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in which Denísov, without alluding\r\n      to the offenses of the commissariat officials, simply asked for pardon.\n“Hand it in. It seems...”\nHe did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile."

    "text": "Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of\r\n      Denísov’s affairs, Rostóv rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor.\nOn the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in\r\n      Tilsit. Borís Drubetskóy had asked the important personage on whom he was\r\n      in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at\r\n      Tilsit.\n“I should like to see the great man,” he said, alluding to Napoleon, whom\r\n      hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.\n“You are speaking of Buonaparte?” asked the general, smiling.\nBorís looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was\r\n      being tested.\n“I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,” he replied. The general\r\n      patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.\n“You will go far,” he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.\nBorís was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two Emperors\r\n      met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon pass before\r\n      the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the pensive face\r\n      of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of\r\n      the Niemen awaiting Napoleon’s arrival, saw both Emperors get into boats,\r\n      and saw how Napoleon—reaching the raft first—stepped quickly\r\n      forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him, and how they both\r\n      retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun to move in the highest\r\n      circles Borís had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on\r\n      around him and to note it down. At the time of the meeting at Tilsit he\r\n      asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon and about the uniforms\r\n      they wore, and listened attentively to words spoken by important\r\n      personages. At the moment the Emperors went into the pavilion he looked at\r\n      his watch, and did not forget to look at it again when Alexander came out.\r\n      The interview had lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes. He noted this\r\n      down that same evening, among other facts he felt to be of historic\r\n      importance. As the Emperor’s suite was a very small one, it was a matter\r\n      of great importance, for a man who valued his success in the service, to\r\n      be at Tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two Emperors,\r\n      and having succeeded in this, Borís felt that henceforth his position was\r\n      fully assured. He had not only become known, but people had grown\r\n      accustomed to him and accepted him. Twice he had executed commissions to\r\n      the Emperor himself, so that the latter knew his face, and all those at\r\n      court, far from cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him\r\n      a newcomer, would now have been surprised had he been absent.\nBorís lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilínski. Zhilínski,\r\n      a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately fond of the French,\r\n      and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French officers of the Guard\r\n      and from French headquarters were dining and lunching with him and Borís.\nOn the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilínski arranged a\r\n      supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of\r\n      Napoleon’s, there were also several French officers of the Guard, and a\r\n      page of Napoleon’s, a young lad of an old aristocratic French family. That\r\n      same day, Rostóv, profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in\r\n      civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by Borís\r\n      and Zhilínski.\nRostóv, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far from\r\n      having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the French—who\r\n      from being foes had suddenly become friends—that had taken place at\r\n      headquarters and in Borís. In the army, Bonaparte and the French were\r\n      still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt, and fear. Only\r\n      recently, talking with one of Plátov’s Cossack officers, Rostóv had argued\r\n      that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a\r\n      sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately, happening to meet a wounded\r\n      French colonel on the road, Rostóv had maintained with heat that peace was\r\n      impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte.\r\n      Rostóv was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French\r\n      officers in Borís’ lodging, dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to\r\n      see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank.\r\n      As soon as he noticed a French officer, who thrust his head out of the\r\n      door, that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the\r\n      sight of the enemy suddenly seized him. He stopped at the threshold and\r\n      asked in Russian whether Drubetskóy lived there. Borís, hearing a strange\r\n      voice in the anteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance\r\n      showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing Rostóv.\n“Ah, it’s you? Very glad, very glad to see you,” he said, however, coming\r\n      toward him with a smile. But Rostóv had noticed his first impulse.\n“I’ve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have\r\n      business,” he said coldly.\n“No, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment.Dans un\r\n      moment je suis à vous,” * he said, answering someone who called him.\n* “In a minute I shall be at your disposal.”\n“I see I’m intruding,” Rostóv repeated.\nThe look of annoyance had already disappeared from Borís’ face: having\r\n      evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took both\r\n      Rostóv’s hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking serenely\r\n      and steadily at Rostóv, seemed to be veiled by something, as if screened\r\n      by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to Rostóv.\n“Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!” said Borís, and he\r\n      led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him\r\n      to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but an hussar\r\n      officer, and an old friend of his.\n“Count Zhilínski—le ComteN. N.—le CapitaineS.\r\n      S.,” said he, naming his guests. Rostóv looked frowningly at the Frenchmen,\r\n      bowed reluctantly, and remained silent.\nZhilínski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very willingly\r\n      into his circle and did not speak to Rostóv. Borís did not appear to\r\n      notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same pleasant\r\n      composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met\r\n      Rostóv, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the Frenchmen, with the\r\n      politeness characteristic of his countrymen, addressed the obstinately\r\n      taciturn Rostóv, saying that the latter had probably come to Tilsit to see\r\n      the Emperor.\n“No, I came on business,” replied Rostóv, briefly.\nRostóv had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of\r\n      dissatisfaction on Borís’ face, and as always happens to those in a bad\r\n      humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that\r\n      he was in everybody’s way. He really was in their way, for he alone took\r\n      no part in the conversation which again became general. The looks the\r\n      visitors cast on him seemed to say: “And what is he sitting here for?” He\r\n      rose and went up to Borís.\n“Anyhow, I’m in your way,” he said in a low tone. “Come and talk over my\r\n      business and I’ll go away.”\n“Oh, no, not at all,” said Borís. “But if you are tired, come and lie down\r\n      in my room and have a rest.”\n“Yes, really...”\nThey went into the little room where Borís slept. Rostóv, without sitting\r\n      down, began at once, irritably (as if Borís were to blame in some way)\r\n      telling him about Denísov’s affair, asking him whether, through his\r\n      general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on Denísov’s behalf\r\n      and get Denísov’s petition handed in. When he and Borís were alone, Rostóv\r\n      felt for the first time that he could not look Borís in the face without a\r\n      sense of awkwardness. Borís, with one leg crossed over the other and\r\n      stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right, listened to\r\n      Rostóv as a general listens to the report of a subordinate, now looking\r\n      aside and now gazing straight into Rostóv’s eyes with the same veiled\r\n      look. Each time this happened Rostóv felt uncomfortable and cast down his\r\n      eyes.\n“I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe in\r\n      such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the Emperor,\r\n      but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general, I think...”\n“So you don’t want to do anything? Well then, say so!” Rostóv almost\r\n      shouted, not looking Borís in the face.\nBorís smiled.\n“On the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...”\nAt that moment Zhilínski’s voice was heard calling Borís.\n“Well then, go, go, go...” said Rostóv, and refusing supper and remaining\r\n      alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long time, hearing\r\n      the lighthearted French conversation from the next room."

    "text": "Rostóv had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on\r\n      Denísov’s behalf. He could not himself go to the general in attendance as\r\n      he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so, and\r\n      Borís, even had he wished to, could not have done so on the following day.\r\n      On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were signed. The Emperors\r\n      exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross of the Legion of Honor\r\n      and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the First Degree, and a dinner had\r\n      been arranged for the evening, given by a battalion of the French Guards\r\n      to the Preobrazhénsk battalion. The Emperors were to be present at that\r\n      banquet.\nRostóv felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Borís that, when the\r\n      latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next\r\n      morning went away, avoiding Borís. In his civilian clothes and a round\r\n      hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the French and their uniforms\r\n      and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French Emperors were\r\n      staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for\r\n      the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors draped from side to side\r\n      of the streets, with huge monogramsAandN. In the windows of the\r\n      houses also flags and bunting were displayed.\n“Borís doesn’t want to help me and I don’t want to ask him. That’s\r\n      settled,” thought Nicholas. “All is over between us, but I won’t leave\r\n      here without having done all I can for Denísov and certainly not without\r\n      getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!... He is here!” thought\r\n      Rostóv, who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander\r\n      lodged.\nSaddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were\r\n      assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.\n“I may see him at any moment,” thought Rostóv. “If only I were to hand the\r\n      letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really arrest me for\r\n      my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on whose side justice\r\n      lies. He understands everything, knows everything. Who can be more just,\r\n      more magnanimous than he? And even if they did arrest me for being here,\r\n      what would it matter?” thought he, looking at an officer who was entering\r\n      the house the Emperor occupied. “After all, people do go in.... It’s all\r\n      nonsense! I’ll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the\r\n      worse for Drubetskóy who drives me to it!” And suddenly with a\r\n      determination he himself did not expect, Rostóv felt for the letter in his\r\n      pocket and went straight to the house.\n“No, I won’t miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,” he\r\n      thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of the\r\n      blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. “I will fall at his feet\r\n      and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even thank me.\r\n      ‘I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is the greatest\r\n      happiness,’” Rostóv fancied the sovereign saying. And passing people who\r\n      looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch of the Emperor’s\r\n      house.\nA broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he saw\r\n      a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the lower\r\n      floor.\n“Whom do you want?” someone inquired.\n“To hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,” said Nicholas, with a\r\n      tremor in his voice.\n“A petition? This way, to the officer on duty” (he was shown the door\r\n      leading downstairs), “only it won’t be accepted.”\nOn hearing this indifferent voice, Rostóv grew frightened at what he was\r\n      doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so fascinating\r\n      and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away, but the\r\n      official who had questioned him opened the door, and Rostóv entered.\nA short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and a\r\n      batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that\r\n      room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new\r\n      pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason, attracted\r\n      Rostóv’s attention. This man was speaking to someone in the adjoining\r\n      room.\n“A good figure and in her first bloom,” he was saying, but on seeing\r\n      Rostóv, he stopped short and frowned.\n“What is it? A petition?”\n“What is it?” asked the person in the other room.\n“Another petitioner,” answered the man with the braces.\n“Tell him to come later. He’ll be coming out directly, we must go.”\n“Later... later! Tomorrow. It’s too late...”\nRostóv turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped him.\n“Whom have you come from? Who are you?”\n“I come from Major Denísov,” answered Rostóv.\n“Are you an officer?”\n“Lieutenant Count Rostóv.”\n“What audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with\r\n      you... go,” and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him.\nRostóv went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were\r\n      many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.\nCursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself\r\n      at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to shame and\r\n      arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety of his\r\n      conduct and repenting of it, Rostóv, with downcast eyes, was making his\r\n      way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice\r\n      called him and a hand detained him.\n“What are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?” asked a deep voice.\nIt was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor’s special favor\r\n      during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in which\r\n      Rostóv was serving.\nRostóv, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly,\r\n      jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice\r\n      told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for Denísov, whom the\r\n      general knew. Having heard Rostóv to the end, the general shook his head\r\n      gravely.\n“I’m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.”\nHardly had Rostóv handed him the letter and finished explaining Denísov’s\r\n      case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs,\r\n      and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The gentlemen of the\r\n      Emperor’s suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses. Hayne, the\r\n      same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the Emperor’s horse, and the\r\n      faint creak of a footstep Rostóv knew at once was heard on the stairs.\r\n      Forgetting the danger of being recognized, Rostóv went close to the porch,\r\n      together with some inquisitive civilians, and again, after two years, saw\r\n      those features he adored: that same face and same look and step, and the\r\n      same union of majesty and mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and\r\n      love for his sovereign rose again in Rostóv’s soul in all its old force.\r\n      In the uniform of the Preobrazhénsk regiment—white chamois-leather\r\n      breeches and high boots—and wearing a star Rostóv did not know (it\r\n      was that of theLégion d’honneur), the monarch came out into the porch,\r\n      putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and\r\n      looked about him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a\r\n      few words to some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander\r\n      of Rostóv’s division, smiled and beckoned to him.\nAll the suite drew back and Rostóv saw the general talking for some time\r\n      to the Emperor.\nThe Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse.\r\n      Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom was\r\n      Rostóv) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse, with his\r\n      hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in\r\n      a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:\n“I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than I,”\r\n       and he raised his foot to the stirrup.\nThe general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and rode\r\n      down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm, Rostóv ran\r\n      after him with the crowd."

    "text": "The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion of\r\n      the Preobrazhénsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the\r\n      French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.\nAs the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented arms,\r\n      another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and at the\r\n      head of them Rostóv recognized Napoleon. It could be no one else. He came\r\n      at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over a white vest,\r\n      and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding a very fine\r\n      thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth.\r\n      On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did so, Rostóv, with\r\n      his cavalryman’s eye, could not help noticing that Napoleon did not sit\r\n      well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions shouted “Hurrah!” and“Vive\r\n      l’Empereur!”Napoleon said something to Alexander, and both Emperors\r\n      dismounted and took each other’s hands. Napoleon’s face wore an unpleasant\r\n      and artificial smile. Alexander was saying something affable to him.\nIn spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes’ horses, which were\r\n      pushing back the crowd, Rostóv kept his eyes on every movement of\r\n      Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander\r\n      treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with\r\n      the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter to\r\n      him.\nAlexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached\r\n      the right flank of the Preobrazhénsk battalion and came straight up to the\r\n      crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the\r\n      Emperors that Rostóv, standing in the front row, was afraid he might be\r\n      recognized.\n“Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the bravest\r\n      of your soldiers,” said a sharp, precise voice, articulating every letter.\nThis was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into\r\n      Alexander’s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him\r\n      and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.\n“To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,” added\r\n      Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance\r\n      exasperating to Rostóv, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn up\r\n      before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their Emperor.\n“Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?” said Alexander and\r\n      took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlóvski, the commander of the\r\n      battalion.\nBonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand, tore\r\n      it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him rushed\r\n      forward and picked it up.\n“To whom shall it be given?” the Emperor Alexander asked Kozlóvski, in\r\n      Russian in a low voice.\n“To whomever Your Majesty commands.”\nThe Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,\r\n      remarked:\n“But we must give him an answer.”\nKozlóvski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostóv in his\r\n      scrutiny.\n“Can it be me?” thought Rostóv.\n“Lázarev!” the colonel called, with a frown, and Lázarev, the first\r\n      soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.\n“Where are you off to? Stop here!” voices whispered to Lázarev who did not\r\n      know where to go. Lázarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at his colonel\r\n      in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers called before\r\n      the ranks.\nNapoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out\r\n      behind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing at\r\n      once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed something\r\n      from one to another, and a page—the same one Rostóv had seen the\r\n      previous evening at Borís’—ran forward and, bowing respectfully over\r\n      the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment, laid in it an\r\n      Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking, pressed two fingers\r\n      together and the badge was between them. Then he approached Lázarev (who\r\n      rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch), looked round\r\n      at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for\r\n      the sake of his ally, and the small white hand holding the Order touched\r\n      one of Lázarev’s buttons. It was as if Napoleon knew that it was only\r\n      necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldier’s breast for the\r\n      soldier to be forever happy, rewarded, and distinguished from everyone\r\n      else in the world. Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lázarev’s breast and,\r\n      dropping his hand, turned toward Alexander as though sure that the cross\r\n      would adhere there. And it really did.\nOfficious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and\r\n      fastened it to the uniform. Lázarev glanced morosely at the little man\r\n      with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing\r\n      motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexander’s eyes,\r\n      as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do something\r\n      else. But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in that rigid\r\n      position.\nThe Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazhénsk battalion,\r\n      breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables\r\n      prepared for them.\nLázarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced\r\n      him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and\r\n      civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French\r\n      voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square. Two\r\n      officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by Rostóv.\n“What d’you think of the treat? All on silver plate,” one of them was\r\n      saying. “Have you seen Lázarev?”\n“I have.”\n“Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhénskis will give them a dinner.”\n“Yes, but what luck for Lázarev! Twelve hundred francs’ pension for life.”\n“Here’s a cap, lads!” shouted a Preobrazhénsk soldier, donning a shaggy\r\n      French cap.\n“It’s a fine thing! First-rate!”\n“Have you heard the password?” asked one Guards’ officer of another. “The\r\n      day before yesterday it was‘Napoléon, France, bravoure’; yesterday,‘Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.’One day our Emperor gives it and next day\r\n      Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St. George’s Cross to the\r\n      bravest of the French Guards. It has to be done. He must respond in kind.”\nBorís, too, with his friend Zhilínski, came to see the Preobrazhénsk\r\n      banquet. On his way back, he noticed Rostóv standing by the corner of a\r\n      house.\n“Rostóv! How d’you do? We missed one another,” he said, and could not\r\n      refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and troubled\r\n      was Rostóv’s face.\n“Nothing, nothing,” replied Rostóv.\n“You’ll call round?”\n“Yes, I will.”\nRostóv stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a\r\n      distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could not\r\n      bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he remembered\r\n      Denísov with his changed expression, his submission, and the whole\r\n      hospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So vividly\r\n      did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to\r\n      see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that self-satisfied\r\n      Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an Emperor, liked and\r\n      respected by Alexander. Then why those severed arms and legs and those\r\n      dead men?... Then again he thought of Lázarev rewarded and Denísov\r\n      punished and unpardoned. He caught himself harboring such strange thoughts\r\n      that he was frightened.\nThe smell of the food the Preobrazhénskis were eating and a sense of\r\n      hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to eat\r\n      before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning. There\r\n      he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself, had come\r\n      in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a dinner. Two\r\n      officers of his own division joined him. The conversation naturally turned\r\n      on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of the army, were\r\n      dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland. They\r\n      said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would have been done\r\n      for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition. Nicholas ate and\r\n      drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a couple of bottles of\r\n      wine by himself. The process in his mind went on tormenting him without\r\n      reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to his thoughts, yet could\r\n      not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the officers’ saying that it was\r\n      humiliating to look at the French, Rostóv began shouting with uncalled-for\r\n      wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the officers:\n“How can you judge what’s best?” he cried, the blood suddenly rushing to\r\n      his face. “How can you judge the Emperor’s actions? What right have we to\r\n      argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor’s aims or his actions!”\n“But I never said a word about the Emperor!” said the officer, justifying\r\n      himself, and unable to understand Rostóv’s outburst, except on the\r\n      supposition that he was drunk.\nBut Rostóv did not listen to him.\n“We are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,” he\r\n      went on. “If we are ordered to die, we must die. If we’re punished, it\r\n      means that we have deserved it, it’s not for us to judge. If the Emperor\r\n      pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with\r\n      him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin judging\r\n      and arguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That way we\r\n      shall be saying there is no God—nothing!” shouted Nicholas, banging\r\n      the table—very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners,\r\n      but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts.\n“Our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That’s\r\n      all....” said he.\n“And to drink,” said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.\n“Yes, and to drink,” assented Nicholas. “Hullo there! Another bottle!” he\r\n      shouted.\nIn 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with\r\n      the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was\r\n      much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting."

On other estates the serfs’ compulsory labor was\r\n      commuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for Boguchárovo at\r\n      his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the\r\n      children of the peasants and household serfs.\nPrince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his\r\n      son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he spent in\r\n      “Boguchárovo Cloister,” as his father called Prince Andrew’s estate.\r\n      Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to\r\n      Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received many books, and\r\n      to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from\r\n      Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged behind himself—who\r\n      never left the country—in knowledge of what was happening in home\r\n      and foreign affairs.\nBesides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of\r\n      books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our\r\n      last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a\r\n      reform of the army rules and regulations.\nIn the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryazán estates which had been\r\n      inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.\nWarmed by the spring sunshine he sat in thecalèchelooking at the new\r\n      grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white\r\n      spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. He was not thinking of\r\n      anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side.\nThey crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before.\r\n      They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green\r\n      fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge,\r\n      uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of\r\n      stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a\r\n      birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the forest it was\r\n      almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with their sticky green\r\n      leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades of\r\n      green grass were pushing up and lifting last year’s leaves. The coarse\r\n      evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the\r\n      birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter. On entering the forest the\r\n      horses began to snort and sweated visibly.\nPeter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented.\r\n      But apparently the coachman’s sympathy was not enough for Peter, and he\r\n      turned on the box toward his master.\n“How pleasant it is, your excellency!” he said with a respectful smile.\n“What?”\n“It’s pleasant, your excellency!”\n“What is he talking about?” thought Prince Andrew. “Oh, the spring,\r\n      I suppose,” he thought as he turned round. “Yes, really everything is\r\n      green already.... How early! The birches and cherry and alders too are\r\n      coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is one oak!”\nAt the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of\r\n      the birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice\r\n      as tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a\r\n      man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been\r\n      broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling\r\n      unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged,\r\n      stern, and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the\r\n      dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak, refused\r\n      to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine.\n“Spring, love, happiness!” this oak seemed to say. “Are you not weary of\r\n      that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the same and\r\n      always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look at those\r\n      cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out my broken\r\n      and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my back or my\r\n      sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in your hopes\r\n      and your lies.”\nAs he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to look\r\n      at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak, too, were\r\n      flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid, misshapen, and\r\n      grim as ever.\n“Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,” thought Prince Andrew.\r\n      “Let others—the young—yield afresh to that fraud, but we know\r\n      life, our life is finished!”\nA whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose\r\n      in his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as it\r\n      were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion,\r\n      restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything\r\n      anew—but that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and\r\n      not disturbing himself or desiring anything."

    "text": "Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district in\r\n      connection with the affairs of the Ryazán estate of which he was trustee.\r\n      This Marshal was Count Ilyá Rostóv, and in the middle of May Prince Andrew\r\n      went to visit him.\nIt was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already clothed in\r\n      green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to\r\n      bathe.\nPrince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he\r\n      had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds of\r\n      the Rostóvs’ house at Otrádnoe. He heard merry girlish cries behind some\r\n      trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross the path of\r\n      hiscalèche. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark-haired,\r\n      remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with a white\r\n      handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped. The\r\n      girl was shouting something but, seeing that he was a stranger, ran back\r\n      laughing without looking at him.\nSuddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so beautiful,\r\n      the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim pretty girl did\r\n      not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was contented and cheerful\r\n      in her own separate—probably foolish—but bright and happy\r\n      life. “What is she so glad about? What is she thinking of? Not of the\r\n      military regulations or of the arrangement of the Ryazán serfs’ quitrents.\r\n      Of what is she thinking? Why is she so happy?” Prince Andrew asked himself\r\n      with instinctive curiosity.\nIn 1809 Count Ilyá Rostóv was living at Otrádnoe just as he had done in\r\n      former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with hunts,\r\n      theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince Andrew, as he\r\n      was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying the night.\nDuring the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by his\r\n      elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old count’s\r\n      house was crowded on account of an approaching name day), Prince Andrew\r\n      repeatedly glanced at Natásha, gay and laughing among the younger members\r\n      of the company, and asked himself each time, “What is she thinking about?\r\n      Why is she so glad?”\nThat night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He\r\n      read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the\r\n      room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the\r\n      stupid old man (as he called Rostóv), who had made him stay by assuring\r\n      him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he\r\n      was vexed with himself for having stayed.\nHe got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the\r\n      shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst\r\n      into the room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and\r\n      very still. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking\r\n      black on one side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the trees\r\n      grew some kind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and\r\n      stems here and there. Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered\r\n      with dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and\r\n      branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its full, in a pale,\r\n      almost starless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the window\r\n      ledge and his eyes rested on that sky.\nHis room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were also awake.\r\n      He heard female voices overhead.\n“Just once more,” said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew\r\n      recognized at once.\n“But when are you coming to bed?” replied another voice.\n“I won’t, I can’t sleep, what’s the use? Come now for the last time.”\nTwo girlish voices sang a musical passage—the end of some song.\n“Oh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there’s an end of it.”\n“You go to sleep, but I can’t,” said the first voice, coming nearer to the\r\n      window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the rustle of her dress\r\n      and even her breathing could be heard. Everything was stone-still, like\r\n      the moon and its light and the shadows. Prince Andrew, too, dared not\r\n      stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional presence.\n“Sónya! Sónya!” he again heard the first speaker. “Oh, how can you sleep?\r\n      Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up, Sónya!” she\r\n      said almost with tears in her voice. “There never, never was such a lovely\r\n      night before!”\nSónya made some reluctant reply.\n“Do just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come here....\r\n      Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like sitting down\r\n      on my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this, straining tight, as\r\n      tight as possible, and flying away! Like this....”\n“Take care, you’ll fall out.”\nHe heard the sound of a scuffle and Sónya’s disapproving voice: “It’s past\r\n      one o’clock.”\n“Oh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!”\nAgain all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting there.\r\n      From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.\n“O God, O God! What does it mean?” she suddenly exclaimed. “To bed then,\r\n      if it must be!” and she slammed the casement.\n“For her I might as well not exist!” thought Prince Andrew while he\r\n      listened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that she\r\n      might say something about him. “There she is again! As if it were on\r\n      purpose,” thought he.\nIn his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful\r\n      thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his life, that unable\r\n      to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once."

    "text": "Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not waiting\r\n      for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.\nIt was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove\r\n      into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and\r\n      memorable an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded\r\n      yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was\r\n      thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest did\r\n      not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood around,\r\n      were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.\nThe whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only a\r\n      small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road and\r\n      the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade, the\r\n      right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by\r\n      the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales trilled, and their\r\n      voices reverberated now near, now far away.\n“Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,” thought\r\n      Prince Andrew. “But where is it?” he again wondered, gazing at the left\r\n      side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at\r\n      the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured, spreading out a\r\n      canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and slightly trembling in\r\n      the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old\r\n      doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now. Through the hard\r\n      century-old bark, even where there were no twigs, leaves had sprouted such\r\n      as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced.\n“Yes, it is the same oak,” thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he was\r\n      seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal. All the\r\n      best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz with the\r\n      lofty heavens, his wife’s dead reproachful face, Pierre at the ferry, that\r\n      girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night itself and the\r\n      moon, and... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.\n“No, life is not over at thirty-one!” Prince Andrew suddenly decided\r\n      finally and decisively. “It is not enough for me to know what I have in me—everyone\r\n      must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the\r\n      sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be lived for myself\r\n      alone while others live so apart from it, but so that it may be reflected\r\n      in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!”\n\nOn reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn and\r\n      found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series of sensible\r\n      and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to\r\n      Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing up in his\r\n      mind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the\r\n      necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month before he had\r\n      not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter\r\n      his head. It now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must\r\n      be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again\r\n      played an active part in life. He did not even remember how formerly, on\r\n      the strength of similar wretched logical arguments, it had seemed obvious\r\n      that he would be degrading himself if he now, after the lessons he had had\r\n      in life, allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and\r\n      in the possibility of happiness or love. Now reason suggested quite the\r\n      opposite. After that journey to Ryazán he found the country dull; his\r\n      former pursuits no longer interested him, and often when sitting alone in\r\n      his study he got up, went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own\r\n      face. Then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with\r\n      hair curledà la grecquelooked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt\r\n      frame. She did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked\r\n      simply, merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his\r\n      arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as he\r\n      reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a crime,\r\n      which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with fame,\r\n      with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman’s beauty and love. And if\r\n      anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold, stern,\r\n      and above all unpleasantly logical.\n“My dear,” Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say, “little\r\n      Nicholas can’t go out today, it’s very cold.”\n“If it were hot,” Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly to\r\n      his sister, “he could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he must wear\r\n      warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That is what follows\r\n      from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child who needs fresh air\r\n      should remain at home,” he would add with extreme logic, as if punishing\r\n      someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him.\nAt such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries men\r\n      up."

    "text": "Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time when\r\n      the youthful Speránski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were\r\n      being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That same August the\r\n      Emperor was thrown from hiscalèche, injured his leg, and remained three\r\n      weeks at Peterhof, receiving Speránski every day and no one else. At that\r\n      time the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society—abolishing\r\n      court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of\r\n      Collegiate Assessor and State Councilor—and not merely these but a\r\n      whole state constitution, intended to change the existing order of\r\n      government in Russia: legal, administrative, and financial, from the\r\n      Council of State down to the district tribunals. Now those vague liberal\r\n      dreams with which the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which\r\n      he had tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates,\r\n      Czartorýski, Novosíltsev, Kochubéy, and Strógonov—whom he himself in\r\n      jest had called hisComité de salut public—were taking shape and\r\n      being realized.\nNow all these men were replaced by Speránski on the civil side, and\r\n      Arakchéev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a\r\n      gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a levee. The\r\n      Emperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with a single word. It\r\n      had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic to the\r\n      Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally,\r\n      and in the cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he now found\r\n      further confirmation of this surmise. The courtiers explained the\r\n      Emperor’s neglect of him by His Majesty’s displeasure at Bolkónski’s not\r\n      having served since 1805.\n“I know myself that one cannot help one’s sympathies and antipathies,”\r\n       thought Prince Andrew, “so it will not do to present my proposal for the\r\n      reform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally, but the project\r\n      will speak for itself.”\nHe mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend of his\r\n      father’s. The field marshal made an appointment to see him, received him\r\n      graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few days later Prince\r\n      Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of War, Count\r\n      Arakchéev.\n\nOn the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakchéev’s waiting room\r\n      at nine in the morning.\nHe did not know Arakchéev personally, had never seen him, and all he had\r\n      heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.\n“He is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not\r\n      concern myself about his personal qualities: he has been commissioned to\r\n      consider my project, so he alone can get it adopted,” thought Prince\r\n      Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in\r\n      Count Arakchéev’s waiting room.\nDuring his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the\r\n      anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms\r\n      were well known to him. Count Arakchéev’s anteroom had quite a special\r\n      character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an\r\n      audience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of those of higher\r\n      rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness, covered by a mask of\r\n      unconcern and ridicule of themselves, their situation, and the person for\r\n      whom they were waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and down, others\r\n      whispered and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname “Síla Andréevich”\r\n       and the words, “Unclewill give it to us hot,” in reference to Count\r\n      Arakchéev. One general (an important personage), evidently feeling\r\n      offended at having to wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing his legs\r\n      and smiling contemptuously to himself.\nBut the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces—that\r\n      of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to\r\n      take in his name, but received an ironical look and was told that his turn\r\n      would come in due course. After some others had been shown in and out of\r\n      the minister’s room by the adjutant on duty, an officer who struck Prince\r\n      Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible\r\n      door. This officer’s audience lasted a long time. Then suddenly the\r\n      grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door,\r\n      and the officer—with pale face and trembling lips—came out and\r\n      passed through the waiting room, clutching his head.\nAfter this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on duty\r\n      said in a whisper, “To the right, at the window.”\nPrince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of\r\n      forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles,\r\n      scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red nose.\r\n      Arakchéev turned his head toward him without looking at him.\n“What is your petition?” asked Arakchéev.\n“I am not petitioning, your excellency,” returned Prince Andrew quietly.\nArakchéev’s eyes turned toward him.\n“Sit down,” said he. “Prince Bolkónski?”\n“I am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has deigned\r\n      to send your excellency a project submitted by me...”\n“You see, my dear sir, I have read your project,” interrupted Arakchéev,\r\n      uttering only the first words amiably and then—again without looking\r\n      at Prince Andrew—relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling\r\n      contempt. “You are proposing new military laws? There are many laws but no\r\n      one to carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody designs laws, it is\r\n      easier writing than doing.”\n“I came at His Majesty the Emperor’s wish to learn from your excellency\r\n      how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have presented,” said Prince\r\n      Andrew politely.\n“I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the\r\n      committee. I do not approve of it,” said Arakchéev, rising and taking a\r\n      paper from his writing table. “Here!” and he handed it to Prince Andrew.\nAcross the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters,\r\n      misspelled, and without punctuation: “Unsoundly constructed because\r\n      resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles\r\n      of War needlessly deviating.”\n“To what committee has the memorandum been referred?” inquired Prince\r\n      Andrew.\n“To the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that your\r\n      honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.”\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n“I don’t want one.”\n“A member without salary,” repeated Arakchéev. “I have the honor... Eh!\r\n      Call the next one! Who else is there?” he shouted, bowing to Prince\r\n      Andrew."

    "text": "While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee\r\n      Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly those he\r\n      knew to be in power and whose aid he might need. In Petersburg he now\r\n      experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when\r\n      troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling\r\n      circles where the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was\r\n      being shaped. From the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the\r\n      uninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation of\r\n      everyone, and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose\r\n      existence he learned every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in\r\n      Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation, the commander in\r\n      chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know, but who was\r\n      supposed to be a man of genius—Speránski. And this movement of\r\n      reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and Speránski its\r\n      chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question of the\r\n      army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his\r\n      consciousness.\nPrince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the\r\n      highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming\r\n      party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because he\r\n      was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by\r\n      liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal.\r\n      The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations,\r\n      turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms,\r\n      simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine society world\r\n      welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a good match, and\r\n      almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death\r\n      and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this the general opinion of all\r\n      who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these\r\n      last five years, having softened and grown more manly, lost his former\r\n      affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony, and acquired the serenity that\r\n      comes with years. People talked about him, were interested in him, and\r\n      wanted to meet him.\nThe day after his interview with Count Arakchéev, Prince Andrew spent the\r\n      evening at Count Kochubéy’s. He told the count of his interview withSíla\r\n      Andréevich(Kochubéy spoke of Arakchéev by that nickname with the same\r\n      vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of War’s anteroom).\n“Mon cher, even in this case you can’t do without Michael Mikháylovich\r\n      Speránski. He manages everything. I’ll speak to him. He has promised to\r\n      come this evening.”\n“What has Speránski to do with the army regulations?” asked Prince Andrew.\nKochubéy shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at Bolkónski’s\r\n      simplicity.\n“We were talking to him about you a few days ago,” Kochubéy continued,\r\n      “and about your freed plowmen.”\n“Oh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?” said an old man of\r\n      Catherine’s day, turning contemptuously toward Bolkónski.\n“It was a small estate that brought in no profit,” replied Prince Andrew,\r\n      trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man\r\n      uselessly.\n“Afraid of being late...” said the old man, looking at Kochubéy.\n“There’s one thing I don’t understand,” he continued. “Who will plow the\r\n      land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but difficult to\r\n      rule.... Just the same as now—I ask you, Count—who will be\r\n      heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?”\n“Those who pass the examinations, I suppose,” replied Kochubéy, crossing\r\n      his legs and glancing round.\n“Well, I have Pryánichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a priceless\r\n      man, but he’s sixty. Is he to go up for examination?”\n“Yes, that’s a difficulty, as education is not at all general, but...”\nCount Kochubéy did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the arm, and\r\n      went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open\r\n      forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was just\r\n      entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a cross\r\n      suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It was Speránski.\r\n      Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a throb within him, as\r\n      happens at critical moments of life. Whether it was from respect, envy, or\r\n      anticipation, he did not know. Speránski’s whole figure was of a peculiar\r\n      type that made him easily recognizable. In the society in which Prince\r\n      Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy\r\n      gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance; he had never seen so\r\n      resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half-closed, rather\r\n      humid eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed nothing; nor had he heard\r\n      such a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all he had never seen such\r\n      delicate whiteness of face or hands—hands which were broad, but very\r\n      plump, soft, and white. Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only\r\n      seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital. This was\r\n      Speránski, Secretary of State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion\r\n      at Erfurt, where he had more than once met and talked with Napoleon.\nSperánski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people\r\n      involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to speak.\r\n      He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and he\r\n      looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.\nPrince Andrew followed Speránski’s every word and movement with particular\r\n      attention. As happens to some people, especially to men who judge those\r\n      near to them severely, he always on meeting anyone new—especially\r\n      anyone whom, like Speránski, he knew by reputation—expected to\r\n      discover in him the perfection of human qualities.\nSperánski told Kochubéy he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner as\r\n      he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the Emperor had\r\n      kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty. When\r\n      Kochubéy introduced Prince Andrew, Speránski slowly turned his eyes to\r\n      Bolkónski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence.\n“I am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as everyone\r\n      has,” he said after a pause.\nKochubéy said a few words about the reception Arakchéev had given\r\n      Bolkónski. Speránski smiled more markedly.\n“The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend\r\n      Monsieur Magnítski,” he said, fully articulating every word and syllable,\r\n      “and if you like I can put you in touch with him.” He paused at the full\r\n      stop. “I hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co-operate in\r\n      promoting all that is reasonable.”\nA circle soon formed round Speránski, and the old man who had talked about\r\n      his subordinate Pryánichnikov addressed a question to him.\nPrince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement\r\n      of Speránski’s: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity\r\n      student, who now, Bolkónski thought, held in his hands—those plump\r\n      white hands—the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the\r\n      extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speránski answered the old\r\n      man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from an\r\n      immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud, Speránski\r\n      smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of\r\n      what pleased the sovereign.\nHaving talked for a little while in the general circle, Speránski rose and\r\n      coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room. It\r\n      was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in Bolkónski.\n“I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated\r\n      conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,” he said with\r\n      a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he and\r\n      Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had\r\n      just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. “I have known of you for\r\n      a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs, a first\r\n      example, of which it is very desirable that there should be more\r\n      imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the\r\n      chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree\r\n      concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much\r\n      gossip and tittle-tattle.”\n“No,” said Prince Andrew, “my father did not wish me to take advantage of\r\n      the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.”\n“Your father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above our\r\n      contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re-establishes\r\n      natural justice.”\n“I think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,” returned\r\n      Prince Andrew, trying to resist Speránski’s influence, of which he began\r\n      to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in everything and felt\r\n      a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke easily and well, he felt a\r\n      difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with Speránski. He was\r\n      too much absorbed in observing the famous man’s personality.\n“Grounds of personal ambition maybe,” Speránski put in quietly.\n“And of state interest to some extent,” said Prince Andrew.\n“What do you mean?” asked Speránski quietly, lowering his eyes.\n“I am an admirer of Montesquieu,” replied Prince Andrew, “and his idea\r\n      thatle principe des monarchies est l’honneur me paraît incontestable.\r\n      Certains droits et privilèges de la noblesse me paraissent être des moyens\r\n      de soutenir ce sentiment.” *\n* “The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me\r\n     incontestable. Certain rights and privileges for the\r\n     aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that\r\n     sentiment.”\nThe smile vanished from Speránski’s white face, which was much improved by\r\n      the change. Probably Prince Andrew’s thought interested him.\n“Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,”* he began,\r\n      pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower than\r\n      in Russian but quite calmly.\n* “If you regard the question from that point of view.”\nSperánski went on to say that honor,l’honneur, cannot be upheld by\r\n      privileges harmful to the service; that honor,l’honneur, is either a\r\n      negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of\r\n      emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it. His\r\n      arguments were concise, simple, and clear.\n“An institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one similar\r\n      to theLégion d’honneurof the great Emperor Napoleon, not harmful but\r\n      helpful to the success of the service, but not a class or court\r\n      privilege.”\n“I do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges have\r\n      attained the same end,” returned Prince Andrew. “Every courtier considers\r\n      himself bound to maintain his position worthily.”\n“Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,” said\r\n      Speránski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an\r\n      argument which was embarrassing for his companion. “If you will do me the\r\n      honor of calling on me on Wednesday,” he added, “I will, after talking\r\n      with Magnítski, let you know what may interest you, and shall also have\r\n      the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you.”\nClosing his eyes, he bowedà la française, without taking leave, and\r\n      trying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER VI",
    "text": "During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the\r\n      whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite\r\n      overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.\nOn returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four or\r\n      five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The mechanism of\r\n      life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere, absorbed\r\n      the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing, did not even think\r\n      or find time to think, but only talked, and talked successfully, of what\r\n      he had thought while in the country.\nHe sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark\r\n      on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy for whole days\r\n      together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing.\nAs he had done on their first meeting at Kochubéy’s, Speránski produced a\r\n      strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he received him\r\n      tête-à-tête at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially.\nTo Bolkónski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant\r\n      creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that\r\n      perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in\r\n      Speránski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous\r\n      man. Had Speránski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the\r\n      same breeding and traditions, Bolkónski would soon have discovered his\r\n      weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, Speránski’s strange and\r\n      logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did\r\n      not quite understand him. Moreover, Speránski, either because he\r\n      appreciated the other’s capacity or because he considered it necessary to\r\n      win him to his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness\r\n      before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which\r\n      goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption\r\n      that one’s companion is the only man besides oneself capable of\r\n      understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and\r\n      profundity of one’s own ideas.\nDuring their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speránski more than\r\n      once remarked: “We regard everything that is above the common level of\r\n      rooted custom...” or, with a smile: “Butwewant the wolves to\r\n      be fed and the sheep to be safe...” or: “Theycannot understand\r\n      this...” and all in a way that seemed to say: “We, you and I,\r\n      understand whattheyare and whoweare.”\nThis first long conversation with Speránski only strengthened in Prince\r\n      Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting.\r\n      He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by\r\n      his energy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely\r\n      for the welfare of Russia. In Prince Andrew’s eyes Speránski was the man\r\n      he would himself have wished to be—one who explained all the facts\r\n      of life reasonably, considered important only what was rational, and was\r\n      capable of applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything\r\n      seemed so simple and clear in Speránski’s exposition that Prince Andrew\r\n      involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and argued,\r\n      it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit\r\n      to Speránski’s opinions entirely. Everything was right and everything was\r\n      as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince Andrew. This was\r\n      Speránski’s cold, mirrorlike look, which did not allow one to penetrate to\r\n      his soul, and his delicate white hands, which Prince Andrew involuntarily\r\n      watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power. This\r\n      mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated Prince Andrew, he knew\r\n      not why. He was unpleasantly struck, too, by the excessive contempt for\r\n      others that he observed in Speránski, and by the diversity of lines of\r\n      argument he used to support his opinions. He made use of every kind of\r\n      mental device, except analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince\r\n      Andrew, from one to another. Now he would take up the position of a\r\n      practical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and laugh\r\n      ironically at his opponents; now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise\r\n      to the realm of metaphysics. (This last resource was one he very\r\n      frequently employed.) He would transfer a question to metaphysical\r\n      heights, pass on to definitions of space, time, and thought, and, having\r\n      deduced the refutation he needed, would again descend to the level of the\r\n      original discussion.\nIn general the trait of Speránski’s mentality which struck Prince Andrew\r\n      most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority of\r\n      reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur to him which to\r\n      Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is after all impossible\r\n      to express all one thinks; and that he had never felt the doubt, “Is not\r\n      all I think and believe nonsense?” And it was just this peculiarity of\r\n      Speránski’s mind that particularly attracted Prince Andrew.\nDuring the first period of their acquaintance Bolkónski felt a passionate\r\n      admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for Bonaparte.\r\n      The fact that Speránski was the son of a village priest, and that stupid\r\n      people might meanly despise him on account of his humble origin (as in\r\n      fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to cherish his sentiment for him the\r\n      more, and unconsciously to strengthen it.\nOn that first evening Bolkónski spent with him, having mentioned the\r\n      Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Speránski told him\r\n      sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty\r\n      years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf had\r\n      stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes.\n“And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,” said he.\r\n      “We want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have no laws.\r\n      That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in these\r\n      times!”\nPrince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was\r\n      needed which he did not possess.\n“But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious circle\r\n      from which we must break a way out.”\nA week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army\r\n      Regulations and—what he had not at all expected—was chairman\r\n      of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At Speránski’s\r\n      request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up\r\n      and, with the aid of theCode Napoléonand the Institutes of Justinian, he\r\n      worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights."

    "text": "Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg\r\n      after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading\r\n      position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral\r\n      lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various\r\n      lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection of\r\n      temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms, in\r\n      regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular. He\r\n      supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in\r\n      Petersburg.\nHis life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and\r\n      dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered it\r\n      immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor\r\n      circles in which he moved.\nAmid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at\r\n      the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon\r\n      it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him. At the\r\n      same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer\r\n      bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had joined the\r\n      Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps\r\n      onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it sank in. To\r\n      make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put his other foot down\r\n      and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and involuntarily waded\r\n      knee-deep in the bog.\nJoseph Alexéevich was not in Petersburg—he had of late stood aside\r\n      from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost entirely in\r\n      Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary\r\n      life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in\r\n      Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Iván Vasílevich D., whom he knew in\r\n      society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under the Masonic aprons and\r\n      insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in\r\n      ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up twenty to\r\n      thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen members,\r\n      of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre remembered the\r\n      Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote all his belongings to\r\n      his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul.\nHe divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first he put\r\n      those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in\r\n      human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of\r\n      the order: with questions of the threefold designation of God, the three\r\n      primordial elements—sulphur, mercury, and salt—or the meaning\r\n      of the square and all the various figures of the temple of Solomon. Pierre\r\n      respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged,\r\n      including, Pierre thought, Joseph Alexéevich himself, but he did not share\r\n      their interests. His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry.\nIn the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him,\r\n      seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight\r\n      and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.\nIn the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw\r\n      nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized\r\n      the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their\r\n      purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master of\r\n      the principal lodge.\nFinally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,\r\n      particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre’s\r\n      observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for\r\n      anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy\r\n      young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank, and\r\n      of whom there were very many in the lodge.\nPierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry, at\r\n      any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely on\r\n      externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but suspected\r\n      that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original\r\n      principles. And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be\r\n      initiated into the higher secrets of the order.\nIn the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our Freemasons knew\r\n      from correspondence with those abroad that Bezúkhov had obtained the\r\n      confidence of many highly placed persons, had been initiated into many\r\n      mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was bringing back with\r\n      him much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause in\r\n      Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him, tried to ingratiate\r\n      themselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he was preparing\r\n      something for them and concealing it.\nA solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at which\r\n      Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what he had to\r\n      deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order. The meeting was a\r\n      full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began his address.\n“Dear Brothers,” he began, blushing and stammering, with a written speech\r\n      in his hand, “it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in the\r\n      seclusion of our lodge—we must act—act! We are drowsing, but\r\n      we must act.” Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.\n“For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of virtue,”\r\n       he read, “we must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse principles in\r\n      harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the education of the\r\n      young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men, boldly\r\n      yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and folly, and form of\r\n      those devoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and\r\n      possessed of authority and power.\n“To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and\r\n      must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world,\r\n      receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we\r\n      are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What is to be\r\n      done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow everything,\r\n      repel force by force?... No! We are very far from that. Every violent\r\n      reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy evil while men\r\n      remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no violence.\n“The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing men\r\n      of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction—aiming\r\n      at the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing talent and virtue:\r\n      raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our Brotherhood.\r\n      Only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of\r\n      the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being aware\r\n      of it. In a word, we must found a form of government holding universal\r\n      sway, which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the\r\n      bonds of citizenship, and beside which all other governments can continue\r\n      in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great\r\n      aim of our order, which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice.\r\n      This aim was that of Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and\r\n      good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of\r\n      the best and wisest men.\n“At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching alone\r\n      was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her with special\r\n      strength, but now we need much more powerful methods. It is now necessary\r\n      that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue a charm palpable\r\n      to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the passions; but we must\r\n      strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is therefore necessary that\r\n      everyone should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of\r\n      virtue. Our order should provide means to that end.\n“As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state, each of\r\n      them again training two others and all being closely united, everything\r\n      will be possible for our order, which has already in secret accomplished\r\n      much for the welfare of mankind.”\nThis speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in\r\n      the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs of\r\n      Illuminism, * met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand\r\n      Master began answering him, and Pierre began developing his views with\r\n      more and more warmth. It was long since there had been so stormy a\r\n      meeting. Parties were formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others\r\n      supporting him. At that meeting he was struck for the first time by the\r\n      endless variety of men’s minds, which prevents a truth from ever\r\n      presenting itself identically to two persons. Even those members who\r\n      seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations\r\n      and alterations he could not agree to, as what he always wanted most was\r\n      to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it.\n* The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for\r\n     monarchical institutions.\nAt the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will\r\n      reproved Bezúkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue\r\n      alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute. Pierre\r\n      did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would be\r\n      accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the usual\r\n      formalities he left the lodge and went home."

    "text": "Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For three days\r\n      after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home\r\n      receiving no one and going nowhere.\nIt was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored him\r\n      to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished\r\n      to devote her whole life to him.\nAt the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would\r\n      return to Petersburg from abroad.\nFollowing this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected\r\n      less than the others forced his way in to see him and, turning the\r\n      conversation upon Pierre’s matrimonial affairs, by way of fraternal advice\r\n      expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and that he\r\n      was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not forgiving the\r\n      penitent.\nAt the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vasíli’s wife, sent to him\r\n      imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most\r\n      important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and\r\n      that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then\r\n      was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing\r\n      in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the influence of the\r\n      depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his\r\n      resolution to punish his wife.\n“No one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame,” he\r\n      thought.\nIf he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it was\r\n      only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any\r\n      step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away.\r\n      Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference\r\n      whether he lived with his wife or not?\nWithout replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late one\r\n      night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph\r\n      Alexéevich. This is what he noted in his diary:\nMoscow, 17th November\nI have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I\r\n      have experienced. Joseph Alexéevich is living poorly and has for three\r\n      years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has\r\n      ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till\r\n      late at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working at\r\n      science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on\r\n      which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of Jerusalem,\r\n      and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild smile what I\r\n      had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges. I told him\r\n      everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed to our\r\n      Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of my\r\n      rupture with the Brothers. Joseph Alexéevich, having remained silent and\r\n      thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which at once\r\n      lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow. He\r\n      surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the\r\n      order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The purification\r\n      and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The improvement of\r\n      the human race by striving for such purification. Which is the principalaimof these three? Certainly self-reformation and self-purification. Only\r\n      to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances. But at\r\n      the same time just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us; and so,\r\n      led astray by pride, losing sight of this aim, we occupy ourselves either\r\n      with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek\r\n      the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of\r\n      baseness and profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because\r\n      it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground\r\n      Joseph Alexéevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the\r\n      depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said\r\n      to me, “the chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in\r\n      perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties\r\n      of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary, my\r\n      dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain our\r\n      three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge—for man can only know himself\r\n      by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by\r\n      conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue—love of death.\r\n      Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our\r\n      innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.” These words are all the\r\n      more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings, Joseph\r\n      Alexéevich is never weary of life though he loves death, for which—in\r\n      spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man—he does not yet\r\n      feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained to me\r\n      fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out to me\r\n      that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He advised\r\n      me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but to take up\r\n      only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while diverting the Brothers\r\n      from pride, to turn them toward the true path self-knowledge and\r\n      self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for myself personally above\r\n      all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end he gave me a notebook,\r\n      the one I am now writing in and in which I will in future note down all my\r\n      actions.\nPetersburg, 23rd November\nI am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears and\r\n      said that Hélène was here and that she implored me to hear her; that she\r\n      was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew that if I\r\n      once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing what\r\n      she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice to seek.\r\n      Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do. I went to my\r\n      room and reread Joseph Alexéevich’s letters and recalled my conversations\r\n      with him, and deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a supplicant,\r\n      and ought to reach a helping hand to everyone—especially to one so\r\n      closely bound to me—and that I must bear my cross. But if I forgive\r\n      her for the sake of doing right, then let union with her have only a\r\n      spiritual aim. That is what I decided, and what I wrote to Joseph\r\n      Alexéevich. I told my wife that I begged her to forget the past, to\r\n      forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her, and that I had nothing to\r\n      forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She need not know how hard it\r\n      was for me to see her again. I have settled on the upper floor of this big\r\n      house and am experiencing a happy feeling of regeneration."

    "text": "At that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at court and\r\n      at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each with its own\r\n      particular tone. The largest of these was the French circle of the\r\n      Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count Rumyántsev and Caulaincourt. In\r\n      this group Hélène, as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with her\r\n      husband, took a very prominent place. She was visited by the members of\r\n      the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for\r\n      their intellect and polished manners.\nHélène had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors and\r\n      had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic notabilities.\r\n      At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself had noticed her\r\n      in the theater and said of her:“C’est un superbe animal.”*\r\n      Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise Pierre, for she had\r\n      become even handsomer than before. What did surprise him was that during\r\n      these last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation“d’\r\n      une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle que belle.”*(2) The distinguished\r\n      Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters. Bilíbin saved up his\r\n      epigrams to produce them in Countess Bezúkhova’s presence. To be received\r\n      in the Countess Bezúkhova’s salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect.\r\n      Young men read books before attending Hélène’s evenings, to have something\r\n      to say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors,\r\n      confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a way Hélène was a power.\r\n      Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes attended, with a strange\r\n      feeling of perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner parties, where\r\n      politics, poetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these parties his\r\n      feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be\r\n      found out at any moment. But whether because stupidity was just what was\r\n      needed to run such a salon, or because those who were deceived found\r\n      pleasure in the deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and Hélène\r\n      Bezúkhova’s reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly\r\n      established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and\r\n      everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a\r\n      profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception.\n* “That’s a superb animal.”\n* (2) “Of a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely.”\nPierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He was\r\n      that absent-minded crank, agrand seigneurhusband who was in no one’s\r\n      way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the\r\n      drawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an\r\n      advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during the\r\n      last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract\r\n      interests and his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his\r\n      wife’s circle, which did not interest him, that air of unconcern,\r\n      indifference, and benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired\r\n      artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered his\r\n      wife’s drawing room as one enters a theater, was acquainted with\r\n      everybody, equally pleased to see everyone, and equally indifferent to\r\n      them all. Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him and,\r\n      regardless of whether any “gentlemen of the embassy” were present or not,\r\n      lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not at all in accord\r\n      with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general opinion concerning\r\n      the queer husband of “the most distinguished woman in Petersburg” was so\r\n      well established that no one took his freaks seriously.\nAmong the many young men who frequented her house every day, Borís\r\n      Drubetskóy, who had already achieved great success in the service, was the\r\n      most intimate friend of the Bezúkhov household since Hélène’s return from\r\n      Erfurt. Hélène spoke of him as“mon page”and treated him like a child.\r\n      Her smile for him was the same as for everybody, but sometimes that smile\r\n      made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Borís behaved with a particularly\r\n      dignified and sad deference. This shade of deference also disturbed\r\n      Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three years before from the\r\n      mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now protected\r\n      himself from the danger of its repetition, first by not being a husband to\r\n      his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect.\n“No, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced her\r\n      former infatuations,” he told himself. “There has never been an instance\r\n      of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the heart”—a\r\n      statement which, though gathered from an unknown source, he believed\r\n      implicitly. Yet strange to say Borís’ presence in his wife’s drawing room\r\n      (and he was almost always there) had a physical effect upon Pierre; it\r\n      constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his\r\n      movements.\n“What a strange antipathy,” thought Pierre, “yet I used to like him very\r\n      much.”\nIn the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind\r\n      and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did nothing\r\n      but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow. But a complex\r\n      and difficult process of internal development was taking place all this\r\n      time in Pierre’s soul, revealing much to him and causing him many\r\n      spiritual doubts and joys."

    "text": "Pierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during that\r\n      time:\n\n24th November\nGot up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. (By Joseph\r\n      Alexéevich’s advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and served\r\n      on one of the committees.) Returned home for dinner and dined alone—the\r\n      countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and drank moderately and\r\n      after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers. In the evening I\r\n      went down to the countess and told a funny story about B., and only\r\n      remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly\r\n      at it.\nI am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me to\r\n      walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation, (2)\r\n      to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw from\r\n      worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family\r\n      duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.\n\n27th November\nI got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God, help\r\n      and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures, but\r\n      without proper feeling. Brother Urúsov came and we talked about worldly\r\n      vanities. He told me of the Emperor’s new projects. I began to criticize\r\n      them, but remembered my rules and my benefactor’s words—that a true\r\n      Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid is\r\n      required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist. My tongue is\r\n      my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O. visited me and we had a preliminary talk\r\n      about the reception of a new Brother. They laid on me the duty of Rhetor.\r\n      I feel myself weak and unworthy. Then our talk turned to the\r\n      interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the Temple, the seven\r\n      sciences, the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the\r\n      Holy Spirit. Brother O. was very eloquent. In the evening the admission\r\n      took place. The new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the\r\n      magnificence of the spectacle. It was Borís Drubetskóy who was admitted. I\r\n      nominated him and was the Rhetor. A strange feeling agitated me all the\r\n      time I was alone with him in the dark chamber. I caught myself harboring a\r\n      feeling of hatred toward him which I vainly tried to overcome. That is why\r\n      I should really like to save him from evil and lead him into the path of\r\n      truth, but evil thoughts of him did not leave me. It seemed to me that his\r\n      object in entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor\r\n      with members of our lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me\r\n      several times whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to\r\n      which I could not reply) and that according to my observation he is\r\n      incapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and\r\n      satisfied with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I had no\r\n      cause to doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all the time I\r\n      stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was\r\n      smiling contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to stab his bare\r\n      breast with the sword I held to it. I could not be eloquent, nor could I\r\n      frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to the Grand Master. Great\r\n      Architect of Nature, help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth of\r\n      lies!\n\nAfter this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then\r\n      the following was written:\n\nI have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who advised\r\n      me to hold fast by Brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was revealed to\r\n      me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim is the name of\r\n      the ruler of all. The third name is the name unutterable which means theAll. Talks with Brother V. strengthen, refresh, and support me in the path\r\n      of virtue. In his presence doubt has no place. The distinction between the\r\n      poor teachings of mundane science and our sacred all-embracing teaching is\r\n      clear to me. Human sciences dissect everything to comprehend it, and kill\r\n      everything to examine it. In the holy science of our order all is one, all\r\n      is known in its entirety and life. The Trinity—the three elements of\r\n      matter—are sulphur, mercury, and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and\r\n      fiery nature; in combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a\r\n      desire in the latter by means of which it attracts mercury, seizes it,\r\n      holds it, and in combination produces other bodies. Mercury is a fluid,\r\n      volatile, spiritual essence. Christ, the Holy Spirit, Him!...\n\n3rd December\nAwoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went and\r\n      paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my\r\n      imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when Dólokhov,\r\n      meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying perfect\r\n      peace of mind in spite of my wife’s absence. At the time I gave him no\r\n      answer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave\r\n      him the most malevolent and bitter replies. I recollected myself and drove\r\n      away that thought only when I found myself glowing with anger, but I did\r\n      not sufficiently repent. Afterwards Borís Drubetskóy came and began\r\n      relating various adventures. His coming vexed me from the first, and I\r\n      said something disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared up and said much\r\n      that was unpleasant and even rude to him. He became silent, and I\r\n      recollected myself only when it was too late. My God, I cannot get on with\r\n      him at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set myself above him and so\r\n      become much worse than he, for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on the\r\n      contrary nourish contempt for him. O God, grant that in his presence I may\r\n      rather see my own vileness, and behave so that he too may benefit. After\r\n      dinner I fell asleep and as I was drowsing off I clearly heard a voice\r\n      saying in my left ear, “Thy day!”\nI dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by\r\n      dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left\r\n      thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with my\r\n      hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began\r\n      biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the bigger and\r\n      heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led me\r\n      to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank. I\r\n      stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a fence\r\n      which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I dragged\r\n      myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on the other.\r\n      I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and pointing me to\r\n      a broad avenue and garden, and in the garden was a large and beautiful\r\n      building. I woke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature, help me to tear\r\n      from myself these dogs—my passions especially the last, which unites\r\n      in itself the strength of all the former ones, and aid me to enter that\r\n      temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream.\n\n7th December\nI dreamed that Joseph Alexéevich was sitting in my house, and that I was\r\n      very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered\r\n      incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not\r\n      please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But as soon\r\n      as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young, and he was\r\n      quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order, but so\r\n      softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left the room\r\n      and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on the floor. He\r\n      was telling me something, and I wished to show him my sensibility, and not\r\n      listening to what he was saying I began picturing to myself the condition\r\n      of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying me. And tears came into\r\n      my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he looked at me with vexation\r\n      and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I felt abashed and asked whether\r\n      what he had been saying did not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me\r\n      a kind look, and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where\r\n      there is a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it and I burned with\r\n      longing to caress him and lie down too. And he said, “Tell me frankly what\r\n      is your chief temptation? Do you know it? I think you know it already.”\r\n       Abashed by this question, I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He\r\n      shook his head incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I\r\n      was living with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her\r\n      husband. To this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one’s\r\n      embraces and gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied\r\n      that I should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I\r\n      awoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel: “The life was the\r\n      light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness\r\n      comprehended it not.” Joseph Alexéevich’s face had looked young and\r\n      bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote\r\n      about “conjugal duties.”\n\n9th December\nI had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw that I was\r\n      in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and Joseph Alexéevich came\r\n      in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at once that the process of\r\n      regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed to meet him. I\r\n      embraced him and kissed his hands, and he said, “Hast thou noticed that my\r\n      face is different?” I looked at him, still holding him in my arms, and saw\r\n      that his face was young, but that he had no hair on his head and his\r\n      features were quite changed. And I said, “I should have known you had I\r\n      met you by chance,” and I thought to myself, “Am I telling the truth?” And\r\n      suddenly I saw him lying like a dead body; then he gradually recovered and\r\n      went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of drawing\r\n      paper; I said, “I drew that,” and he answered by bowing his head. I opened\r\n      the book, and on all the pages there were excellent drawings. And in my\r\n      dream I knew that these drawings represented the love adventures of the\r\n      soul with its beloved. And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation\r\n      of a maiden in transparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up\r\n      to the clouds. And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than\r\n      a representation of the Song of Songs. And looking at those drawings I\r\n      dreamed I felt that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away from\r\n      them. Lord, help me! My God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy will be\r\n      done; but if I am myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I shall\r\n      perish of my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!"

    "text": "The Rostóvs’ monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they\r\n      had spent in the country.\nThough Nicholas Rostóv had kept firmly to his resolution and was still\r\n      serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little,\r\n      the way of life at Otrádnoe—Mítenka’s management of affairs, in\r\n      particular—was such that the debts inevitably increased every year.\r\n      The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to\r\n      apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one\r\n      and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last\r\n      time.\nSoon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Véra and was\r\n      accepted.\nThough in Moscow the Rostóvs belonged to the best society without\r\n      themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of\r\n      acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were\r\n      provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without\r\n      inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.\nThe Rostóvs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow,\r\n      and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country neighbors from\r\n      Otrádnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Perónskaya a maid\r\n      of honor, Pierre Bezúkhov, and the son of their district postmaster who\r\n      had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the men who very soon became\r\n      frequent visitors at the Rostóvs’ house in Petersburg were Borís, Pierre\r\n      whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him, and Berg\r\n      who spent whole days at the Rostóvs’ and paid the eldest daughter,\r\n      Countess Véra, the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose.\nNot in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at Austerlitz\r\n      and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He narrated that\r\n      episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone\r\n      believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had obtained two\r\n      decorations for Austerlitz.\nIn the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked\r\n      up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near\r\n      the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had\r\n      done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and so\r\n      insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this,\r\n      and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also. In 1809 he was a\r\n      captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special lucrative posts\r\n      in Petersburg.\nThough some skeptics smiled when told of Berg’s merits, it could not be\r\n      denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent terms\r\n      with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career before\r\n      him and an assured position in society.\nFour years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow\r\n      theater, Berg had pointed out Véra Rostóva to him and had said in German,“das soll mein Weib werden,”* and from that moment had made up his mind\r\n      to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the Rostóvs’ position\r\n      and his own, he decided that the time had come to propose.\n* “That girl shall be my wife.”\nBerg’s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not\r\n      flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure\r\n      Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rostóva; but\r\n      Berg’s chief characteristic was such a naïve and good natured egotism that\r\n      the Rostóvs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing, since he\r\n      himself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed excellent.\r\n      Moreover, the Rostóvs’ affairs were seriously embarrassed, as the suitor\r\n      could not but know; and above all, Véra was twenty-four, had been taken\r\n      out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking and sensible, no\r\n      one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave their consent.\n“You see,” said Berg to his comrade, whom he called “friend” only because\r\n      he knew that everyone has friends, “you see, I have considered it all, and\r\n      should not marry if I had not thought it all out or if it were in any way\r\n      unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and mamma are now provided for—I\r\n      have arranged that rent for them in the Baltic Provinces—and I can\r\n      live in Petersburg on my pay, and with her fortune and my good management\r\n      we can get along nicely. I am not marrying for money—I consider that\r\n      dishonorable—but a wife should bring her share and a husband his. I\r\n      have my position in the service, she has connections and some means. In\r\n      our times that is worth something, isn’t it? But above all, she is a\r\n      handsome, estimable girl, and she loves me....”\nBerg blushed and smiled.\n“And I love her, because her character is sensible and very good. Now the\r\n      other sister, though they are the same family, is quite different—an\r\n      unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence. She is so... you\r\n      know?... Unpleasant... But my fiancée!... Well, you will be coming,” he\r\n      was going to say, “to dine,” but changed his mind and said “to take tea\r\n      with us,” and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of\r\n      tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying his dream of happiness.\nAfter the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg’s\r\n      proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took\r\n      possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere. In\r\n      the family’s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and\r\n      constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved Véra\r\n      sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands. The old\r\n      count felt this most. He would probably have been unable to state the\r\n      cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his affairs.\r\n      He did not know at all how much he had, what his debts amounted to, or\r\n      what dowry he could give Véra. When his daughters were born he had\r\n      assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three hundred\r\n      serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold, and the other was\r\n      mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be\r\n      sold, so that it was impossible to give it to Véra. Nor had he any money.\nBerg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained before the\r\n      wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of\r\n      the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the count thought\r\n      of giving her the Ryazán estate or of selling a forest, at another time of\r\n      borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before the wedding Berg\r\n      entered the count’s study early one morning and, with a pleasant smile,\r\n      respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let him know what Véra’s\r\n      dowry would be. The count was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen\r\n      inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came into\r\n      his head. “I like your being businesslike about it.... I like it. You\r\n      shall be satisfied....”\nAnd patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the\r\n      conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not\r\n      know for certain how much Véra would have and did not receive at least\r\n      part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.\n“Because, consider, Count—if I allowed myself to marry now without\r\n      having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting badly....”\nThe conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to\r\n      avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand for\r\n      eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the\r\n      shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible\r\n      for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready\r\n      money. “Or at least twenty thousand, Count,” he added, “and then a note of\r\n      hand for only sixty thousand.”\n“Yes, yes, all right!” said the count hurriedly. “Only excuse me, my dear\r\n      fellow, I’ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty\r\n      thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me.”"

    "text": "Natásha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which she\r\n      had counted on her fingers with Borís after they had kissed four years\r\n      ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before Sónya and her mother, if\r\n      Borís happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of that episode as\r\n      of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not worth mentioning. But\r\n      in the secret depths of her soul the question whether her engagement to\r\n      Borís was a jest or an important, binding promise tormented her.\nSince Borís left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the\r\n      Rostóvs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed near\r\n      Otrádnoe, but had never been to see them.\nSometimes it occurred to Natásha that he did not wish to see her, and this\r\n      conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him.\n“Nowadays old friends are not remembered,” the countess would say when\r\n      Borís was mentioned.\nAnna Mikháylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed to\r\n      hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously and\r\n      gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he\r\n      had entered. When the Rostóvs came to Petersburg Borís called on them.\nHe drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Natásha was his\r\n      most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of letting\r\n      her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and\r\n      Natásha could not be binding either on her or on him. He had a brilliant\r\n      position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bezúkhova, a\r\n      brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important\r\n      personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he was beginning to\r\n      make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in Petersburg, plans\r\n      which might very easily be realized. When he entered the Rostóvs’ drawing\r\n      room Natásha was in her own room. When she heard of his arrival she almost\r\n      ran into the drawing room, flushed and beaming with a more than cordial\r\n      smile.\nBorís remembered Natásha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining from\r\n      under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had known her\r\n      four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a different\r\n      Natásha entered, and his face expressed rapturous astonishment. This\r\n      expression on his face pleased Natásha.\n“Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?” asked the countess.\nBorís kissed Natásha’s hand and said that he was astonished at the change\r\n      in her.\n“How handsome you have grown!”\n“I should think so!” replied Natásha’s laughing eyes.\n“And is Papa older?” she asked.\nNatásha sat down and, without joining in Borís’ conversation with the\r\n      countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood’s suitor. He felt\r\n      the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her\r\n      occasionally.\nBorís’ uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were allcomme il fautand in the latest fashion. This Natásha noticed at once. He\r\n      sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess, arranging with\r\n      his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand like a\r\n      skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his lips\r\n      about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society, recalling with\r\n      mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. It was not\r\n      accidentally, Natásha felt, that he alluded, when speaking of the highest\r\n      aristocracy, to an ambassador’s ball he had attended, and to invitations\r\n      he had received from N.N. and S.S.\nAll this time Natásha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her brows.\r\n      This gaze disturbed and confused Borís more and more. He looked round more\r\n      frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying. He did not\r\n      stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The same\r\n      inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked at him.\r\n      After his first visit Borís said to himself that Natásha attracted him\r\n      just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that feeling, because\r\n      to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would mean ruin to his\r\n      career, while to renew their former relations without intending to marry\r\n      her would be dishonorable. Borís made up his mind to avoid meeting\r\n      Natásha, but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and\r\n      began calling often and spending whole days at the Rostóvs’. It seemed to\r\n      him that he ought to have an explanation with Natásha and tell her that\r\n      the old times must be forgotten, that in spite of everything... she could\r\n      not be his wife, that he had no means, and they would never let her marry\r\n      him. But he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an\r\n      explanation. From day to day he became more and more entangled. It seemed\r\n      to her mother and Sónya that Natásha was in love with Borís as of old. She\r\n      sang him his favorite songs, showed him her album, making him write in it,\r\n      did not allow him to allude to the past, letting it be understood how\r\n      delightful was the present; and every day he went away in a fog, without\r\n      having said what he meant to, and not knowing what he was doing or why he\r\n      came, or how it would all end. He left off visiting Hélène and received\r\n      reproachful notes from her every day, and yet he continued to spend whole\r\n      days with the Rostóvs."

    "text": "One night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket, without\r\n      her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing under her\r\n      white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and bowing to the\r\n      ground in prayer, her door creaked and Natásha, also in a dressing jacket\r\n      with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in curlpapers, ran in. The\r\n      countess—her prayerful mood dispelled—looked round and\r\n      frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: “Can it be that this couch\r\n      will be my grave?” Natásha, flushed and eager, seeing her mother in\r\n      prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down, and unconsciously put\r\n      out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing that her mother was still\r\n      praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and, rapidly slipping one little foot\r\n      against the other, pushed off her slippers and jumped onto the bed the\r\n      countess had feared might become her grave. This couch was high, with a\r\n      feather bed and five pillows each smaller than the one below. Natásha\r\n      jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled over to the wall, and\r\n      began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled down, raising her knees\r\n      to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly, now covering\r\n      herself up head and all, and now peeping at her mother. The countess\r\n      finished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face, but seeing\r\n      that Natásha’s head was covered, she smiled in her kind, weak way.\n“Now then, now then!” said she.\n“Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes?” said Natásha. “Now, just one on your\r\n      throat and another... that’ll do!” And seizing her mother round the neck,\r\n      she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her mother Natásha seemed\r\n      rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that however she clasped her\r\n      mother she always managed to do it without hurting her or making her feel\r\n      uncomfortable or displeased.\n“Well, what is it tonight?” said the mother, having arranged her pillows\r\n      and waited until Natásha, after turning over a couple of times, had\r\n      settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her arms, and assumed\r\n      a serious expression.\nThese visits of Natásha’s at night before the count returned from his club\r\n      were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and daughter.\n“What is it tonight?—But I have to tell you...”\nNatásha put her hand on her mother’s mouth.\n“About Borís... I know,” she said seriously; “that’s what I have come\r\n      about. Don’t say it—I know. No, do tell me!” and she removed her\r\n      hand. “Tell me, Mamma! He’s nice?”\n“Natásha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say Borís is\r\n      nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what then?... What\r\n      are you thinking about? You have quite turned his head, I can see\r\n      that....”\nAs she said this the countess looked round at her daughter. Natásha was\r\n      lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes\r\n      carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess only saw her\r\n      daughter’s face in profile. That face struck her by its peculiarly serious\r\n      and concentrated expression.\nNatásha was listening and considering.\n“Well, what then?” said she.\n“You have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You\r\n      know you can’t marry him.”\n“Why not?” said Natásha, without changing her position.\n“Because he is young, because he is poor, because he is a relation... and\r\n      because you yourself don’t love him.”\n“How do you know?”\n“I know. It is not right, darling!”\n“But if I want to...” said Natásha.\n“Leave off talking nonsense,” said the countess.\n“But if I want to...”\n“Natásha, I am in earnest...”\nNatásha did not let her finish. She drew the countess’ large hand to her,\r\n      kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned it over and\r\n      began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between the knuckles, then\r\n      the next knuckle, whispering, “January, February, March, April, May.\r\n      Speak, Mamma, why don’t you say anything? Speak!” said she, turning to her\r\n      mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation\r\n      seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say.\n“It won’t do, my love! Not everyone will understand this friendship dating\r\n      from your childish days, and to see him so intimate with you may injure\r\n      you in the eyes of other young men who visit us, and above all it torments\r\n      him for nothing. He may already have found a suitable and wealthy match,\r\n      and now he’s half crazy.”\n“Crazy?” repeated Natásha.\n“I’ll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin...”\n“I know! Cyril Matvéich... but he is old.”\n“He was not always old. But this is what I’ll do, Natásha, I’ll have a\r\n      talk with Borís. He need not come so often....”\n“Why not, if he likes to?”\n“Because I know it will end in nothing....”\n“How can you know? No, Mamma, don’t speak to him! What nonsense!” said\r\n      Natásha in the tone of one being deprived of her property. “Well, I won’t\r\n      marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it.” Natásha smiled\r\n      and looked at her mother. “Not to marry, but just so,” she added.\n“Howso, my pet?”\n“Justso. There’s no need for me to marry him. But...\r\n      justso.”\n“Just so, just so,” repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she went\r\n      off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.\n“Don’t laugh, stop!” cried Natásha. “You’re shaking the whole bed! You’re\r\n      awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait...” and she seized the\r\n      countess’ hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger, saying, “June,”\r\n       and continued, kissing, “July, August,” on the other hand. “But, Mamma, is\r\n      he very much in love? What do you think? Was anybody ever so much in love\r\n      with you? And he’s very nice, very, very nice. Only not quite my taste—he\r\n      is so narrow, like the dining-room clock.... Don’t you understand? Narrow,\r\n      you know—gray, light gray...”\n“What rubbish you’re talking!” said the countess.\nNatásha continued: “Don’t you really understand? Nicholas would\r\n      understand.... Bezúkhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is\r\n      square.”\n“You flirt with him too,” said the countess, laughing.\n“No, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue and\r\n      red.... How can I explain it to you?”\n“Little countess!” the count’s voice called from behind the door. “You’re\r\n      not asleep?” Natásha jumped up, snatched up her slippers, and ran barefoot\r\n      to her own room.\nIt was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no one\r\n      could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.\n“Sónya?” she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little kitten\r\n      with her enormous plait of hair. “No, how could she? She’s virtuous. She\r\n      fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know anything more. Even\r\n      Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how clever I am and how...\r\n      charming she is,” she went on, speaking of herself in the third person,\r\n      and imagining it was some very wise man—the wisest and best of men—who\r\n      was saying it of her. “There is everything, everything in her,” continued\r\n      this man. “She is unusually intelligent, charming... and then sheispretty, uncommonly pretty, and agile—she swims and rides\r\n      splendidly... and her voice! One can really say it’s a wonderful voice!”\nShe hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw herself on\r\n      her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall\r\n      asleep, called Dunyásha the maid to put out the candle, and before\r\n      Dunyásha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier\r\n      world of dreams, where everything was as light and beautiful as in\r\n      reality, and even more so because it was different.\nNext day the countess called Borís aside and had a talk with him, after\r\n      which he ceased coming to the Rostóvs’."

    "text": "On the thirty-first of December, New Year’s Eve, 1809 - 10 an old grandee\r\n      of Catherine’s day was giving a ball and midnight supper. The diplomatic\r\n      corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.\nThe grandee’s well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with\r\n      innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance\r\n      which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but dozens of\r\n      police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch.\r\n      Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried\r\n      footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the carriages emerged men wearing\r\n      uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine cautiously\r\n      descended the carriage steps which were let down for them with a clatter,\r\n      and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance.\nAlmost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the crowd\r\n      and caps were doffed.\n“The Emperor?... No, a minister... prince... ambassador. Don’t you see\r\n      the plumes?...” was whispered among the crowd.\nOne person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone and\r\n      mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.\nA third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rostóvs, who were to\r\n      be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.\nThere had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the\r\n      Rostóv family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive, that the\r\n      dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be arranged as it\r\n      should be.\nMárya Ignátevna Perónskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at the court\r\n      of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the countess and\r\n      piloted the provincial Rostóvs in Petersburg high society, was to\r\n      accompany them to the ball.\nThey were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten\r\n      o’clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were not\r\n      yet dressed.\nNatásha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight that\r\n      morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day. All\r\n      her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they all—she\r\n      herself, Mamma, and Sónya—should be as well dressed as possible.\r\n      Sónya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands. The countess\r\n      was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two girls white gauze\r\n      over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and their hair dressedà\r\n      la grecque.\nEverything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and ears\r\n      washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork silk\r\n      stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the\r\n      hairdressing was almost done. Sónya was finishing dressing and so was the\r\n      countess, but Natásha, who had bustled about helping them all, was\r\n      behindhand. She was still sitting before a looking-glass with a dressing\r\n      jacket thrown over her slender shoulders. Sónya stood ready dressed in the\r\n      middle of the room and, pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty\r\n      finger, was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went through\r\n      it.\n“That’s not the way, that’s not the way, Sónya!” cried Natásha turning her\r\n      head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who was\r\n      dressing it had not time to release. “That bow is not right. Come here!”\nSónya sat down and Natásha pinned the ribbon on differently.\n“Allow me, Miss! I can’t do it like that,” said the maid who was holding\r\n      Natásha’s hair.\n“Oh, dear! Well then, wait. That’s right, Sónya.”\n“Aren’t you ready? It is nearly ten,” came the countess’ voice.\n“Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?”\n“I have only my cap to pin on.”\n“Don’t do it without me!” called Natásha. “You won’t do it right.”\n“But it’s already ten.”\nThey had decided to be at the ball by half-past ten, and Natásha had still\r\n      to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.\nWhen her hair was done, Natásha, in her short petticoat from under which\r\n      her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother’s dressing jacket, ran up to\r\n      Sónya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother. Turning her mother’s\r\n      head this way and that, she fastened on the cap and, hurriedly kissing her\r\n      gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her skirt.\nThe cause of the delay was Natásha’s skirt, which was too long. Two maids\r\n      were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of thread. A\r\n      third with pins in her mouth was running about between the countess and\r\n      Sónya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment up high on one\r\n      uplifted hand.\n“Mávra, quicker, darling!”\n“Give me my thimble, Miss, from there...”\n“Whenever will you be ready?” asked the count coming to the door. “Here is\r\n      some scent. Perónskaya must be tired of waiting.”\n“It’s ready, Miss,” said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze dress\r\n      with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as if by this\r\n      to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what she held.\nNatásha began putting on the dress.\n“In a minute! In a minute! Don’t come in, Papa!” she cried to her father\r\n      as he opened the door—speaking from under the filmy skirt which\r\n      still covered her whole face.\nSónya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in. He was\r\n      wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was perfumed\r\n      and his hair pomaded.\n“Oh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!” cried Natásha, as she stood in\r\n      the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.\n“If you please, Miss! allow me,” said the maid, who on her knees was\r\n      pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her\r\n      mouth to the other with her tongue.\n“Say what you like,” exclaimed Sónya, in a despairing voice as she looked\r\n      at Natásha, “say what you like, it’s still too long.”\nNatásha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dresswastoo long.\n“Really, madam, it is not at all too long,” said Mávra, crawling on her\r\n      knees after her young lady.\n“Well, if it’s too long we’ll tack it up... we’ll tack it up in one\r\n      minute,” said the resolute Dunyásha taking a needle that was stuck on the\r\n      front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor, set to work\r\n      once more.\nAt that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in her cap\r\n      and velvet gown.\n“Oo-oo, my beauty!” exclaimed the count, “she looks better than any of\r\n      you!”\nHe would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside fearing to be\r\n      rumpled.\n“Mamma, your cap, more to this side,” said Natásha. “I’ll arrange it,” and\r\n      she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up her skirt could\r\n      not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn off.\n“Oh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!”\n“Never mind, I’ll run it up, it won’t show,” said Dunyásha.\n“What a beauty—a very queen!” said the nurse as she came to the\r\n      door. “And Sónya! They are lovely!”\nAt a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started.\r\n      But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.\nPerónskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she had gone\r\n      through the same process as the Rostóvs, but with less flurry—for to\r\n      her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was washed, perfumed,\r\n      and powdered in just the same way. She had washed behind her ears just as\r\n      carefully, and when she entered her drawing room in her yellow dress,\r\n      wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old lady’s maid was as full of\r\n      rapturous admiration as the Rostóvs’ servants had been.\nShe praised the Rostóvs’ toilets. They praised her taste and toilet, and\r\n      at eleven o’clock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they settled\r\n      themselves in their carriages and drove off."

    "text": "Natásha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once had\r\n      time to think of what lay before her.\nIn the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she\r\n      for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at the\r\n      ball, in those brightly lighted rooms—with music, flowers, dances,\r\n      the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The\r\n      prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true, so\r\n      out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the\r\n      carriage. She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping\r\n      over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her fur\r\n      cloak, and, beside Sónya and in front of her mother, mounted the brightly\r\n      illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then did she remember how she\r\n      must behave at a ball, and tried to assume the majestic air she considered\r\n      indispensable for a girl on such an occasion. But, fortunately for her,\r\n      she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw nothing clearly, her pulse beat a\r\n      hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed at her heart. She could not\r\n      assume that pose, which would have made her ridiculous, and she moved on\r\n      almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal\r\n      it. And this was the very attitude that became her best. Before and behind\r\n      them other visitors were entering, also talking in low tones and wearing\r\n      ball dresses. The mirrors on the landing reflected ladies in white,\r\n      pale-blue, and pink dresses, with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks\r\n      and arms.\nNatásha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection\r\n      from the others. All was blended into one brilliant procession. On\r\n      entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and greetings\r\n      deafened Natásha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still more. The\r\n      host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door for half an\r\n      hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals,“Charmé de vous\r\n      voir,”* greeted the Rostóvs and Perónskaya in the same manner.\n* “Delighted to see you.”\nThe two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her black hair,\r\n      both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess’ eye involuntarily rested\r\n      longer on the slim Natásha. She looked at her and gave her alone a special\r\n      smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess. Looking at her she may\r\n      have recalled the golden, irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her\r\n      own first ball. The host also followed Natásha with his eyes and asked the\r\n      count which was his daughter.\n“Charming!” said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.\nIn the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the\r\n      Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that\r\n      crowd. Natásha heard and felt that several people were asking about her\r\n      and looking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked her, and\r\n      this observation helped to calm her.\n“There are some like ourselves and some worse,” she thought.\nPerónskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at\r\n      the ball.\n“That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,” she\r\n      said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly hair,\r\n      who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said.\n“Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezúkhova,” said\r\n      Perónskaya, indicating Hélène who had just entered. “How lovely! She is\r\n      quite equal to Márya Antónovna. See how the men, young and old, pay court\r\n      to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince —— is quite mad about\r\n      her. But see, those two, though not good-looking, are even more run\r\n      after.”\nShe pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain\r\n      daughter.\n“She is a splendid match, a millionairess,” said Perónskaya. “And look,\r\n      here come her suitors.”\n“That is Bezúkhova’s brother, Anatole Kurágin,” she said, indicating a\r\n      handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head erect,\r\n      looking at something over the heads of the ladies. “He’s handsome, isn’t\r\n      he? I hear they will marry him to that rich girl. But your cousin,\r\n      Drubetskóy, is also very attentive to her. They say she has millions. Oh\r\n      yes, that’s the French ambassador himself!” she replied to the countess’\r\n      inquiry about Caulaincourt. “Looks as if he were a king! All the same, the\r\n      French are charming, very charming. No one more charming in society. Ah,\r\n      here she is! Yes, she is still the most beautiful of them all, our Márya\r\n      Antónovna! And how simply she is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in\r\n      spectacles is the universal Freemason,” she went on, indicating Pierre.\r\n      “Put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon!”\nPierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the crowd and\r\n      nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he were\r\n      passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through, evidently looking\r\n      for someone.\nNatásha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, “the buffoon,” as\r\n      Perónskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for them, and for her\r\n      in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to\r\n      her.\nBut before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark man\r\n      of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window talking to\r\n      a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Natásha at once recognized the\r\n      shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it was Bolkónski, who seemed\r\n      to her to have grown much younger, happier, and better-looking.\n“There’s someone else we know—Bolkónski, do you see, Mamma?” said\r\n      Natásha, pointing out Prince Andrew. “You remember, he stayed a night with\r\n      us at Otrádnoe.”\n“Oh, you know him?” said Perónskaya. “I can’t bear him.Il fait à présent la pluie et le beau temps.* He’s too proud for\r\n      anything. Takes after his father. And he’s hand in glove with Speránski,\r\n      writing some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies! There’s\r\n      one talking to him and he has turned away,” she said, pointing at him.\r\n      “I’d give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies.”\n* “He is all the rage just now.”"

    "text": "Suddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and then\r\n      back, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor entered to\r\n      the sounds of music that had immediately struck up. Behind him walked his\r\n      host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left as if\r\n      anxious to get the first moments of the reception over. The band played\r\n      the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that had been\r\n      set to it, beginning: “Alexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts you ravish\r\n      quite...” The Emperor passed on to the drawing room, the crowd made a rush\r\n      for the doors, and several persons with excited faces hurried there and\r\n      back again. Then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing room door, at\r\n      which the Emperor reappeared talking to the hostess. A young man, looking\r\n      distraught, pounced down on the ladies, asking them to move aside. Some\r\n      ladies, with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of\r\n      decorum, pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets. The men began\r\n      to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise.\nEveryone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing room\r\n      leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music. The\r\n      host followed with Márya Antónovna Narýshkina; then came ambassadors,\r\n      ministers, and various generals, whom Perónskaya diligently named. More\r\n      than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up, or preparing\r\n      to take up, their positions for the polonaise. Natásha felt that she would\r\n      be left with her mother and Sónya among a minority of women who crowded\r\n      near the wall, not having been invited to dance. She stood with her\r\n      slender arms hanging down, her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling\r\n      regularly, and with bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed\r\n      straight before her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery.\r\n      She was not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people whom\r\n      Perónskaya was pointing out—she had but one thought: “Is it possible\r\n      no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to dance? Is it\r\n      possible that not one of all these men will notice me? They do not even\r\n      seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they were saying, ‘Ah, she’s\r\n      not the one I’m after, so it’s not worth looking at her!’ No, it’s\r\n      impossible,” she thought. “They must know how I long to dance, how\r\n      splendidly I dance, and how they would enjoy dancing with me.”\nThe strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable time,\r\n      had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natásha’s ears. She wanted\r\n      to cry. Perónskaya had left them. The count was at the other end of the\r\n      room. She and the countess and Sónya were standing by themselves as in the\r\n      depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers, with no one interested in\r\n      them and not wanted by anyone. Prince Andrew with a lady passed by,\r\n      evidently not recognizing them. The handsome Anatole was smilingly talking\r\n      to a partner on his arm and looked at Natásha as one looks at a wall.\r\n      Borís passed them twice and each time turned away. Berg and his wife, who\r\n      were not dancing, came up to them.\nThis family gathering seemed humiliating to Natásha—as if there were\r\n      nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not\r\n      listen to or look at Véra, who was telling her something about her own\r\n      green dress.\nAt last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced with\r\n      three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the Rostóvs\r\n      requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they were already\r\n      close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the distinct, precise,\r\n      enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor looked smilingly\r\n      down the room. A minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing. An\r\n      aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess Bezúkhova and\r\n      asked her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and laid it on his\r\n      shoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an adept in his art,\r\n      grasping his partner firmly round her waist, with confident deliberation\r\n      started smoothly, gliding first round the edge of the circle, then at the\r\n      corner of the room he caught Hélène’s left hand and turned her, the only\r\n      sound audible, apart from the ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic\r\n      click of the spurs on his rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his\r\n      partner’s velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled\r\n      round. Natásha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she\r\n      who was dancing that first turn of the waltz.\nPrince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing\r\n      stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the\r\n      front row of the circle not far from the Rostóvs. Baron Firhoff was\r\n      talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be held\r\n      next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with Speránski and\r\n      participating in the work of the legislative commission, could give\r\n      reliable information about that sitting, concerning which various rumors\r\n      were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was gazing\r\n      now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not yet\r\n      gathered courage to enter the circle.\nPrince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor’s presence,\r\n      and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance.\nPierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.\n“You always dance. I have a protégée, the young Rostóva, here. Ask her,”\r\n       he said.\n“Where is she?” asked Bolkónski. “Excuse me!” he added, turning to the\r\n      baron, “we will finish this conversation elsewhere—at a ball one\r\n      must dance.” He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated. The\r\n      despairing, dejected expression of Natásha’s face caught his eye. He\r\n      recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her début,\r\n      remembered her conversation at the window, and with an expression of\r\n      pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostóva.\n“Allow me to introduce you to my daughter,” said the countess, with\r\n      heightened color.\n“I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess\r\n      remembers me,” said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite\r\n      belying Perónskaya’s remarks about his rudeness, and approaching Natásha\r\n      he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his\r\n      invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on Natásha’s\r\n      face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly brightened into a\r\n      happy, grateful, childlike smile.\n“I have long been waiting for you,” that frightened happy little girl\r\n      seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as she\r\n      raised her hand to Prince Andrew’s shoulder. They were the second couple\r\n      to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his day\r\n      and Natásha danced exquisitely. Her little feet in their white satin\r\n      dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently of\r\n      herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender bare\r\n      arms and neck were not beautiful—compared to Hélène’s her shoulders\r\n      looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But Hélène seemed, as it were,\r\n      hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned her\r\n      person, while Natásha was like a girl exposed for the first time, who\r\n      would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was\r\n      absolutely necessary.\nPrince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as possible\r\n      from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him,\r\n      wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked, caused by\r\n      the Emperor’s presence, he danced, and had chosen Natásha because Pierre\r\n      pointed her out to him and because she was the first pretty girl who\r\n      caught his eye; but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure\r\n      and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling so near him than the\r\n      wine of her charm rose to his head, and he felt himself revived and\r\n      rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching\r\n      the other dancers."

    "text": "After Prince Andrew, Borís came up to ask Natásha for a dance, and then\r\n      the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young men, so\r\n      that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous partners to Sónya,\r\n      she did not cease dancing all the evening. She noticed and saw nothing of\r\n      what occupied everyone else. Not only did she fail to notice that the\r\n      Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador, and how\r\n      particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or that Prince So-and-so\r\n      and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that Hélène had great\r\n      success and was honored by the special attention of So-and-so, but she did\r\n      not even see the Emperor, and only noticed that he had gone because the\r\n      ball became livelier after his departure. For one of the merry cotillions\r\n      before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner. He reminded her of\r\n      their first encounter in the Otrádnoe avenue, and how she had been unable\r\n      to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he had involuntarily\r\n      overheard her. Natásha blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse\r\n      herself, as if there had been something to be ashamed of in what Prince\r\n      Andrew had overheard.\nLike all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked meeting\r\n      someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And such was Natásha,\r\n      with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her mistakes in\r\n      speaking French. With her he behaved with special care and tenderness,\r\n      sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most unimportant\r\n      matters; he admired her shy grace. In the middle of the cotillion, having\r\n      completed one of the figures, Natásha, still out of breath, was returning\r\n      to her seat when another dancer chose her. She was tired and panting and\r\n      evidently thought of declining, but immediately put her hand gaily on the\r\n      man’s shoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.\n“I’d be glad to sit beside you and rest: I’m tired; but you see how they\r\n      keep asking me, and I’m glad of it, I’m happy and I love everybody, and\r\n      you and I understand it all,” and much, much more was said in her smile.\r\n      When her partner left her Natásha ran across the room to choose two ladies\r\n      for the figure.\n“If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be my\r\n      wife,” said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as he\r\n      watched her. She did go first to her cousin.\n“What rubbish sometimes enters one’s head!” thought Prince Andrew, “but\r\n      what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original, that she\r\n      won’t be dancing here a month before she will be married.... Such as she\r\n      are rare here,” he thought, as Natásha, readjusting a rose that was\r\n      slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.\nWhen the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the\r\n      dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked his\r\n      daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Natásha did not answer at once\r\n      but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: “How can you ask\r\n      such a question?”\n“I have never enjoyed myself so much before!” she said, and Prince Andrew\r\n      noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father and\r\n      instantly dropped again. Natásha was happier than she had ever been in her\r\n      life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely kind and\r\n      good and does not believe in the possibility of evil, unhappiness, or\r\n      sorrow.\nAt that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his\r\n      wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A deep\r\n      furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared over\r\n      his spectacles seeing no one.\nOn her way to supper Natásha passed him.\nPierre’s gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him. She\r\n      wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own\r\n      happiness.\n“How delightful it is, Count!” said she. “Isn’t it?”\nPierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.\n“Yes, I am very glad,” he said.\n“How can people be dissatisfied with anything?” thought Natásha.\r\n      “Especially such a capital fellow as Bezúkhov!” In Natásha’s eyes all the\r\n      people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid people, loving one\r\n      another; none of them capable of injuring another—and so they ought\r\n      all to be happy."

    "text": "Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell on\r\n      it long. “Yes, it was a very brilliant ball,” and then... “Yes, that\r\n      little Rostóva is very charming. There’s something fresh, original,\r\n      un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.” That was all he\r\n      thought about yesterday’s ball, and after his morning tea he set to work.\nBut either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work and\r\n      could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work, as he often did,\r\n      and was glad when he heard someone coming.\nThe visitor was Bítski, who served on various committees, frequented all\r\n      the societies in Petersburg, and was a passionate devotee of the new ideas and\r\n      of Speránski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger—one of those men\r\n      who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion, but\r\n      who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans. Hardly had he\r\n      got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince Andrew’s room with a\r\n      preoccupied air and at once began talking. He had just heard particulars\r\n      of that morning’s sitting of the Council of State opened by the Emperor,\r\n      and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The Emperor’s speech had been\r\n      extraordinary. It had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs\r\n      deliver. “The Sovereign plainly said that the Council and Senate areestatesof the realm, he said that the government must rest not on\r\n      authority but on secure bases. The Emperor said that the fiscal system\r\n      must be reorganized and the accounts published,” recounted Bítski,\r\n      emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly.\n“Ah, yes! Today’s events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our\r\n      history,” he concluded.\nPrince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of\r\n      State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached\r\n      such importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had taken\r\n      place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He\r\n      listened with quiet irony to Bítski’s enthusiastic account of it. A very\r\n      simple thought occurred to him: “What does it matter to me or to Bítski\r\n      what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that make me\r\n      any happier or better?”\nAnd this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince\r\n      Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that\r\n      evening at Speránski’s, “with only a few friends,” as the host had said\r\n      when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle\r\n      of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince Andrew, especially\r\n      as he had not yet seen Speránski in his domestic surroundings, but now he\r\n      felt disinclined to go to it.\nAt the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house Speránski\r\n      owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room of this small\r\n      house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a\r\n      monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly\r\n      gathering of Speránski’s intimate acquaintances already assembled at five\r\n      o’clock. There were no ladies present except Speránski’s little daughter\r\n      (long-faced like her father) and her governess. The other guests were\r\n      Gervais, Magnítski, and Stolýpin. While still in the anteroom Prince\r\n      Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh—a laugh such\r\n      as one hears on the stage. Someone—it sounded like Speránski—was\r\n      distinctly ejaculatingha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew had never before heard\r\n      Speránski’s famous laugh, and this ringing, high-pitched laughter from a\r\n      statesman made a strange impression on him.\nHe entered the dining room. The whole company were standing between two\r\n      windows at a small table laid with hors-d’oeuvres. Speránski, wearing a\r\n      gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still the\r\n      same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the\r\n      Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His\r\n      guests surrounded him. Magnítski, addressing himself to Speránski, was\r\n      relating an anecdote, and Speránski was laughing in advance at what\r\n      Magnítski was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room\r\n      Magnítski’s words were again crowned by laughter. Stolýpin gave a deep\r\n      bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed\r\n      softly with a hissing chuckle, and Speránski in a high-pitched staccato\r\n      manner.\nStill laughing, Speránski held out his soft white hand to Prince Andrew.\n“Very pleased to see you, Prince,” he said. “One moment...” he went on,\r\n      turning to Magnítski and interrupting his story. “We have agreed that this\r\n      is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about business!” and turning\r\n      again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.\nPrince Andrew looked at the laughing Speránski with astonishment, regret,\r\n      and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not Speránski but\r\n      someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and\r\n      fascinating in Speránski suddenly became plain and unattractive.\nAt dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to\r\n      consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before Magnítski had\r\n      finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something still\r\n      funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state service,\r\n      related to people in the service. It seemed that in this company the\r\n      insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted that the only\r\n      possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule. Speránski\r\n      related how at the Council that morning a deaf dignitary, when asked his\r\n      opinion, replied that he thought so too. Gervais gave a long account of an\r\n      official revision, remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned.\r\n      Stolýpin, stuttering, broke into the conversation and began excitedly\r\n      talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of things—threatening\r\n      to give a serious turn to the conversation. Magnítski starting quizzing\r\n      Stolýpin about his vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk\r\n      reverted to its former lively tone.\nEvidently Speránski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in a\r\n      circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried to\r\n      enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew\r\n      mirthless and tiresome. Speránski’s high-pitched voice struck him\r\n      unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false note.\r\n      Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the\r\n      spirits of the company, but no one took any notice of his being out of\r\n      harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very gay.\nHe tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were\r\n      tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could\r\n      not jest with them.\nThere was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and\r\n      might have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the salt\r\n      of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed.\nAfter dinner Speránski’s daughter and her governess rose. He patted the\r\n      little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture, too,\r\n      seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.\nThe men remained at table over their port—English fashion. In the\r\n      midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon’s Spanish affairs,\r\n      which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to express a\r\n      contrary opinion. Speránski smiled and, with an evident wish to prevent\r\n      the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a story that had\r\n      no connection with the previous conversation. For a few moments all were\r\n      silent.\nHaving sat some time at table, Speránski corked a bottle of wine and,\r\n      remarking, “Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,” passed it to\r\n      the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly went into\r\n      the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed to\r\n      Speránski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left the room\r\n      the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly\r\n      and quietly with one another.\n“Now for the recitation!” said Speránski on returning from his study. “A\r\n      wonderful talent!” he said to Prince Andrew, and Magnítski immediately\r\n      assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in French which he\r\n      had composed about various well-known Petersburg people. He was\r\n      interrupted several times by applause. When the verses were finished\r\n      Prince Andrew went up to Speránski and took his leave.\n“Where are you off to so early?” asked Speránski.\n“I promised to go to a reception.”\nThey said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike,\r\n      impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have\r\n      expected anything from Speránski and from any of his own activities\r\n      connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what\r\n      Speránski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince\r\n      Andrew’s ears long after he had left the house.\nWhen he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in\r\n      Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He\r\n      recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project\r\n      of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they\r\n      were trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor\r\n      one, had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought of\r\n      the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered how\r\n      carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was\r\n      discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all that\r\n      related to the gist of the business was evaded. He recalled his labors on\r\n      the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of\r\n      the Roman and French codes into Russian, and he felt ashamed of himself.\r\n      Then he vividly pictured to himself Boguchárovo, his occupations in the\r\n      country, his journey to Ryazán; he remembered the peasants and Dron the\r\n      village elder, and mentally applying to them the Personal Rights he had\r\n      divided into paragraphs, he felt astonished that he could have spent so\r\n      much time on such useless work."

    "text": "Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before,\r\n      and among them at the Rostóvs’ with whom he had renewed acquaintance at\r\n      the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the call,\r\n      he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a pleasant\r\n      impression on his mind, in her own home.\nNatásha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a dark-blue\r\n      house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in her\r\n      ball dress. She and all the Rostóv family welcomed him as an old friend,\r\n      simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly judged\r\n      severely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple, and kindly\r\n      people. The old count’s hospitality and good nature, which struck one\r\n      especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such that Prince\r\n      Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. “Yes,” he thought, “they are\r\n      capital people, who of course have not the slightest idea what a treasure\r\n      they possess in Natásha; but they are kindly folk and form the best\r\n      possible setting for this strikingly poetic, charming girl, overflowing\r\n      with life!”\nIn Natásha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely alien\r\n      to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world, that in the\r\n      Otrádnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already begun\r\n      to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no longer and was no\r\n      longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it found in it a new\r\n      enjoyment.\nAfter dinner Natásha, at Prince Andrew’s request, went to the clavichord\r\n      and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies\r\n      and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and\r\n      suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought impossible for\r\n      him. He looked at Natásha as she sang, and something new and joyful\r\n      stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad. He had\r\n      absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep. What about? His\r\n      former love? The little princess? His disillusionments?... His hopes for\r\n      the future?... Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden, vivid sense of\r\n      the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and illimitable\r\n      within him and that limited and material something that he, and even she,\r\n      was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang.\nAs soon as Natásha had finished she went up to him and asked how he liked\r\n      her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling that she ought\r\n      not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he liked her\r\n      singing as he liked everything she did.\nPrince Andrew left the Rostóvs’ late in the evening. He went to bed from\r\n      habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having lit his candle he\r\n      sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again not at all troubled by his\r\n      sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had stepped out\r\n      of a stuffy room into God’s own fresh air. It did not enter his head that\r\n      he was in love with Natásha; he was not thinking about her, but only\r\n      picturing her to himself, and in consequence all life appeared in a new\r\n      light. “Why do I strive, why do I toil in this narrow, confined frame,\r\n      when life, all life with all its joys, is open to me?” said he to himself.\r\n      And for the first time for a very long while he began making happy plans\r\n      for the future. He decided that he must attend to his son’s education by\r\n      finding a tutor and putting the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire\r\n      from the service and go abroad, and see England, Switzerland and Italy. “I\r\n      must use my freedom while I feel so much strength and youth in me,” he\r\n      said to himself. “Pierre was right when he said one must believe in the\r\n      possibility of happiness in order to be happy, and now I do believe in it.\r\n      Let the dead bury their dead, but while one has life one must live and be\r\n      happy!” thought he."

    "text": "One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in Moscow\r\n      and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate brand-new\r\n      uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the\r\n      Emperor Alexander wore his hair.\n“I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she could\r\n      not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate with\r\n      you,” he said with a smile.\n“What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.”\n“I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count” (Berg said this with\r\n      perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable), “and\r\n      so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wife’s friends.”\r\n       (He smiled still more pleasantly.) “I wished to ask the countess and you\r\n      to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper.”\nOnly Countess Hélène, considering the society of such people as the Bergs\r\n      beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation. Berg\r\n      explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small but\r\n      select company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though he\r\n      grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared to\r\n      run into some expense for the sake of good society—that Pierre could\r\n      not refuse, and promised to come.\n“But don’t be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten minutes to\r\n      eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is coming. He is\r\n      very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you will do me the\r\n      favor.”\nContrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the\r\n      Bergs’ house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.\nHaving prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready\r\n      for their guests’ arrival.\nIn their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures and\r\n      new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up in his new\r\n      uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always could and\r\n      should be acquainted with people above one, because only then does one get\r\n      satisfaction from acquaintances.\n“You can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I\r\n      managed from my first promotion.” (Berg measured his life not by years but\r\n      by promotions.) “My comrades are still nobodies, while I am only waiting\r\n      for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to be your\r\n      husband.” (He rose and kissed Véra’s hand, and on the way to her\r\n      straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) “And how have I\r\n      obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances. It\r\n      goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical.”\nBerg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and paused,\r\n      reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak woman who\r\n      could not understand all that constitutes a man’s dignity, what it wasein\r\n      Mann zu sein.* Véra at the same time smiling with a sense of superiority\r\n      over her good, conscientious husband, who all the same understood life\r\n      wrongly, as according to Véra all men did. Berg, judging by his wife,\r\n      thought all women weak and foolish. Véra, judging only by her husband and\r\n      generalizing from that observation, supposed that all men, though they\r\n      understand nothing and are conceited and selfish, ascribe common sense to\r\n      themselves alone.\n* To be a man.\nBerg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her lace\r\n      fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the\r\n      lips.\n“The only thing is, we mustn’t have children too soon,” he continued,\r\n      following an unconscious sequence of ideas.\n“Yes,” answered Véra, “I don’t at all want that. We must live for\r\n      society.”\n“Princess Yusúpova wore one exactly like this,” said Berg, pointing to the\r\n      fichu with a happy and kindly smile.\nJust then Count Bezúkhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced at one\r\n      another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming\r\n      the honor of this visit.\n“This is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,” thought Berg.\r\n      “This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.”\n“But please don’t interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,” said\r\n      Véra, “because I know what interests each of them and what to say to\r\n      different people.”\nBerg smiled again.\n“It can’t be helped: men must sometimes have masculine conversation,” said\r\n      he.\nThey received Pierre in their small, new drawing room, where it was\r\n      impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry, neatness,\r\n      and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that Berg,\r\n      having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair or of the\r\n      sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully undecided on the\r\n      matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle the question of\r\n      selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself,\r\n      and Berg and Véra immediately began their evening party, interrupting each\r\n      other in their efforts to entertain their guest.\nVéra, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be entertained\r\n      with conversation about the French embassy, at once began accordingly.\r\n      Berg, having decided that masculine conversation was required, interrupted\r\n      his wife’s remarks and touched on the question of the war with Austria,\r\n      and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal\r\n      considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the Austrian\r\n      campaign and the reasons why he had declined them. Though the conversation\r\n      was very incoherent and Véra was angry at the intrusion of the masculine\r\n      element, both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that, even if only\r\n      one guest was present, their evening had begun very well and was as like\r\n      as two peas to every other evening party with its talk, tea, and lighted\r\n      candles.\nBefore long Borís, Berg’s old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of\r\n      condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Véra. After Borís\r\n      came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the Rostóvs,\r\n      and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening\r\n      parties. Berg and Véra could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at\r\n      the sight of all this movement in their drawing room, at the sound of the\r\n      disconnected talk, the rustling of dresses, and the bowing and scraping.\r\n      Everything was just as everybody always has it, especially so the general,\r\n      who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the shoulder, and with parental\r\n      authority superintended the setting out of the table for boston. The\r\n      general sat down by Count Ilyá Rostóv, who was next to himself the most\r\n      important guest. The old people sat with the old, the young with the\r\n      young, and the hostess at the tea table, on which stood exactly the same\r\n      kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as the Panins had at their party.\r\n      Everything was just as it was everywhere else."

    "text": "Pierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston with\r\n      Count Rostóv, the general, and the colonel. At the card table he happened\r\n      to be directly facing Natásha, and was struck by a curious change that had\r\n      come over her since the ball. She was silent, and not only less pretty\r\n      than at the ball, but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle\r\n      indifference to everything around.\n“What’s the matter with her?” thought Pierre, glancing at her. She was\r\n      sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without looking\r\n      at him, made some reply to Borís who sat down beside her. After playing\r\n      out a whole suit and to his partner’s delight taking five tricks, Pierre,\r\n      hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the room while\r\n      he was picking up his tricks, glanced again at Natásha.\n“What has happened to her?” he asked himself with still greater surprise.\nPrince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her with a look\r\n      of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was looking up at him,\r\n      flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing. And the bright\r\n      glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again alight in her.\r\n      She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what\r\n      she had been at the ball.\nPrince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and youthful\r\n      expression in his friend’s face.\nPierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with his\r\n      back to Natásha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six\r\n      rubbers he watched her and his friend.\n“Something very important is happening between them,” thought Pierre, and\r\n      a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him\r\n      neglect the game.\nAfter six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing\r\n      like that, and Pierre was released. Natásha on one side was talking with\r\n      Sónya and Borís, and Véra with a subtle smile was saying something to\r\n      Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they were\r\n      talking secrets, sat down beside them. Véra, having noticed Prince\r\n      Andrew’s attentions to Natásha, decided that at a party, a real evening\r\n      party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary\r\n      and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation\r\n      with him about feelings in general and about her sister. With so\r\n      intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that\r\n      she had to employ her diplomatic tact.\nWhen Pierre went up to them he noticed that Véra was being carried away by\r\n      her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a\r\n      thing that rarely happened with him.\n“What do you think?” Véra was saying with an arch smile. “You are so\r\n      discerning, Prince, and understand people’s characters so well at a\r\n      glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her\r\n      attachments? Could she, like other women” (Véra meant herself), “love a\r\n      man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is what I consider\r\n      true love. What do you think, Prince?”\n“I know your sister too little,” replied Prince Andrew, with a sarcastic\r\n      smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, “to be able to\r\n      solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed that the less\r\n      attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be,” he added,\r\n      and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.\n“Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days,” continued Véra—mentioning\r\n      “our days” as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing, imagining\r\n      that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of “our days”\r\n       and that human characteristics change with the times—“in our days a\r\n      girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles\r\n      real feeling in her. And it must be confessed that Natalie is very\r\n      susceptible.” This return to the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew\r\n      to knit his brows with discomfort: he was about to rise, but Véra\r\n      continued with a still more subtle smile:\n“I think no one has been more courted than she,” she went on, “but till\r\n      quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you know, Count,”\r\n       she said to Pierre, “even our dear cousin Borís, who, between ourselves,\r\n      was very far gone in the land of tenderness...” (alluding to a map of love\r\n      much in vogue at that time).\nPrince Andrew frowned and remained silent.\n“You are friendly with Borís, aren’t you?” asked Véra.\n“Yes, I know him....”\n“I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natásha?”\n“Oh, there was childish love?” suddenly asked Prince Andrew, blushing\r\n      unexpectedly.\n“Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love.Le cousinage\r\n      est un dangereux voisinage.* Don’t you think so?”\n* “Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.”\n“Oh, undoubtedly!” said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural\r\n      liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful with\r\n      his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these jesting\r\n      remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.\n“Well?” asked Pierre, seeing his friend’s strange animation with surprise,\r\n      and noticing the glance he turned on Natásha as he rose.\n“I must... I must have a talk with you,” said Prince Andrew. “You know\r\n      that pair of women’s gloves?” (He referred to the Masonic gloves given to\r\n      a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he loved.) “I... but no,\r\n      I will talk to you later on,” and with a strange light in his eyes and\r\n      restlessness in his movements, Prince Andrew approached Natásha and sat\r\n      down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince Andrew asked her something and how\r\n      she flushed as she replied.\nBut at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he should\r\n      take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on the\r\n      affairs in Spain.\nBerg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his face.\r\n      The party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen.\r\n      Everything was similar: the ladies’ subtle talk, the cards, the general\r\n      raising his voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea cakes;\r\n      only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening parties\r\n      he wished to imitate. They had not yet had a loud conversation among the\r\n      men and a dispute about something important and clever. Now the general\r\n      had begun such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it."

    "text": "Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with the\r\n      Rostóvs and spent the rest of the day there.\nEveryone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came, and\r\n      without concealing it he tried to be with Natásha all day. Not only in the\r\n      soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natásha, but in the whole\r\n      house, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was bound to\r\n      happen. The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes at Prince\r\n      Andrew when he talked to Natásha and timidly started some artificial\r\n      conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way. Sónya was afraid\r\n      to leave Natásha and afraid of being in the way when she was with them.\r\n      Natásha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when she remained alone with\r\n      him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by his timidity. She felt\r\n      that he wanted to say something to her but could not bring himself to do\r\n      so.\nIn the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to\r\n      Natásha and whispered: “Well, what?”\n“Mamma! For heaven’s sake don’t ask me anything now! One can’t talk about\r\n      that,” said Natásha.\nBut all the same that night Natásha, now agitated and now frightened, lay\r\n      a long time in her mother’s bed gazing straight before her. She told her\r\n      how he had complimented her, how he told her he was going abroad, asked\r\n      her where they were going to spend the summer, and then how he had asked\r\n      her about Borís.\n“But such a... such a... never happened to me before!” she said. “Only I\r\n      feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I’m with him. What\r\n      does that mean? Does it mean that it’s the real thing? Yes? Mamma, are you\r\n      asleep?”\n“No, my love; I am frightened myself,” answered her mother. “Now go!”\n“All the same I shan’t sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy! Mummy! such\r\n      a thing never happened to me before,” she said, surprised and alarmed at\r\n      the feeling she was aware of in herself. “And could we ever have\r\n      thought!...”\nIt seemed to Natásha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew at\r\n      Otrádnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she feared this\r\n      strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then\r\n      chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding him, as\r\n      it seemed, not indifferent to her.\n“And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while we\r\n      are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that ball. It is\r\n      fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this! Alreadythen,\r\n      directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.”\n“What else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...” said\r\n      her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew had\r\n      written in Natásha’s album.\n“Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?”\n“Don’t, Natásha! Pray to God. ‘Marriages are made in heaven,’” said her\r\n      mother.\n“Darling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!” cried Natásha, shedding\r\n      tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.\nAt that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him of\r\n      his love for Natásha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.\nThat day Countess Hélène had a reception at her house. The French\r\n      ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late\r\n      become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and\r\n      gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and\r\n      struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.\nSince the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and\r\n      had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of his wife\r\n      with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a gentleman of\r\n      the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel oppressed and\r\n      ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things\r\n      human came to him oftener than before. At the same time the feeling he had\r\n      noticed between his protégée Natásha and Prince Andrew accentuated his\r\n      gloom by the contrast between his own position and his friend’s. He tried\r\n      equally to avoid thinking about his wife, and about Natásha and Prince\r\n      Andrew; and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison\r\n      with eternity; again the question: for what? presented itself; and he\r\n      forced himself to work day and night at Masonic labors, hoping to drive\r\n      away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward midnight, after he had\r\n      left the countess’ apartments, he was sitting upstairs in a shabby\r\n      dressing gown, copying out the original transaction of the Scottish lodge\r\n      of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke, when\r\n      someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.\n“Ah, it’s you!” said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air. “And I,\r\n      you see, am hard at it.” He pointed to his manuscript book with that air\r\n      of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their\r\n      work.\nPrince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on his\r\n      face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look, smiled at\r\n      him with the egotism of joy.\n“Well, dear heart,” said he, “I wanted to tell you about it yesterday and\r\n      I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything like it before. I\r\n      am in love, my friend!”\nSuddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on the\r\n      sofa beside Prince Andrew.\n“With Natásha Rostóva, yes?” said he.\n“Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it, but the\r\n      feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and suffered, but\r\n      I would not exchange even that torment for anything in the world, I have\r\n      not lived till now. At last I live, but I can’t live without her! But can\r\n      she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why don’t you speak?”\n“I? I? What did I tell you?” said Pierre suddenly, rising and beginning to\r\n      pace up and down the room. “I always thought it.... That girl is such a\r\n      treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend, I entreat you, don’t\r\n      philosophize, don’t doubt, marry, marry, marry.... And I am sure there\r\n      will not be a happier man than you.”\n“But what of her?”\n“She loves you.”\n“Don’t talk rubbish...” said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into\r\n      Pierre’s eyes.\n“She does, I know,” Pierre cried fiercely.\n“But do listen,” returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the arm. “Do you\r\n      know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone.”\n“Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,” said Pierre, and his face really\r\n      changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince Andrew.\r\n      Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite a new man.\r\n      Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his disillusionment? Pierre\r\n      was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly; and to\r\n      him he told all that was in his soul. Now he boldly and lightly made plans\r\n      for an extended future, said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to\r\n      his father’s caprice, and spoke of how he would either make his father\r\n      consent to this marriage and love her, or would do without his consent;\r\n      then he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something\r\n      strange, apart from and independent of himself.\n“I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of such\r\n      love,” said Prince Andrew. “It is not at all the same feeling that I knew\r\n      in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two halves: one\r\n      half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the other half is\r\n      everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and darkness....”\n“Darkness and gloom,” reiterated Pierre: “yes, yes, I understand that.”\n“I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very happy!\r\n      You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.”\n“Yes, yes,” Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched and sad\r\n      expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew’s lot appeared to him,\r\n      the gloomier seemed his own."

    "text": "Prince Andrew needed his father’s consent to his marriage, and to obtain\r\n      this he started for the country next day.\nHis father received his son’s communication with external composure, but\r\n      inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his\r\n      life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life was already\r\n      ending. “If only they would let me end my days as I want to,” thought the\r\n      old man, “then they might do as they please.” With his son, however, he\r\n      employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and, adopting a\r\n      quiet tone, discussed the whole matter.\nIn the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards birth,\r\n      wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young as he had\r\n      been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress on this),\r\n      while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would be a pity to\r\n      entrust to a chit of a girl. “Fourthly and finally,” the father said,\r\n      looking ironically at his son, “I beg you to put it off for a year: go\r\n      abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for a German tutor for\r\n      Prince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion or obstinacy—as you\r\n      please—is still as great, marry! And that’s my last word on it.\r\n      Mind, the last...” concluded the prince, in a tone which showed that\r\n      nothing would make him alter his decision.\nPrince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or his\r\n      fiancée’s, would not stand a year’s test, or that he (the old prince\r\n      himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his father’s\r\n      wish—to propose, and postpone the wedding for a year.\nThree weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostóvs, Prince\r\n      Andrew returned to Petersburg.\n\nNext day after her talk with her mother Natásha expected Bolkónski all\r\n      day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same.\r\n      Pierre did not come either and Natásha, not knowing that Prince Andrew had\r\n      gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.\nThree weeks passed in this way. Natásha had no desire to go out anywhere\r\n      and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and listless; she wept\r\n      secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings. She\r\n      blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her that everybody\r\n      knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her.\r\n      Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity intensified her\r\n      misery.\nOnce she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began to\r\n      cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why it is\r\n      being punished.\nThe countess began to soothe Natásha, who after first listening to her\r\n      mother’s words, suddenly interrupted her:\n“Leave off, Mamma! I don’t think, and don’t want to think about it! He\r\n      just came and then left off, left off....”\nHer voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went on\r\n      quietly:\n“And I don’t at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I have\r\n      now become quite calm, quite calm.”\nThe day after this conversation Natásha put on the old dress which she\r\n      knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the\r\n      mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had\r\n      abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to the\r\n      ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and began\r\n      singing her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise she stood\r\n      still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that\r\n      particularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not\r\n      expected it) to the charm of the notes reverberating, filling the whole\r\n      empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt cheerful.\r\n      “What’s the good of making so much of it? Things are nice as it is,” she\r\n      said to herself, and she began walking up and down the room, not stepping\r\n      simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel\r\n      to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes) and listening to\r\n      the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe as gladly as she had to\r\n      the sounds of her own voice. Passing a mirror she glanced into it. “There,\r\n      that’s me!” the expression of her face seemed to say as she caught sight\r\n      of herself. “Well, and very nice too! I need nobody.”\nA footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she\r\n      would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her\r\n      walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite mood—love of,\r\n      and delight in, herself. “How charming that Natásha is!” she said again,\r\n      speaking as some third, collective, male person. “Pretty, a good voice,\r\n      young, and in nobody’s way if only they leave her in peace.” But however\r\n      much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace, and immediately\r\n      felt this.\nIn the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, “At home?” and then\r\n      footsteps were heard. Natásha was looking at the mirror, but did not see\r\n      herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw herself, her\r\n      face was pale. It washe. She knew this for certain, though she hardly\r\n      heard his voice through the closed doors.\nPale and agitated, Natásha ran into the drawing room.\n“Mamma! Bolkónski has come!” she said. “Mamma, it is awful, it is\r\n      unbearable! I don’t want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...”\nBefore the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with an\r\n      agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Natásha his face brightened.\r\n      He kissed the countess’ hand and Natásha’s, and sat down beside the sofa.\n“It is long since we had the pleasure...” began the countess, but Prince\r\n      Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question, obviously in\r\n      haste to say what he had to.\n“I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my\r\n      father’s. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only got\r\n      back last night,” he said glancing at Natásha; “I want to have a talk with\r\n      you, Countess,” he added after a moment’s pause.\nThe countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.\n“I am at your disposal,” she murmured.\nNatásha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so: something\r\n      gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared straight at\r\n      Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.\n“At once? This instant!... No, it can’t be!” she thought.\nAgain he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not\r\n      mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be decided.\n“Go, Natásha! I will call you,” said the countess in a whisper.\nNatásha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at her\r\n      mother and went out.\n“I have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter’s hand,” said Prince\r\n      Andrew.\nThe countess’ face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.\n“Your offer...” she began at last sedately. He remained silent, looking\r\n      into her eyes. “Your offer...” (she grew confused) “is agreeable to us,\r\n      and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I hope... but it\r\n      will depend on her....”\n“I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to me?”\r\n       said Prince Andrew.\n“Yes,” replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with a\r\n      mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his\r\n      forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a son,\r\n      but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. “I am sure my\r\n      husband will consent,” said the countess, “but your father...”\n“My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express condition\r\n      of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year. And I\r\n      wished to tell you of that,” said Prince Andrew.\n“It is true that Natásha is still young, but—so long as that?...”\n“It is unavoidable,” said Prince Andrew with a sigh.\n“I will send her to you,” said the countess, and left the room.\n“Lord have mercy upon us!” she repeated while seeking her daughter.\nSónya said that Natásha was in her bedroom. Natásha was sitting on the\r\n      bed, pale and dry-eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering\r\n      something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped up\r\n      and flew to her.\n“Well, Mamma?... Well?...”\n“Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand,” said the countess, coldly it\r\n      seemed to Natásha. “Go... go,” said the mother, sadly and reproachfully,\r\n      with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.\nNatásha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she came\r\n      in and saw him she paused. “Is it possible that this stranger has now\r\n      becomeeverythingto me?” she asked herself, and immediately answered,\r\n      “Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than everything in the\r\n      world.” Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes.\n“I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?”\nHe looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of\r\n      her face. Her face said: “Why ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know? Why\r\n      speak, when words cannot express what one feels?”\nShe drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.\n“Do you love me?”\n“Yes, yes!” Natásha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed loudly\r\n      and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.\n“What is it? What’s the matter?”\n“Oh, I am so happy!” she replied, smiled through her tears, bent over\r\n      closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she\r\n      might, and then kissed him.\nPrince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find in\r\n      his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly changed;\r\n      there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire, but\r\n      there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear at her\r\n      devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty\r\n      that now bound him to her forever. The present feeling, though not so\r\n      bright and poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious.\n“Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?” asked Prince\r\n      Andrew, still looking into her eyes.\n“Is it possible that I—the ‘chit of a girl,’ as everybody\r\n      called me,” thought Natásha—“is it possible that I am now to be\r\n      thewifeand the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father\r\n      looks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no more playing\r\n      with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies a responsibility\r\n      for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask me?”\n“No,” she replied, but she had not understood his question.\n“Forgive me!” he said. “But you are so young, and I have already been\r\n      through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know\r\n      yourself.”\nNatásha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to take\r\n      in the meaning of his words.\n“Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be,” continued Prince\r\n      Andrew, “it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask you to make\r\n      me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall remain a\r\n      secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should you come to\r\n      love...” said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.\n“Why do you say that?” Natásha interrupted him. “You know that from the\r\n      very day you first came to Otrádnoe I have loved you,” she cried, quite\r\n      convinced that she spoke the truth.\n“In a year you will learn to know yourself....”\n“A whole year!” Natásha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that the\r\n      marriage was to be postponed for a year. “But why a year? Why a year?...”\nPrince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay. Natásha\r\n      did not hear him.\n“And can’t it be helped?” she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply, but his\r\n      face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.\n“It’s awful! Oh, it’s awful! awful!” Natásha suddenly cried, and again\r\n      burst into sobs. “I shall die, waiting a year: it’s impossible, it’s\r\n      awful!” She looked into her lover’s face and saw in it a look of\r\n      commiseration and perplexity.\n“No, no! I’ll do anything!” she said, suddenly checking her tears. “I am\r\n      so happy.”\nThe father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple\r\n      their blessing.\nFrom that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostóvs’ as Natásha’s\r\n      affianced lover."

    "text": "No betrothal ceremony took place and Natásha’s engagement to Bolkónski was\r\n      not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said that as he was\r\n      responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it; that he\r\n      had given his word and bound himself forever, but that he did not wish to\r\n      bind Natásha and gave her perfect freedom. If after six months she felt\r\n      that she did not love him she would have full right to reject him.\r\n      Naturally neither Natásha nor her parents wished to hear of this, but\r\n      Prince Andrew was firm. He came every day to the Rostóvs’, but did not\r\n      behave to Natásha as an affianced lover: he did not use the familiarthou,\r\n      but saidyouto her, and kissed only her hand. After their engagement,\r\n      quite different, intimate, and natural relations sprang up between them.\r\n      It was as if they had not known each other till now. Both liked to recall\r\n      how they had regarded each other when as yet they werenothingto one\r\n      another; they felt themselves now quite different beings: then they were\r\n      artificial, now natural and sincere. At first the family felt some\r\n      constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew; he seemed a man from another\r\n      world, and for a long time Natásha trained the family to get used to him,\r\n      proudly assuring them all that he only appeared to be different, but was\r\n      really just like all of them, and that she was not afraid of him and no\r\n      one else ought to be. After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and\r\n      without restraint in his presence pursued their usual way of life, in\r\n      which he took his part. He could talk about rural economy with the count,\r\n      fashions with the countess and Natásha, and about albums and fancywork\r\n      with Sónya. Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his\r\n      presence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the\r\n      evident omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew’s coming to Otrádnoe and\r\n      their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Natásha and Prince\r\n      Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrew’s\r\n      encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents betokening that\r\n      it had to be.\nIn the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always\r\n      accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting\r\n      together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and go\r\n      away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely spoke\r\n      of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to speak of it.\r\n      Natásha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she constantly\r\n      divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince Andrew\r\n      blushed, as he often did now—Natásha particularly liked it in him—and\r\n      said that his son would not live with them.\n“Why not?” asked Natásha in a frightened tone.\n“I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...”\n“How I should have loved him!” said Natásha, immediately guessing his\r\n      thought; “but I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding fault with\r\n      us.”\nSometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask his\r\n      advice about Pétya’s education or Nicholas’ service. The old countess\r\n      sighed as she looked at them; Sónya was always getting frightened lest she\r\n      should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving them alone,\r\n      even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew spoke (he could tell a\r\n      story very well), Natásha listened to him with pride; when she spoke she\r\n      noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and scrutinizingly at\r\n      her. She asked herself in perplexity: “What does he look for in me? He is\r\n      trying to discover something by looking at me! What if what he seeks in me\r\n      is not there?” Sometimes she fell into one of the mad, merry moods\r\n      characteristic of her, and then she particularly loved to hear and see how\r\n      Prince Andrew laughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned\r\n      himself entirely to his laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt\r\n      nearer to him. Natásha would have been completely happy if the thought of\r\n      the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just\r\n      as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and cold.\nOn the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with him\r\n      Pierre, who had not been to the Rostóvs’ once since the ball. Pierre\r\n      seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the countess, and\r\n      Natásha sat down beside a little chess table with Sónya, thereby inviting\r\n      Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.\n“You have known Bezúkhov a long time?” he asked. “Do you like him?”\n“Yes, he’s a dear, but very absurd.”\nAnd as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his\r\n      absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.\n“Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him from\r\n      childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,” Prince Andrew said\r\n      with sudden seriousness—“I am going away and heaven knows what may\r\n      happen. You may cease to... all right, I know I am not to say that. Only\r\n      this, then: whatever may happen to you when I am not here...”\n“What can happen?”\n“Whatever trouble may come,” Prince Andrew continued, “I beg you,\r\n      Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for advice\r\n      and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he has a heart\r\n      of gold.”\nNeither her father, nor her mother, nor Sónya, nor Prince Andrew himself\r\n      could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on\r\n      Natásha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day,\r\n      dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding what\r\n      awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed her\r\n      hand for the last time. “Don’t go!” she said in a tone that made him\r\n      wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long\r\n      afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but for several days she sat\r\n      in her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in anything and only saying now\r\n      and then, “Oh, why did he go away?”\nBut a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around her,\r\n      she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became her old\r\n      self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a child gets up\r\n      after a long illness with a changed expression of face."

    "text": "During that year after his son’s departure, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski’s\r\n      health and temper became much worse. He grew still more irritable, and it\r\n      was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits of\r\n      unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so as\r\n      to torture her mentally as harshly as possible. Princess Mary had two\r\n      passions and consequently two joys—her nephew, little Nicholas, and\r\n      religion—and these were the favorite subjects of the prince’s\r\n      attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the\r\n      superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting and spoiling of children.\r\n      “You want to make him”—little Nicholas—“into an old maid like\r\n      yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew wants a son and not an old maid,” he would\r\n      say. Or, turning to Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess\r\n      Mary’s presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke\r\n      about them.\nHe continually hurt Princess Mary’s feelings and tormented her, but it\r\n      cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, or\r\n      could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust?\r\n      And what is justice? The princess never thought of that proud word\r\n      “justice.” All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and\r\n      simple law—the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who\r\n      lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God. What had she to\r\n      do with the justice or injustice of other people? She had to endure and\r\n      love, and that she did.\nDuring the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay,\r\n      gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a long\r\n      time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said\r\n      nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with his\r\n      father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his\r\n      departure they were dissatisfied with one another.\nSoon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend Julie\r\n      Karágina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream) of\r\n      marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her own\r\n      brother, killed in Turkey.\nSorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.\nYour loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a special\r\n      providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your excellent\r\n      mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can—I will not\r\n      say comfort us—but save us from despair. Religion alone can explain\r\n      to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what cause,\r\n      kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life—not merely\r\n      harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others—are called\r\n      away to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a\r\n      burden to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I\r\n      saw, and one I shall never forget—that of my dear sister-in-law—left\r\n      that impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother\r\n      had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged\r\n      anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to\r\n      die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since\r\n      then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly why\r\n      she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression of the\r\n      infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though generally\r\n      incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite love for\r\n      His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically innocent to\r\n      have the strength to perform all a mother’s duties. As a young wife she\r\n      was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so as a mother. As it\r\n      is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince Andrew, with the\r\n      purest regrets and memories, but probably she willtherereceive a place I\r\n      dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of her alone, that early and\r\n      terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my\r\n      brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at the moment of our loss, these\r\n      thoughts could not occur to me; I should then have dismissed them with\r\n      horror, but now they are very clear and certain. I write all this to you,\r\n      dear friend, only to convince you of the Gospel truth which has become for\r\n      me a principle of life: not a single hair of our heads will fall without\r\n      His will. And His will is governed only by infinite love for us, and so\r\n      whatever befalls us is for our good.\nYou ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my wish\r\n      to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will be\r\n      surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte! The case is\r\n      this: my father’s health is growing noticeably worse, he cannot stand any\r\n      contradiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability is, as you\r\n      know, chiefly directed to political questions. He cannot endure the notion\r\n      that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of\r\n      Europe and particularly with our own, the grandson of the Great Catherine!\r\n      As you know, I am quite indifferent to politics, but from my father’s\r\n      remarks and his talks with Michael Ivánovich I know all that goes on in\r\n      the world and especially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte, who\r\n      only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is not accepted as a\r\n      great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my father cannot stand\r\n      this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views\r\n      that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he foresees\r\n      the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views\r\n      regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might derive from a course of\r\n      treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about Buonaparte which\r\n      would be inevitable. In any case it will be decided very shortly.\nOur family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrew’s\r\n      absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late. After\r\n      his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits. He has again\r\n      become as I used to know him when a child: kind, affectionate, with that\r\n      heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me,\r\n      that life is not over for him. But together with this mental change he has\r\n      grown physically much weaker. He has become thinner and more nervous. I am\r\n      anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors\r\n      recommended long ago. I hope it will cure him. You write that in\r\n      Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active, cultivated, and\r\n      capable of the young men. Forgive my vanity as a relation, but I never\r\n      doubted it. The good he has done to everybody here, from his peasants up\r\n      to the gentry, is incalculable. On his arrival in Petersburg he received\r\n      only his due. I always wonder at the way rumors fly from Petersburg to\r\n      Moscow, especially such false ones as that you write about—I mean\r\n      the report of my brother’s betrothal to the little Rostóva. I do not think\r\n      my brother will ever marry again, and certainly not her; and this is why:\r\n      first, I know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has lost, the\r\n      grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide\r\n      to give her a successor and our little angel a stepmother. Secondly\r\n      because, as far as I know, that girl is not the kind of girl who could\r\n      please Prince Andrew. I do not think he would choose her for a wife, and\r\n      frankly I do not wish it. But I am running on too long and am at the end\r\n      of my second sheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy\r\n      and mighty care. My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.\nMARY"

    "text": "In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter\r\n      from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and\r\n      surprising news. He informed her of his engagement to Natásha Rostóva. The\r\n      whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender and\r\n      confiding affection for his sister. He wrote that he had never loved as he\r\n      did now and that only now did he understand and know what life was. He\r\n      asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his resolve\r\n      when he had last visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it to his\r\n      father. He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her father to\r\n      give his consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt of his\r\n      displeasure without attaining her object. “Besides,” he wrote, “the matter\r\n      was not then so definitely settled as it is now. My father then insisted\r\n      on a delay of a year and now alreadysix months, half of that period, have\r\n      passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever. If the doctors did not keep\r\n      me here at the spas I should be back in Russia, but as it is I have to\r\n      postpone my return for three months. You know me and my relations with\r\n      Father. I want nothing from him. I have been and always shall be\r\n      independent; but to go against his will and arouse his anger, now that he\r\n      may perhaps remain with us such a short time, would destroy half my\r\n      happiness. I am now writing to him about the same question, and beg you to\r\n      choose a good moment to hand him the letter and to let me know how he\r\n      looks at the whole matter and whether there is hope that he may consent to\r\n      reduce the term by four months.”\nAfter long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the letter\r\n      to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:\n“Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won’t be long—I\r\n      shall soon set him free.”\nThe princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak\r\n      and, raising his voice more and more, cried:\n“Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich, eh?\r\n      Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell him that\r\n      he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholas’ stepmother\r\n      and I’ll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustn’t be without a\r\n      stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted in my house—let\r\n      him marry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go and live with him too?”\r\n       he added, turning to Princess Mary. “Go in heaven’s name! Go out into the\r\n      frost... the frost... the frost!”\nAfter this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.\r\n      But repressed vexation at his son’s poor-spirited behavior found\r\n      expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former pretexts for\r\n      irony a fresh one was now added—allusions to stepmothers and\r\n      amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n“Why shouldn’t I marry her?” he asked his daughter. “She’ll make a\r\n      splendid princess!”\nAnd latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary noticed that\r\n      her father was really associating more and more with the Frenchwoman. She\r\n      wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his letter, but comforted\r\n      him with hopes of reconciling their father to the idea.\nLittle Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion were\r\n      Princess Mary’s joys and consolations; but besides that, since everyone\r\n      must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest depths of her\r\n      heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of\r\n      her life. This comforting dream and hope were given her byGod’s folk—the\r\n      half-witted and other pilgrims who visited her without the prince’s\r\n      knowledge. The longer she lived, the more experience and observation she\r\n      had of life, the greater was her wonder at the short-sightedness of men\r\n      who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth: toiling, suffering,\r\n      struggling, and harming one another, to obtain that impossible, visionary,\r\n      sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had loved his wife, she died, but that was\r\n      not enough: he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman. Her father\r\n      objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier\r\n      match for Andrew. And they all struggled and suffered and tormented one\r\n      another and injured their souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment\r\n      of benefits which endure but for an instant. Not only do we know this\r\n      ourselves, but Christ, the Son of God, came down to earth and told us that\r\n      this life is but for a moment and is a probation; yet we cling to it and\r\n      think to find happiness in it. “How is it that no one realizes this?”\r\n       thought Princess Mary. “No one except these despisedGod’s folkwho,\r\n      wallet on back, come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen by the\r\n      prince, not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him to\r\n      sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, in order\r\n      without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place\r\n      under an assumed name, doing no one any harm but praying for all—for\r\n      those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one: higher than\r\n      that life and truth there is no life or truth!”\nThere was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called\r\n      Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn\r\n      heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in a\r\n      room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of her\r\n      life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of life\r\n      suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to become\r\n      a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary thought\r\n      about this for a long time, and at last made up her mind that, strange as\r\n      it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed this thought to\r\n      no one but to her confessor, Father Akínfi, the monk, and he approved of\r\n      her intention. Under guise of a present for the pilgrims, Princess Mary\r\n      prepared a pilgrim’s complete costume for herself: a coarse smock, bast\r\n      shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief. Often, approaching the chest of\r\n      drawers containing this secret treasure, Princess Mary paused, uncertain\r\n      whether the time had not already come to put her project into execution.\nOften, listening to the pilgrims’ tales, she was so stimulated by their\r\n      simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning, that\r\n      several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and running\r\n      away from home. In imagination she already pictured herself by Theodosia’s\r\n      side, dressed in coarse rags, walking with a staff, a wallet on her back,\r\n      along the dusty road, directing her wanderings from one saint’s shrine to\r\n      another, free from envy, earthly love, or desire, and reaching at last the\r\n      place where there is no more sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.\n“I shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get\r\n      used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till my\r\n      legs fail, and I’ll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at last reach\r\n      that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow nor sighing...”\r\n       thought Princess Mary.\nBut afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko\r\n      (Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she was\r\n      a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God."

    "text": "The Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor—idleness—was\r\n      a condition of the first man’s blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man has\r\n      retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not only\r\n      because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but because\r\n      our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease. An inner\r\n      voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If man could find a\r\n      state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty, he\r\n      would have found one of the conditions of man’s primitive blessedness. And\r\n      such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a\r\n      whole class—the military. The chief attraction of military service\r\n      has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable\r\n      idleness.\nNicholas Rostóv experienced this blissful condition to the full when,\r\n      after 1807, he continued to serve in the Pávlograd regiment, in which he\r\n      already commanded the squadron he had taken over from Denísov.\nRostóv had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow\r\n      acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked and\r\n      respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well\r\n      contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home\r\n      more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling\r\n      into greater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come\r\n      back to gladden and comfort his old parents.\nReading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take him\r\n      away from surroundings in which, protected from all the entanglements of\r\n      life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that sooner or later he\r\n      would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with its embarrassments and\r\n      affairs to be straightened out, its accounts with stewards, quarrels, and\r\n      intrigues, its ties, society, and with Sónya’s love and his promise to\r\n      her. It was all dreadfully difficult and complicated; and he replied to\r\n      his mother in cold, formal letters in French, beginning: “My dear Mamma,”\r\n       and ending: “Your obedient son,” which said nothing of when he would\r\n      return. In 1810 he received letters from his parents, in which they told\r\n      him of Natásha’s engagement to Bolkónski, and that the wedding would be in\r\n      a year’s time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter\r\n      grieved and mortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that\r\n      Natásha, for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family, should\r\n      be lost to the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he\r\n      regretted not to have been there to show that fellow Bolkónski that\r\n      connection with him was no such great honor after all, and that if he\r\n      loved Natásha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father.\r\n      For a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order\r\n      to see Natásha before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and\r\n      considerations about Sónya and about the confusion of their affairs, and\r\n      Nicholas again put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a\r\n      letter from his mother, written without his father’s knowledge, and that\r\n      letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and take\r\n      matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and they\r\n      would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted Mítenka\r\n      so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage of him and\r\n      things were going from bad to worse. “For God’s sake, I implore you, come\r\n      at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family wretched,”\r\n       wrote the countess.\nThis letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a matter-of-fact\r\n      man which showed him what he ought to do.\nThe right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate to\r\n      go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his\r\n      after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray\r\n      stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned\r\n      with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrúshka (Denísov’s servant\r\n      who had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening\r\n      that he was applying for leave and was going home. Difficult and strange\r\n      as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard\r\n      from the staff—and this interested him extremely—whether he\r\n      was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the Order of St. Anne for the\r\n      last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he would go away without\r\n      having sold his three roans to the Polish Count Golukhovski, who was\r\n      bargaining for the horses Rostóv had betted he would sell for two thousand\r\n      rubles; incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars were\r\n      giving in honor of the Polish Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to\r\n      the Uhlans who had given one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle\r\n      Borzozowska) would take place without him—he knew he must go away\r\n      from this good, bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and\r\n      confused. A week later he obtained his leave. His hussar comrades—not\r\n      only those of his own regiment, but the whole brigade—gave Rostóv a\r\n      dinner to which the subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which\r\n      there were two bands and two choirs of singers. Rostóv danced the Trepák\r\n      with Major Básov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped Rostóv;\r\n      the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted “hurrah!”\r\n       and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first\r\n      post station.\nDuring the first half of the journey—from Kremenchúg to Kiev—all\r\n      Rostóv’s thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with the\r\n      squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his\r\n      three roans and Dozhoyvéyko, his quartermaster, and to wonder anxiously\r\n      how things would be at Otrádnoe and what he would find there. Thoughts of\r\n      home grew stronger the nearer he approached it—far stronger, as\r\n      though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of\r\n      attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance. At the\r\n      last post station before Otrádnoe he gave the driver a three-ruble tip,\r\n      and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home.\nAfter the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied\r\n      expectation—the feeling that “everything is just the same, so why\r\n      did I hurry?”—Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world.\r\n      His father and mother were much the same, only a little older. What was\r\n      new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there\r\n      used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the bad\r\n      state of their affairs. Sónya was nearly twenty; she had stopped growing\r\n      prettier and promised nothing more than she was already, but that was\r\n      enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas returned,\r\n      and the faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on\r\n      him. Pétya and Natásha surprised Nicholas most. Pétya was a big handsome\r\n      boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was\r\n      already breaking. As for Natásha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and\r\n      laughed whenever he looked at her.\n“You’re not the same at all,” he said.\n“How? Am I uglier?”\n“On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!” he whispered to her.\n“Yes, yes, yes!” cried Natásha, joyfully.\nShe told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to\r\n      Otrádnoe and showed him his last letter.\n“Well, are you glad?” Natásha asked. “I am so tranquil and happy now.”\n“Very glad,” answered Nicholas. “He is an excellent fellow.... And are you\r\n      very much in love?”\n“How shall I put it?” replied Natásha. “I was in love with Borís, with my\r\n      teacher, and with Denísov, but this is quite different. I feel at peace\r\n      and settled. I know that no better man than he exists, and I am calm and\r\n      contented now. Not at all as before.”\nNicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage for\r\n      a year; but Natásha attacked her brother with exasperation, proving to him\r\n      that it could not be otherwise, and that it would be a bad thing to enter\r\n      a family against the father’s will, and that she herself wished it so.\n“You don’t at all understand,” she said.\nNicholas was silent and agreed with her.\nHer brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem at all\r\n      like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband. She was\r\n      even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed\r\n      Nicholas and even made him regard Bolkónski’s courtship skeptically. He\r\n      could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially as he had not seen\r\n      her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him that there was something\r\n      not quite right about this intended marriage.\n“Why this delay? Why no betrothal?” he thought. Once, when he had touched\r\n      on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise and somewhat\r\n      to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too had doubts\r\n      about this marriage.\n“You see he writes,” said she, showing her son a letter of Prince\r\n      Andrew’s, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a\r\n      daughter’s future married happiness, “he writes that he won’t come before\r\n      December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health is very\r\n      delicate. Don’t tell Natásha. And don’t attach importance to her being so\r\n      bright: that’s because she’s living through the last days of her girlhood,\r\n      but I know what she is like every time we receive a letter from him!\r\n      However, God grant that everything turns out well!” (She always ended with\r\n      these words.) “He is an excellent man!”"

    "text": "After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull. He was\r\n      worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business\r\n      matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw off this burden\r\n      as quickly as possible, on the third day after his arrival he went, angry\r\n      and scowling and without answering questions as to where he was going, to\r\n      Mítenka’s lodge and demanded anaccount of everything. But what anaccount of everythingmight be Nicholas knew even less than the frightened\r\n      and bewildered Mítenka. The conversation and the examination of the accounts\r\n      with Mítenka did not last long. The village elder, a peasant delegate, and\r\n      the village clerk, who were waiting in the passage, heard with fear and\r\n      delight first the young count’s voice roaring and snapping and rising\r\n      louder and louder, and then words of abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one\r\n      after the other.\n“Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I’ll hack the dog to pieces! I’m not my\r\n      father!... Robbing us!...” and so on.\nThen with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in\r\n      the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mítenka out by the scruff of the\r\n      neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility at\r\n      convenient moments between the words, shouting, “Be off! Never let me see\r\n      your face here again, you villain!”\nMítenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the shrubbery.\r\n      (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits at Otrádnoe.\r\n      Mítenka himself, returning tipsy from the town, used to hide there, and\r\n      many of the residents at Otrádnoe, hiding from Mítenka, knew of its\r\n      protective qualities.)\nMítenka’s wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened faces\r\n      out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and where the\r\n      steward’s high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt.\nThe young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by with\r\n      resolute strides and went into the house.\nThe countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the\r\n      lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly\r\n      improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this\r\n      excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his door on\r\n      tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.\nNext day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed\r\n      smile, said to him:\n“But you know, my dear boy, it’s a pity you got excited! Mítenka has told\r\n      me all about it.”\n“I knew,” thought Nicholas, “that I should never understand anything in\r\n      this crazy world.”\n“You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they were\r\n      carried forward—and you did not look at the other page.”\n“Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have done,\r\n      I have done; but, if you like, I won’t speak to him again.”\n“No, my dear boy” (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he had\r\n      mismanaged his wife’s property and was to blame toward his children, but\r\n      he did not know how to remedy it). “No, I beg you to attend to the\r\n      business. I am old. I...”\n“No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I understand it\r\n      all less than you do.”\n“Devil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings forward\r\n      from page to page,” he thought. “I used to understand what a ‘corner’ and\r\n      the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to another page I don’t\r\n      understand at all,” said he to himself, and after that he did not meddle\r\n      in business affairs. But once the countess called her son and informed him\r\n      that she had a promissory note from Anna Mikháylovna for two thousand\r\n      rubles, and asked him what he thought of doing with it.\n“This,” answered Nicholas. “You say it rests with me. Well, I don’t like\r\n      Anna Mikháylovna and I don’t like Borís, but they were our friends and\r\n      poor. Well then, this!” and he tore up the note, and by so doing caused\r\n      the old countess to weep tears of joy. After that, young Rostóv took no\r\n      further part in any business affairs, but devoted himself with passionate\r\n      enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit—the chase—for\r\n      which his father kept a large establishment."

    "text": "The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an\r\n      earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had thickened and its bright\r\n      green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden\r\n      down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the spring\r\n      buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of August\r\n      had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had become\r\n      golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The hares had\r\n      already half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were beginning to\r\n      scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was the best time\r\n      of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young sportsman\r\n      Rostóv had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were so jaded\r\n      that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a three\r\n      days’ rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on a distant\r\n      expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an undisturbed\r\n      litter of wolf cubs.\nAll that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was\r\n      sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw. On\r\n      the fifteenth, when young Rostóv, in his dressing gown, looked out of the\r\n      window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it was as if\r\n      the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind. The only\r\n      motion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic particles of\r\n      drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent\r\n      drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in the kitchen\r\n      garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short\r\n      distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist. Nicholas went out into\r\n      the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog.\r\n      Mílka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes,\r\n      got up on seeing her master, stretched her hind legs, lay down like a\r\n      hare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and\r\n      mustache. Another borzoi, a dog, catching sight of his master from the\r\n      garden path, arched his back and, rushing headlong toward the porch with\r\n      lifted tail, began rubbing himself against his legs.\n“O-hoy!” came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman’s call which unites\r\n      the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round the corner came\r\n      Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray, wrinkled old man with\r\n      hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian fashion, a long bent whip\r\n      in his hand, and that look of independence and scorn of everything that is\r\n      only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his Circassian cap to his master and\r\n      looked at him scornfully. This scorn was not offensive to his master.\r\n      Nicholas knew that this Daniel, disdainful of everybody and who considered\r\n      himself above them, was all the same his serf and huntsman.\n“Daniel!” Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the weather,\r\n      the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that\r\n      irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous\r\n      resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress.\n“What orders, your excellency?” said the huntsman in his deep bass, deep\r\n      as a proto-deacon’s and hoarse with hallooing—and two flashing black\r\n      eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent. “Can you\r\n      resist it?” those eyes seemed to be asking.\n“It’s a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?” asked Nicholas,\r\n      scratching Mílka behind the ears.\nDaniel did not answer, but winked instead.\n“I sent Uvárka at dawn to listen,” his bass boomed out after a minute’s\r\n      pause. “He saysshe’s moved theminto the Otrádnoe enclosure.\r\n      They were howling there.” (This meant that the she-wolf, about whom they both\r\n      knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otrádnoe copse, a small place a mile and a\r\n      half from the house.)\n“We ought to go, don’t you think so?” said Nicholas. “Come to me with\r\n      Uvárka.”\n“As you please.”\n“Then put off feeding them.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nFive minutes later Daniel and Uvárka were standing in Nicholas’ big study.\r\n      Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was like seeing a\r\n      horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and surroundings of human\r\n      life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual stood just inside the door,\r\n      trying to speak softly and not move, for fear of breaking something in the\r\n      master’s apartment, and he hastened to say all that was necessary so as to\r\n      get from under that ceiling, out into the open under the sky once more.\nHaving finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that the\r\n      hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nicholas ordered\r\n      the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was about to go Natásha came\r\n      in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or finished dressing and\r\n      with her old nurse’s big shawl wrapped round her. Pétya ran in at the same\r\n      time.\n“You are going?” asked Natásha. “I knew you would! Sónya said you wouldn’t\r\n      go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you couldn’t help\r\n      going.”\n“Yes, we are going,” replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he\r\n      intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Natásha and Pétya. “We\r\n      are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for you.”\n“You know it is my greatest pleasure,” said Natásha. “It’s not fair; you\r\n      are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said nothing to\r\n      us about it.”\n“‘No barrier bars a Russian’s path’—we’ll go!” shouted Pétya.\n“But you can’t. Mamma said you mustn’t,” said Nicholas to Natásha.\n“Yes, I’ll go. I shall certainly go,” said Natásha decisively. “Daniel,\r\n      tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my dogs,” she added\r\n      to the huntsman.\nIt seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but to\r\n      have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible. He cast\r\n      down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business, careful\r\n      as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young lady."

    "text": "The old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment\r\n      but had now handed it all completely over to his son’s care, being in very\r\n      good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out with the\r\n      others.\nIn an hour’s time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas, with\r\n      a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for attending to\r\n      trifles, went past Natásha and Pétya who were trying to tell him\r\n      something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent a pack of\r\n      hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his chestnut\r\n      Donéts, and whistling to his own leash of borzois, set off across the\r\n      threshing ground to a field leading to the Otrádnoe wood. The old count’s\r\n      horse, a sorrel gelding called Viflyánka, was led by the groom in\r\n      attendance on him, while the count himself was to drive in a small trap\r\n      straight to a spot reserved for him.\nThey were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and\r\n      whippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen and\r\n      more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash belonging\r\n      to members of the family, there were about a hundred and thirty dogs and\r\n      twenty horsemen.\nEach dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his\r\n      business, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the\r\n      fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk, along\r\n      the road and field leading to the Otrádnoe covert.\nThe horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and then\r\n      splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky still seemed\r\n      to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the air was still,\r\n      warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman, the snort of a\r\n      horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling hound could be\r\n      heard.\nWhen they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders with dogs\r\n      appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rostóvs. In front rode a\r\n      fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.\n“Good morning, Uncle!” said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.\n“That’s it. Come on!... I was sure of it,” began “Uncle.” (He was a\r\n      distant relative of the Rostóvs’, a man of small means, and their\r\n      neighbor.) “I knew you wouldn’t be able to resist it and it’s a good thing\r\n      you’re going. That’s it! Come on!” (This was “Uncle’s” favorite\r\n      expression.) “Take the covert at once, for my Gírchik says the Ilágins are\r\n      at Kornikí with their hounds. That’s it. Come on!... They’ll take the cubs\r\n      from under your very nose.”\n“That’s where I’m going. Shall we join up our packs?” asked Nicholas.\nThe hounds were joined into one pack, and “Uncle” and Nicholas rode on\r\n      side by side. Natásha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager\r\n      face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed by Pétya who\r\n      always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a groom appointed\r\n      to look after her. Pétya, who was laughing, whipped and pulled at his\r\n      horse. Natásha sat easily and confidently on her black Arábchik and reined\r\n      him in without effort with a firm hand.\n“Uncle” looked round disapprovingly at Pétya and Natásha. He did not like\r\n      to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.\n“Good morning, Uncle! We are going too!” shouted Pétya.\n“Good morning, good morning! But don’t go overriding the hounds,” said\r\n      “Uncle” sternly.\n“Nicholas, what a fine dog Truníla is! He knew me,” said Natásha,\r\n      referring to her favorite hound.\n“In the first place, Truníla is not a ‘dog,’ but a harrier,” thought\r\n      Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel the\r\n      distance that ought to separate them at that moment. Natásha understood\r\n      it.\n“You mustn’t think we’ll be in anyone’s way, Uncle,” she said. “We’ll go\r\n      to our places and won’t budge.”\n“A good thing too, little countess,” said “Uncle,” “only mind you don’t\r\n      fall off your horse,” he added, “because—that’s it, come on!—you’ve\r\n      nothing to hold on to.”\nThe oasis of the Otrádnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off,\r\n      the huntsmen were already nearing it. Rostóv, having finally settled with\r\n      “Uncle” where they should set on the hounds, and having shown Natásha\r\n      where she was to stand—a spot where nothing could possibly run out—went\r\n      round above the ravine.\n“Well, nephew, you’re going for a big wolf,” said “Uncle.” “Mind and don’t\r\n      let her slip!”\n“That’s as may happen,” answered Rostóv. “Karáy, here!” he shouted,\r\n      answering “Uncle’s” remark by this call to his borzoi. Karáy was a shaggy\r\n      old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided.\r\n      They all took up their places.\nThe old count, knowing his son’s ardor in the hunt, hurried so as not to\r\n      be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count Ilyá\r\n      Rostóv, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove up with his\r\n      black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him, where a\r\n      wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and fastened on his\r\n      hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed, and\r\n      comfortable horse, Viflyánka, which was turning gray, like himself. His\r\n      horses and trap were sent home. Count Ilyá Rostóv, though not at heart a\r\n      keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well, and rode to the bushy\r\n      edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged his reins, settled\r\n      himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked about with a\r\n      smile.\nBeside him was Simon Chekmár, his personal attendant, an old horseman now\r\n      somewhat stiff in the saddle. Chekmár held in leash three formidable\r\n      wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master and his horse.\r\n      Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred paces farther along the\r\n      edge of the wood stood Mítka, the count’s other groom, a daring horseman\r\n      and keen rider to hounds. Before the hunt, by old custom, the count had\r\n      drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken a snack, and washed it down\r\n      with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.\nHe was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were rather\r\n      moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his saddle, wrapped\r\n      up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out for an outing.\nThe thin, hollow-cheeked Chekmár, having got everything ready, kept\r\n      glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for\r\n      thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant\r\n      chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood (it was plain\r\n      that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count. This person was a\r\n      gray-bearded old man in a woman’s cloak, with a tall peaked cap on his\r\n      head. He was the buffoon, who went by a woman’s name, Nastásya Ivánovna.\n“Well, Nastásya Ivánovna!” whispered the count, winking at him. “If you\r\n      scare away the beast, Daniel’ll give it you!”\n“I know a thing or two myself!” said Nastásya Ivánovna.\n“Hush!” whispered the count and turned to Simon. “Have you seen the young\r\n      countess?” he asked. “Where is she?”\n“With young Count Peter, by the Zhárov rank grass,” answered Simon,\r\n      smiling. “Though she’s a lady, she’s very fond of hunting.”\n“And you’re surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?” said the count.\r\n      “She’s as good as many a man!”\n“Of course! It’s marvelous. So bold, so easy!”\n“And Nicholas? Where is he? By the Lyádov upland, isn’t he?”\n“Yes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so well that\r\n      Daniel and I are often quite astounded,” said Simon, well knowing what\r\n      would please his master.\n“Rides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?”\n“A perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the\r\n      Zavárzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight\r\n      when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles and\r\n      the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search far to find\r\n      another as smart.”\n“To search far...” repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not said\r\n      more. “To search far,” he said, turning back the skirt of his coat to get\r\n      at his snuffbox.\n“The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael\r\n      Sidórych...” Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had distinctly\r\n      caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue.\r\n      He bent down his head and listened, shaking a warning finger at his\r\n      master. “They are on the scent of the cubs...” he whispered, “straight to\r\n      the Lyádov uplands.”\nThe count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked into the\r\n      distance straight before him, down the narrow open space, holding the\r\n      snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry of the hounds came\r\n      the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel’s hunting horn; the pack\r\n      joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry, with\r\n      that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf.\r\n      The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the cry ofulyulyu, and above the others rose Daniel’s voice, now a deep bass, now\r\n      piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far\r\n      beyond out into the open field.\nAfter listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant\r\n      convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the\r\n      sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in the\r\n      distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and it was\r\n      with this that Daniel’s voice was heard callingulyulyu. The sounds of\r\n      both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were becoming more\r\n      distant.\nSimon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had\r\n      entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand,\r\n      opened it and took a pinch. “Back!” cried Simon to a borzoi that was\r\n      pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and dropped the\r\n      snuffbox. Nastásya Ivánovna dismounted to pick it up. The count and Simon\r\n      were looking at him.\nThen, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly\r\n      approached, as if the hounds in full cry and Danielulyulyuingwere just\r\n      in front of them.\nThe count turned and saw on his right Mítka staring at him with eyes\r\n      starting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to the\r\n      other side.\n“Look out!” he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had long\r\n      fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he galloped\r\n      toward the count.\nThe count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a wolf\r\n      which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet lope\r\n      farther to the left to the very place where they were standing. The angry\r\n      borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the horses’ feet\r\n      at the wolf.\nThe wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly, like\r\n      a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying from side to\r\n      side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into\r\n      the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry like a wail, first\r\n      one hound, then another, and then another, sprang helter-skelter from the\r\n      wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field toward the very\r\n      spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel bushes parted behind the\r\n      hounds and Daniel’s chestnut horse appeared, dark with sweat. On its long\r\n      back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless, his disheveled gray hair\r\n      hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.\n“Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...”he cried. When he caught sight of the count his\r\n      eyes flashed lightning.\n“Blast you!” he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the count.\n“You’ve let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!” and as if scorning to say\r\n      more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving flanks\r\n      of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had aroused\r\n      and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a punished schoolboy,\r\n      looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon’s sympathy for his plight.\r\n      But Simon was no longer there. He was galloping round by the bushes while\r\n      the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head the wolf, but it\r\n      vanished into the wood before they could do so."

    "text": "Nicholas Rostóv meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the wolf. By\r\n      the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of the dogs whose\r\n      notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen\r\n      approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was happening at the\r\n      copse. He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had\r\n      separated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and that\r\n      something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any moment.\r\n      He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and from what side\r\n      the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope alternated with\r\n      despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God that the wolf should\r\n      come his way. He prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling with\r\n      which men pray at moments of great excitement arising from trivial causes.\r\n      “What would it be to Thee to do this for me?” he said to God. “I know Thou\r\n      art great, and that it is a sin to ask this of Thee, but for God’s sake do\r\n      let the old wolf come my way and let Karáy spring at it—in sight of\r\n      ‘Uncle’ who is watching from over there—and seize it by the throat\r\n      in a death grip!” A thousand times during that half-hour Rostóv cast eager\r\n      and restless glances over the edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks\r\n      rising above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side\r\n      and “Uncle’s” cap just visible above the bush on his right.\n“No, I shan’t have such luck,” thought Rostóv, “yet what wouldn’t it be\r\n      worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am always\r\n      unlucky.” Memories of Austerlitz and of Dólokhov flashed rapidly and\r\n      clearly through his mind. “Only once in my life to get an old wolf, I want\r\n      only that!” thought he, straining eyes and ears and looking to the left\r\n      and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of note in\r\n      the cries of the dogs.\nAgain he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across\r\n      the deserted field. “No, it can’t be!” thought Rostóv, taking a deep\r\n      breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for. The\r\n      height of happiness was reached—and so simply, without warning, or\r\n      noise, or display, that Rostóv could not believe his eyes and remained in\r\n      doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over a\r\n      gully that lay in her path. She was an old animal with a gray back and big\r\n      reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no one\r\n      saw her. Rostóv, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois. They\r\n      stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation. Old Karáy\r\n      had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas, baring his yellow\r\n      teeth and snapping at his hind legs.\n“Ulyulyulyu!”whispered Rostóv, pouting his lips. The borzois jumped up,\r\n      jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears. Karáy finished\r\n      scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got up with quivering\r\n      tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.\n“Shall I loose them or not?” Nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached\r\n      him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf’s whole physiognomy changed:\r\n      she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never seen before—human\r\n      eyes fixed upon her—and turning her head a little toward Rostóv, she\r\n      paused.\n“Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...” the wolf seemed to say to\r\n      herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a\r\n      quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.\n“Ulyulyu!”cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own accord\r\n      his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies to head off\r\n      the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still. Nicholas did\r\n      not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor see the borzois,\r\n      nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the wolf, who, increasing\r\n      her speed, bounded on in the same direction along the hollow. The first to\r\n      come into view was Mílka, with her black markings and powerful quarters,\r\n      gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and nearer... now she was ahead of it; but\r\n      the wolf turned its head to face her, and instead of putting on speed as\r\n      she usually did Mílka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.\n“Ulyulyulyulyu!”shouted Nicholas.\nThe reddish Lyubím rushed forward from behind Mílka, sprang impetuously at\r\n      the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but immediately jumped aside\r\n      in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her teeth, and again rose and\r\n      bounded forward, followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all the\r\n      borzois, who did not get any closer to her.\n“She’ll get away! No, it’s impossible!” thought Nicholas,\r\n      still shouting with a hoarse voice.\n“Karáy,ulyulyu!...” he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi\r\n      who was now his only hope. Karáy, with all the strength age had left him,\r\n      stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped heavily\r\n      aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolf’s lope and the\r\n      borzoi’s slower pace made it plain that Karáy had miscalculated. Nicholas\r\n      could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would\r\n      certainly escape should she reach it. But, coming toward him, he saw\r\n      hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf. There was\r\n      still hope. A long, yellowish young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know,\r\n      from another leash, rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and\r\n      almost knocked her over. But the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone\r\n      could have expected and, gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi,\r\n      which, with a piercing yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding\r\n      from a gash in its side.\n“Karáy? Old fellow!...” wailed Nicholas.\nThanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf’s path, the old\r\n      dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of\r\n      it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on Karáy, tucked\r\n      her tail yet further between her legs, and increased her speed. But here\r\n      Nicholas only saw that something happened to Karáy—the borzoi was\r\n      suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together down into a gully just in\r\n      front of them.\nThat instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the\r\n      dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched\r\n      hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears laid back (Karáy\r\n      was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest moment of his life. With\r\n      his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf,\r\n      when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs, and\r\n      then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully. She clicked her teeth\r\n      (Karáy no longer had her by the throat), leaped with a movement of her\r\n      hind legs out of the gully, and having disengaged herself from the dogs,\r\n      with tail tucked in again, went forward. Karáy, his hair bristling, and\r\n      probably bruised or wounded, climbed with difficulty out of the gully.\n“Oh my God! Why?” Nicholas cried in despair.\n“Uncle’s” huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolf’s\r\n      path and his borzois once more stopped the animal’s advance. She was again\r\n      hemmed in.\nNicholas and his attendant, with “Uncle” and his huntsman, were all riding\r\n      round the wolf, crying“ulyulyu!”shouting and preparing to dismount each\r\n      moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward again every time\r\n      she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she would be safe.\nAlready, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing,\r\n      had rushed out from the wood. He saw Karáy seize the wolf, and checked his\r\n      horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the horsemen\r\n      did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for safety,\r\n      Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight toward the\r\n      wood, just as Karáy had run to cut the animal off. As a result of this, he\r\n      galloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by\r\n      “Uncle’s” borzois.\nDaniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and\r\n      thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it\r\n      were a flail.\nNicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing\r\n      heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel\r\n      lying on the wolf’s back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the ears.\r\n      It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself that all\r\n      was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and tried to rise,\r\n      but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took a step, and with\r\n      his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her\r\n      by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but Daniel whispered, “Don’t!\r\n      We’ll gag her!” and, changing his position, set his foot on the wolf’s\r\n      neck. A stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a\r\n      leash, as if bridled, her legs were bound together, and Daniel rolled her\r\n      over once or twice from side to side.\nWith happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying\r\n      and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her\r\n      to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of the\r\n      cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with their booty and\r\n      their stories, and all came to look at the wolf, which, with her\r\n      broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws,\r\n      gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding\r\n      her. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly yet\r\n      simply at everybody. Old Count Rostóv also rode up and touched the wolf.\n“Oh, what a formidable one!” said he. “A formidable one, eh?” he asked\r\n      Daniel, who was standing near.\n“Yes, your excellency,” answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.\nThe count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with\r\n      Daniel.\n“Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!” said the count.\nFor sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable smile."

    "text": "The old count went home, and Natásha and Pétya promised to return very\r\n      soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday they put\r\n      the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees. Nicholas\r\n      standing in a fallow field could see all his whips.\nFacing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone\r\n      in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed\r\n      before Nicholas heard one he knew, Voltórn, giving tongue at intervals;\r\n      other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A moment\r\n      later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been found, and\r\n      the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine toward the\r\n      ryefield and away from Nicholas.\nHe saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine,\r\n      he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself at any\r\n      moment on the ryefield opposite.\nThe huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and\r\n      Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard\r\n      across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close to\r\n      the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper\r\n      curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in\r\n      followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois\r\n      formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails\r\n      turned away from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up to the\r\n      dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.\n“What’s this?” thought Nicholas. “Where’s that huntsman from? He is not\r\n      ‘Uncle’s’ man.”\nThe huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping\r\n      it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high saddles, stood near\r\n      them and there too the dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their arms and\r\n      did something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound of a horn,\r\n      with the signal agreed on in case of a fight.\n“That’s Ilágin’s huntsman having a row with our Iván,” said Nicholas’\r\n      groom.\nNicholas sent the man to call Natásha and Pétya to him, and rode at a\r\n      footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.\r\n      Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.\nNicholas dismounted, and with Natásha and Pétya, who had ridden up,\r\n      stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would end. Out of\r\n      the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his\r\n      young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still at a distance\r\n      he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was pale and\r\n      breathless and his face was angry. One of his eyes was black, but he\r\n      probably was not even aware of it.\n“What has happened?” asked Nicholas.\n“A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my gray\r\n      bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the fox! I gave\r\n      him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste of\r\n      this?...” said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably imagining\r\n      himself still speaking to his foe.\nNicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and Pétya to\r\n      wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy’s, Ilágin’s, hunting\r\n      party was.\nThe victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there, surrounded\r\n      by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.\nThe facts were that Ilágin, with whom the Rostóvs had a quarrel and were\r\n      at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rostóvs, and had\r\n      now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the Rostóvs were\r\n      hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased.\nNicholas, though he had never seen Ilágin, with his usual absence of\r\n      moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his\r\n      arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He rode\r\n      in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully prepared\r\n      to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his enemy.\nHardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a\r\n      beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,\r\n      accompanied by two hunt servants.\nInstead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilágin a stately and courteous\r\n      gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count’s\r\n      acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilágin raised his beaver cap\r\n      and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man\r\n      punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else’s\r\n      borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited\r\n      him to draw his covert.\nNatásha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had followed\r\n      him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly greetings,\r\n      she rode up to them. Ilágin lifted his beaver cap still higher to Natásha\r\n      and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young countess resembled Diana\r\n      in her passion for the chase as well as in her beauty, of which he had\r\n      heard much.\nTo expiate his huntsman’s offense, Ilágin pressed the Rostóvs to come to\r\n      an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and\r\n      which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and the hunt, now\r\n      doubled, moved on.\nThe way to Iligin’s upland was across the fields. The hunt servants fell\r\n      into line. The masters rode together. “Uncle,” Rostóv, and Ilágin kept\r\n      stealthily glancing at one another’s dogs, trying not to be observed by\r\n      their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois.\nRostóv was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred,\r\n      red-spotted bitch on Ilágin’s leash, slender but with muscles like steel,\r\n      a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of the swiftness\r\n      of Ilágin’s borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own\r\n      Mílka.\nIn the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilágin about the year’s\r\n      harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.\n“A fine little bitch, that!” said he in a careless tone. “Is she swift?”\n“That one? Yes, she’s a good dog, gets what she’s after,” answered Ilágin\r\n      indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erzá, for which, a year before, he\r\n      had given a neighbor three families of house serfs. “So in your parts,\r\n      too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?” he went on, continuing\r\n      the conversation they had begun. And considering it polite to return the\r\n      young count’s compliment, Ilágin looked at his borzois and picked out\r\n      Mílka who attracted his attention by her breadth. “That black-spotted one\r\n      of yours is fine—well shaped!” said he.\n“Yes, she’s fast enough,” replied Nicholas, and thought: “If only a\r\n      full-grown hare would cross the field now I’d show you what sort of borzoi\r\n      she is,” and turning to his groom, he said he would give a ruble to anyone\r\n      who found a hare.\n“I don’t understand,” continued Ilágin, “how some sportsmen can be so\r\n      jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count, I enjoy\r\n      riding in company such as this... what could be better?” (he again raised\r\n      his cap to Natásha) “but as for counting skins and what one takes, I don’t\r\n      care about that.”\n“Of course not!”\n“Or being upset because someone else’s borzoi and not mine catches\r\n      something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so,\r\n      Count? For I consider that...”\n“A-tu!”came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in, who had\r\n      halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip aloft, and\r\n      again repeated his long-drawn cry,“A-tu!”(This call and the uplifted\r\n      whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)\n“Ah, he has found one, I think,” said Ilágin carelessly. “Yes, we must\r\n      ride up.... Shall we both course it?” answered Nicholas, seeing in Erzá\r\n      and “Uncle’s” red Rugáy two rivals he had never yet had a chance of\r\n      pitting against his own borzois. “And suppose they outdo my Mílka at\r\n      once!” he thought as he rode with “Uncle” and Ilágin toward the hare.\n“A full-grown one?” asked Ilágin as he approached the whip who had sighted\r\n      the hare—and not without agitation he looked round and whistled to\r\n      Erzá.\n“And you, Michael Nikanórovich?” he said, addressing “Uncle.”\nThe latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.\n“How can I join in? Why, you’ve given a village for each of your borzois!\r\n      That’s it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours against one\r\n      another, you two, and I’ll look on!”\n“Rugáy, hey, hey!” he shouted. “Rugáyushka!” he added, involuntarily by\r\n      this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this\r\n      red borzoi. Natásha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and her\r\n      brother were trying to conceal, and was herself excited by it.\nThe huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the\r\n      gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off on\r\n      the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the\r\n      gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately.\n“How is it pointing?” asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward the\r\n      whip who had sighted the hare.\nBut before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming next\r\n      morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed\r\n      downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that\r\n      were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt, who\r\n      had been moving slowly, shouted, “Stop!” calling in the hounds, while the\r\n      borzoi whips, with a cry of“A-tu!”galloped across the field setting the\r\n      borzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilágin, Nicholas, Natásha, and “Uncle”\r\n       flew, reckless of where and how they went, seeing only the borzois and the\r\n      hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase. The\r\n      hare they had started was a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did\r\n      not run at once, but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and\r\n      trampling that resounded from all sides at once. He took a dozen bounds,\r\n      not very quickly, letting the borzois gain on him, and, finally having\r\n      chosen his direction and realized his danger, laid back his ears and\r\n      rushed off headlong. He had been lying in the stubble, but in front of him\r\n      was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft. The two borzois of the\r\n      huntsman who had sighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to\r\n      see and pursue him, but they had not gone far before Ilágin’s red-spotted\r\n      Erzá passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible\r\n      swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, rolled\r\n      over like a ball. The hare arched his back and bounded off yet more\r\n      swiftly. From behind Erzá rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted Mílka\r\n      and began rapidly gaining on the hare.\n“Miláshka, dear!” rose Nicholas’ triumphant cry. It looked as if Mílka\r\n      would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and flew past.\r\n      The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erzá reached him, but when\r\n      close to the hare’s scut paused as if measuring the distance, so as not to\r\n      make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg.\n“Erzá, darling!” Ilágin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erzá did not\r\n      hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have seized her\r\n      prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and\r\n      the stubble. Again Erzá and Mílka were abreast, running like a pair of\r\n      carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but it was easier for the\r\n      hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly.\n“Rugáy, Rugáyushka! That’s it, come on!” came a third voice just then, and\r\n      “Uncle’s” red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught up with the\r\n      two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible\r\n      strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off the balk onto the\r\n      ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously, sinking to his knees in\r\n      the muddy field, and all one could see was how, muddying his back, he\r\n      rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois surrounded him. A moment\r\n      later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs. Only the delighted\r\n      “Uncle” dismounted, and cut off a pad, shaking the hare for the blood to\r\n      drip off, and anxiously glancing round with restless eyes while his arms\r\n      and legs twitched. He spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about.\r\n      “That’s it, come on! That’s a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the\r\n      thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois. That’s it, come on!” said\r\n      he, panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone,\r\n      as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him, and only now had he\r\n      at last succeeded in justifying himself. “There are your thousand-ruble\r\n      ones.... That’s it, come on!...”\n“Rugáy, here’s a pad for you!” he said, throwing down the hare’s muddy\r\n      pad. “You’ve deserved it, that’s it, come on!”\n“She’d tired herself out, she’d run it down three times by herself,” said\r\n      Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he were\r\n      heard or not.\n“But what is there in running across it like that?” said Ilágin’s groom.\n“Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take it,”\r\n       Ilágin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop and his\r\n      excitement. At the same moment Natásha, without drawing breath, screamed\r\n      joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set everyone’s ear\r\n      tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all\r\n      talking at once, and it was so strange that she must herself have been\r\n      ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it at\r\n      any other time. “Uncle” himself twisted up the hare, threw it neatly and\r\n      smartly across his horse’s back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke\r\n      everybody, and, with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his\r\n      bay and rode off. The others all followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and\r\n      only much later were they able to regain their former affectation of\r\n      indifference. For a long time they continued to look at red Rugáy who, his\r\n      arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked\r\n      along just behind “Uncle’s” horse with the serene air of a conqueror.\n“Well, I am like any other dog as long as it’s not a question of coursing.\r\n      But when it is, then look out!” his appearance seemed to Nicholas to be\r\n      saying.\nWhen, much later, “Uncle” rode up to Nicholas and began talking to him, he\r\n      felt flattered that, after what had happened, “Uncle” deigned to speak to\r\n      him."

    "text": "Toward evening Ilágin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they were so\r\n      far from home that he accepted “Uncle’s” offer that the hunting party\r\n      should spend the night in his little village of Mikháylovna.\n“And if you put up at my house that will be better still. That’s it, come\r\n      on!” said “Uncle.” “You see it’s damp weather, and you could rest, and the\r\n      little countess could be driven home in a trap.”\n“Uncle’s” offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otrádnoe for a trap,\r\n      while Nicholas rode with Natásha and Pétya to “Uncle’s” house.\nSome five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front\r\n      porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as well\r\n      as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the\r\n      hunters who were arriving. The presence of Natásha—a woman, a lady,\r\n      and on horseback—raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree\r\n      that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and unabashed by\r\n      her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on\r\n      show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about\r\n      her.\n“Arínka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt dangles....\r\n      See, she’s got a little hunting horn!”\n“Goodness gracious! See her knife?...”\n“Isn’t she a Tartar!”\n“How is it you didn’t go head over heels?” asked the boldest of all,\r\n      addressing Natásha directly.\n“Uncle” dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood in\r\n      the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his retainers,\r\n      shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves\r\n      off and that all necessary preparations should be made to receive the\r\n      guests and the visitors.\nThe serfs all dispersed. “Uncle” lifted Natásha off her horse and taking\r\n      her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The house, with\r\n      its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean—it did not seem\r\n      that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless—but neither was\r\n      it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of fresh apples,\r\n      and wolf and fox skins hung about.\n“Uncle” led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a\r\n      folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round\r\n      birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where there\r\n      was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suvórov, of the\r\n      host’s father and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The study\r\n      smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. “Uncle” asked his visitors to sit down\r\n      and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room. Rugáy, his\r\n      back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on the sofa, cleaning\r\n      himself with his tongue and teeth. Leading from the study was a passage in\r\n      which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen. From behind this\r\n      came women’s laughter and whispers. Natásha, Nicholas, and Pétya took off\r\n      their wraps and sat down on the sofa. Pétya, leaning on his elbow, fell\r\n      asleep at once. Natásha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces glowed, they\r\n      were hungry and very cheerful. They looked at one another (now that the\r\n      hunt was over and they were in the house, Nicholas no longer considered it\r\n      necessary to show his manly superiority over his sister), Natásha gave him\r\n      a wink, and neither refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing\r\n      laughter even before they had a pretext ready to account for it.\nAfter a while “Uncle” came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and small\r\n      top boots. And Natásha felt that this costume, the very one she had\r\n      regarded with surprise and amusement at Otrádnoe, was just the right thing\r\n      and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat. “Uncle” too was in\r\n      high spirits and far from being offended by the brother’s and sister’s\r\n      laughter (it could never enter his head that they might be laughing at his\r\n      way of life) he himself joined in the merriment.\n“That’s right, young countess, that’s it, come on! I never saw anyone like\r\n      her!” said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem and, with a\r\n      practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that had been cut\r\n      short. “She’s ridden all day like a man, and is as fresh as ever!”\nSoon after “Uncle’s” reappearance the door was opened, evidently from the\r\n      sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking woman of about\r\n      forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered carrying a large\r\n      loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance and in\r\n      every motion, she looked at the visitors and, with a pleasant smile, bowed\r\n      respectfully. In spite of her exceptional stoutness, which caused her to\r\n      protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head, this woman (who\r\n      was “Uncle’s” housekeeper) trod very lightly. She went to the table, set\r\n      down the tray, and with her plump white hands deftly took from it the\r\n      bottles and various hors d’oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the\r\n      table. When she had finished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door\r\n      with a smile on her face. “Here I am. I am she! Now do you understand\r\n      ‘Uncle’?” her expression said to Rostóv. How could one help understanding?\r\n      Not only Nicholas, but even Natásha understood the meaning of his puckered\r\n      brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when\r\n      Anísya Fëdorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb wine, different\r\n      kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with buttermilk, honey\r\n      in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead, apples, nuts (raw and\r\n      roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards she brought a freshly\r\n      roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey, and preserves made with\r\n      sugar.\nAll this was the fruit of Anísya Fëdorovna’s housekeeping, gathered and\r\n      prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a smack of Anísya\r\n      Fëdorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness, whiteness, and\r\n      pleasant smiles.\n“Take this, little Lady-Countess!” she kept saying, as she offered Natásha\r\n      first one thing and then another.\nNatásha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such\r\n      buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such a\r\n      chicken anywhere. Anísya Fëdorovna left the room.\nAfter supper, over their cherry brandy, Rostóv and “Uncle” talked of past\r\n      and future hunts, of Rugáy and Ilágin’s dogs, while Natásha sat upright on\r\n      the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried several times to wake\r\n      Pétya that he might eat something, but he only muttered incoherent words\r\n      without waking up. Natásha felt so lighthearted and happy in these novel\r\n      surroundings that she only feared the trap would come for her too soon.\r\n      After a casual pause, such as often occurs when receiving friends for the\r\n      first time in one’s own house, “Uncle,” answering a thought that was in\r\n      his visitors’ minds, said:\n“This, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come. That’s\r\n      it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?”\n“Uncle’s” face was very significant and even handsome as he said this.\r\n      Involuntarily Rostóv recalled all the good he had heard about him from his\r\n      father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province “Uncle” had the\r\n      reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks. They\r\n      called him in to decide family disputes, chose him as executor, confided\r\n      secrets to him, elected him to be a justice and to other posts; but he\r\n      always persistently refused public appointments, passing the autumn and\r\n      spring in the fields on his bay gelding, sitting at home in winter, and\r\n      lying in his overgrown garden in summer.\n“Why don’t you enter the service, Uncle?”\n“I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That’s it, come on! I\r\n      can’t make head or tail of it. That’s for you—I haven’t brains\r\n      enough. Now, hunting is another matter—that’s it, come on! Open the\r\n      door, there!” he shouted. “Why have you shut it?”\nThe door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen’s room, as they\r\n      called the room for the hunt servants.\nThere was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the door\r\n      into the huntsmen’s room, from which came the clear sounds of a balaláyka\r\n      on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was playing.\r\n      Natásha had been listening to those strains for some time and now went out\r\n      into the passage to hear better.\n“That’s Mítka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balaláyka. I’m fond\r\n      of it,” said “Uncle.”\nIt was the custom for Mítka to play the balaláyka in the huntsmen’s room\r\n      when “Uncle” returned from the chase. “Uncle” was fond of such music.\n“How good! Really very good!” said Nicholas with some unintentional\r\n      superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him\r\n      very much.\n“Very good?” said Natásha reproachfully, noticing her brother’s tone. “Not\r\n      ‘very good’—it’s simply delicious!”\nJust as “Uncle’s” pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had seemed\r\n      to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that moment, seemed to\r\n      her the acme of musical delight.\n“More, please, more!” cried Natásha at the door as soon as the balaláyka\r\n      ceased. Mítka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the balaláyka to\r\n      the air ofMy Lady, with trills and variations. “Uncle” sat listening,\r\n      slightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air was repeated a\r\n      hundred times. The balaláyka was retuned several times and the same notes\r\n      were thrummed again, but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished\r\n      to hear it again and again. Anísya Fëdorovna came in and leaned her portly\r\n      person against the doorpost.\n“You like listening?” she said to Natásha, with a smile extremely like\r\n      “Uncle’s.” “That’s a good player of ours,” she added.\n“He doesn’t play that part right!” said “Uncle” suddenly, with an\r\n      energetic gesture. “Here he ought to burst out—that’s it, come on!—ought\r\n      to burst out.”\n“Do you play then?” asked Natásha.\n“Uncle” did not answer, but smiled.\n“Anísya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I haven’t\r\n      touched it for a long time. That’s it—come on! I’ve given it up.”\nAnísya Fëdorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her\r\n      errand and brought back the guitar.\nWithout looking at anyone, “Uncle” blew the dust off it and, tapping the\r\n      case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself in his\r\n      armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching his\r\n      left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at Anísya\r\n      Fëdorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then quietly,\r\n      smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, notMy Lady,\r\n      but the well-known song:Came a maiden down the street. The tune, played\r\n      with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the hearts of\r\n      Nicholas and Natásha, arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as\r\n      radiated from Anísya Fëdorovna’s whole being. Anísya Fëdorovna flushed,\r\n      and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the room.\r\n      “Uncle” continued to play correctly, carefully, with energetic firmness,\r\n      looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where Anísya\r\n      Fëdorovna had just stood. Something seemed to be laughing a little on one\r\n      side of his face under his gray mustaches, especially as the song grew\r\n      brisker and the time quicker and when, here and there, as he ran his\r\n      fingers over the strings, something seemed to snap.\n“Lovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!” shouted Natásha as soon as he had\r\n      finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. “Nicholas, Nicholas!”\r\n       she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: “What is it moves me\r\n      so?”\nNicholas too was greatly pleased by “Uncle’s” playing, and “Uncle” played\r\n      the piece over again. Anísya Fëdorovna’s smiling face reappeared in the\r\n      doorway and behind hers other faces...\nFetching water clear and sweet,Stop, dear maiden, I entreat—\nplayed “Uncle” once more, running his fingers skillfully over the strings,\r\n      and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.\n“Go on, Uncle dear,” Natásha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life\r\n      depended on it.\n“Uncle” rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of them\r\n      smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck a\r\n      naïve and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.\n“Now then, niece!” he exclaimed, waving to Natásha the hand that had just\r\n      struck a chord.\nNatásha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to face\r\n      “Uncle,” and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her shoulders\r\n      and struck an attitude.\nWhere, how, and when had this young countess, educated by anémigréeFrench governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit\r\n      and obtained that manner which thepas de châle* would, one would have\r\n      supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were\r\n      those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that “Uncle” had expected of\r\n      her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and smiled triumphantly, proudly,\r\n      and with sly merriment, the fear that had at first seized Nicholas and the\r\n      others that she might not do the right thing was at an end, and they were\r\n      already admiring her.\n* The French shawl dance.\nShe did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision, that\r\n      Anísya Fëdorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she needed\r\n      for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she watched\r\n      this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so different\r\n      from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was in Anísya and in\r\n      Anísya’s father and mother and aunt, and in every Russian man and woman.\n“Well, little countess; that’s it—come on!” cried “Uncle,” with a\r\n      joyous laugh, having finished the dance. “Well done, niece! Now a fine\r\n      young fellow must be found as husband for you. That’s it—come on!”\n“He’s chosen already,” said Nicholas smiling.\n“Oh?” said “Uncle” in surprise, looking inquiringly at Natásha, who nodded\r\n      her head with a happy smile.\n“And such a one!” she said. But as soon as she had said it a new train of\r\n      thoughts and feelings arose in her. “What did Nicholas’ smile mean when he\r\n      said ‘chosen already’? Is he glad of it or not? It is as if he thought my\r\n      Bolkónski would not approve of or understand our gaiety. But he would\r\n      understand it all. Where is he now?” she thought, and her face suddenly\r\n      became serious. But this lasted only a second. “Don’t dare to think about\r\n      it,” she said to herself, and sat down again smilingly beside “Uncle,”\r\n       begging him to play something more.\n“Uncle” played another song and a valse; then after a pause he cleared his\r\n      throat and sang his favorite hunting song:\nAs ‘twas growing dark last nightFell the snow so soft and light...\n“Uncle” sang as peasants sing, with full and naïve conviction that the\r\n      whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of\r\n      itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists only\r\n      to give measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered tune,\r\n      like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. Natásha was in\r\n      ecstasies over “Uncle’s” singing. She resolved to give up learning the\r\n      harp and to play only the guitar. She asked “Uncle” for his guitar and at\r\n      once found the chords of the song.\nAfter nine o’clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent to\r\n      look for them, arrived to fetch Natásha and Pétya. The count and countess\r\n      did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of the men.\nPétya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps.\r\n      Natásha and Nicholas got into the other. “Uncle” wrapped Natásha up warmly\r\n      and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness. He accompanied them on\r\n      foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed, so that they had to\r\n      go round by the ford, and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns.\n“Good-by, dear niece,” his voice called out of the darkness—not the\r\n      voice Natásha had known previously, but the one that had sungAs ‘twas\r\n      growing dark last night.\nIn the village through which they passed there were red lights and a\r\n      cheerful smell of smoke.\n“What a darling Uncle is!” said Natásha, when they had come out onto the\r\n      highroad.\n“Yes,” returned Nicholas. “You’re not cold?”\n“No. I’m quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!” answered Natásha,\r\n      almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long while. The\r\n      night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but only heard\r\n      them splashing through the unseen mud.\nWhat was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught\r\n      and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did they all find\r\n      place in her? But she was very happy. As they were nearing home she\r\n      suddenly struck up the air ofAs ‘twas growing dark last\r\n      night—the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had\r\n      at last caught.\n“Got it?” said Nicholas.\n“What were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?” inquired Natásha.\nThey were fond of asking one another that question.\n“I?” said Nicholas, trying to remember. “Well, you see, first I thought\r\n      that Rugáy, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were a man he\r\n      would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then for his\r\n      manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don’t you think so?... Well, and\r\n      you?”\n“I? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving along\r\n      and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows where we are\r\n      really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and suddenly find\r\n      that we are not in Otrádnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I thought... No,\r\n      nothing else.”\n“I know, I expect you thought of him,” said Nicholas, smiling as Natásha\r\n      knew by the sound of his voice.\n“No,” said Natásha, though she had in reality been thinking about Prince\r\n      Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would have liked\r\n      “Uncle.” “And then I was saying to myself all the way, ‘How well Anísya\r\n      carried herself, how well!’” And Nicholas heard her spontaneous, happy,\r\n      ringing laughter. “And do you know,” she suddenly said, “I know that I\r\n      shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now.”\n“Rubbish, nonsense, humbug!” exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought: “How\r\n      charming this Natásha of mine is! I have no other friend like her and\r\n      never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive about\r\n      together!”\n“What a darling this Nicholas of mine is!” thought Natásha.\n“Ah, there are still lights in the drawing room!” she said, pointing to\r\n      the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety\r\n      darkness of the night."

    "text": "Count Ilyá Rostóv had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility\r\n      because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs did not\r\n      improve. Natásha and Nicholas often noticed their parents conferring\r\n      together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the fine\r\n      ancestral Rostóv house and estate near Moscow. It was not necessary to\r\n      entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal, and life at\r\n      Otrádnoe was quieter than in former years, but still the enormous house\r\n      and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to table\r\n      every day. These were all their own people who had settled down in the\r\n      house almost as members of the family, or persons who were, it seemed,\r\n      obliged to live in the count’s house. Such were Dimmler the musician and\r\n      his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his family, Belóva, an old maiden\r\n      lady, an inmate of the house, and many others such as Pétya’s tutors, the\r\n      girls’ former governess, and other people who simply found it preferable\r\n      and more advantageous to live in the count’s house than at home. They had\r\n      not as many visitors as before, but the old habits of life without which\r\n      the count and countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged.\r\n      There was still the hunting establishment which Nicholas had even\r\n      enlarged, the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, the\r\n      same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name\r\n      days; there were still the count’s games of whist and boston, at which—spreading\r\n      out his cards so that everybody could see them—he let himself be\r\n      plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors, who looked\r\n      upon an opportunity to play a rubber with Count Rostóv as a most\r\n      profitable source of income.\nThe count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to believe\r\n      that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step, and\r\n      feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and\r\n      patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her loving heart, felt\r\n      that her children were being ruined, that it was not the count’s fault for\r\n      he could not help being what he was—that (though he tried to hide\r\n      it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his\r\n      children’s ruin, and she tried to find means of remedying the position.\r\n      From her feminine point of view she could see only one solution, namely,\r\n      for Nicholas to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to be their last hope\r\n      and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found for him, she would\r\n      have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right. This match was\r\n      with Julie Karágina, the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents, a\r\n      girl the Rostóvs had known from childhood, and who had now become a\r\n      wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers.\nThe countess had written direct to Julie’s mother in Moscow suggesting a\r\n      marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from\r\n      her. Karágina had replied that for her part she was agreeable, and\r\n      everything depend on her daughter’s inclination. She invited Nicholas to\r\n      come to Moscow.\nSeveral times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son that now\r\n      both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him married. She\r\n      said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that were accomplished.\r\n      Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl and tried to discover\r\n      what he thought about marriage.\nAt other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to Moscow\r\n      during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his mother’s\r\n      remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced her\r\n      to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope of getting their\r\n      affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie Karágina.\n“But, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would you expect\r\n      me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money?” he asked\r\n      his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question and only wishing to\r\n      show his noble-mindedness.\n“No, you have not understood me,” said his mother, not knowing how to\r\n      justify herself. “You have not understood me, Nikólenka. It is your\r\n      happiness I wish for,” she added, feeling that she was telling an untruth\r\n      and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.\n“Mamma, don’t cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I will give\r\n      my life, anything, to put you at ease,” said Nicholas. “I would sacrifice\r\n      anything for you—even my feelings.”\nBut the countess did not want the question put like that: she did not want\r\n      a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice for him.\n“No, you have not understood me, don’t let us talk about it,” she replied,\r\n      wiping away her tears.\n“Maybe I do love a poor girl,” said Nicholas to himself. “Am I to\r\n      sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could\r\n      speak so to me. Because Sónya is poor I must not love her,” he thought,\r\n      “must not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should certainly be\r\n      happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can always sacrifice my\r\n      feelings for my family’s welfare,” he said to himself, “but I can’t coerce\r\n      my feelings. If I love Sónya, that feeling is for me stronger and higher\r\n      than all else.”\nNicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the\r\n      conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and sometimes\r\n      with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and\r\n      the portionless Sónya. Though she blamed herself for it, she could not\r\n      refrain from grumbling at and worrying Sónya, often pulling her up without\r\n      reason, addressing her stiffly as “my dear,” and using the formal “you”\r\n       instead of the intimate “thou” in speaking to her. The kindhearted\r\n      countess was the more vexed with Sónya because that poor, dark-eyed niece\r\n      of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly grateful to her benefactors,\r\n      and so faithfully, unchangingly, and unselfishly in love with Nicholas,\r\n      that there were no grounds for finding fault with her.\nNicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter had\r\n      come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he would have\r\n      been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly\r\n      reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to defer his return till\r\n      the beginning of the new year. Natásha was still as much in love with her\r\n      betrothed, found the same comfort in that love, and was still as ready to\r\n      throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at the end of\r\n      the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits of depression\r\n      which she could not master. She felt sorry for herself: sorry that she was\r\n      being wasted all this time and of no use to anyone—while she felt\r\n      herself so capable of loving and being loved.\nThings were not cheerful in the Rostóvs’ home."

    "text": "Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and\r\n      wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and the\r\n      new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities, though the\r\n      calm frost of twenty degrees Réaumur, the dazzling sunshine by day, and\r\n      the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special\r\n      celebration of the season.\nOn the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the\r\n      inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest time\r\n      of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that morning,\r\n      was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was resting in his\r\n      study. Sónya sat in the drawing room at the round table, copying a design\r\n      for embroidery. The countess was playing patience. Nastásya Ivánovna the\r\n      buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old ladies. Natásha\r\n      came into the room, went up to Sónya, glanced at what she was doing, and\r\n      then went up to her mother and stood without speaking.\n“Why are you wandering about like an outcast?” asked her mother. “What do\r\n      you want?”\n“Him... I want him... now, this minute! I wanthim!”\r\n      said Natásha, with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.\nThe countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.\n“Don’t look at me, Mamma! Don’t look; I shall cry directly.”\n“Sit down with me a little,” said the countess.\n“Mamma, I wanthim. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?”\nHer voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned quickly to\r\n      hide them and left the room.\nShe passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then\r\n      went into the maids’ room. There an old maidservant was grumbling at a\r\n      young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold from the\r\n      serfs’ quarters.\n“Stop playing—there’s a time for everything,” said the old woman.\n“Let her alone, Kondrátevna,” said Natásha. “Go, Mavrúshka, go.”\nHaving released Mavrúshka, Natásha crossed the dancing hall and went to\r\n      the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing cards.\r\n      They broke off and rose as she entered.\n“What can I do with them?” thought Natásha.\n“Oh, Nikíta, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the yard and\r\n      fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some oats.”\n“Just a few oats?” said Misha, cheerfully and readily.\n“Go, go quickly,” the old man urged him.\n“And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.”\nOn her way past the butler’s pantry she told them to set a samovar, though\r\n      it was not at all the time for tea.\nFóka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house. Natásha\r\n      liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and asked\r\n      whether the samovar was really wanted.\n“Oh dear, what a young lady!” said Fóka, pretending to frown at Natásha.\nNo one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as\r\n      Natásha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send them\r\n      on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of them would get\r\n      angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no one’s orders so\r\n      readily as they did hers. “What can I do, where can I go?” thought she, as\r\n      she went slowly along the passage.\n“Nastásya Ivánovna, what sort of children shall I have?” she asked the\r\n      buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman’s jacket.\n“Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,” answered the buffoon.\n“O Lord, O Lord, it’s always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What am I to\r\n      do with myself?” And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly upstairs to\r\n      see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.\nTwo governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were\r\n      plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were discussing\r\n      whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Natásha sat down,\r\n      listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air, and then got up\r\n      again.\n“The island of Madagascar,” she said, “Ma-da-gas-car,” she repeated,\r\n      articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame Schoss\r\n      who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the room.\nHer brother Pétya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on him he\r\n      was preparing fireworks to let off that night.\n“Pétya! Pétya!” she called to him. “Carry me downstairs.”\nPétya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her arms\r\n      round his neck, and he pranced along with her.\n“No, don’t... the island of Madagascar!” she said, and jumping off his\r\n      back she went downstairs.\nHaving as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made sure\r\n      that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dull, Natásha\r\n      betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down in a dark\r\n      corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over the strings in\r\n      the bass, picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard\r\n      in Petersburg with Prince Andrew. What she drew from the guitar would have\r\n      had no meaning for other listeners, but in her imagination a whole series\r\n      of reminiscences arose from those sounds. She sat behind the bookcase with\r\n      her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and\r\n      listened to herself and pondered. She was in a mood for brooding on the\r\n      past.\nSónya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natásha glanced at\r\n      her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that she\r\n      remembered the light falling through that crack once before and Sónya\r\n      passing with a glass in her hand. “Yes it was exactly the same,” thought\r\n      Natásha.\n“Sónya, what is this?” she cried, twanging a thick string.\n“Oh, you are there!” said Sónya with a start, and came near and listened.\r\n      “I don’t know. A storm?” she ventured timidly, afraid of being wrong.\n“There! That’s just how she started and just how she came up smiling\r\n      timidly when all this happened before,” thought Natásha, “and in just the\r\n      same way I thought there was something lacking in her.”\n“No, it’s the chorus fromThe Water-Carrier, listen!”\r\n      and Natásha sang the air of the chorus so that Sónya should catch it. “Where\r\n      were you going?” she asked.\n“To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.”\n“You always find something to do, but I can’t,” said Natásha. “And where’s\r\n      Nicholas?”\n“Asleep, I think.”\n“Sónya, go and wake him,” said Natásha. “Tell him I want him to come and\r\n      sing.”\nShe sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened\r\n      before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all regretting\r\n      not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was\r\n      withhimand he was looking at her with a lover’s eyes.\n“Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be! And,\r\n      worst of all, I am growing old—that’s the thing! There won’t then be\r\n      in me what there is now. But perhaps he’ll come today, will come\r\n      immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room.\r\n      Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.” She rose, put down the\r\n      guitar, and went to the drawing room.\nAll the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were already at\r\n      the tea table. The servants stood round the table—but Prince Andrew\r\n      was not there and life was going on as before.\n“Ah, here she is!” said the old count, when he saw Natásha enter. “Well,\r\n      sit down by me.” But Natásha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if\r\n      looking for something.\n“Mamma!” she muttered, “give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,\r\n      quickly!” and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.\nShe sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the\r\n      elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. “My God, my God! The\r\n      same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the same\r\n      way!” thought Natásha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up\r\n      in her for the whole household, because they were always the same.\nAfter tea, Nicholas, Sónya, and Natásha went to the sitting room, to their\r\n      favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began."

    "text": "“Does it ever happen to you,” said Natásha to her brother, when they\r\n      settled down in the sitting room, “does it ever happen to you to feel as\r\n      if there were nothing more to come—nothing; that everything good is\r\n      past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?”\n“I should think so!” he replied. “I have felt like that when everything\r\n      was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has come into my mind\r\n      that I was already tired of it all, and that we must all die. Once in the\r\n      regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music... and\r\n      suddenly I felt so depressed...”\n“Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!” Natásha interrupted him. “When I was\r\n      quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when I was\r\n      punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat sobbing in\r\n      the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry for\r\n      everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was innocent—that was\r\n      the chief thing,” said Natásha. “Do you remember?”\n“I remember,” answered Nicholas. “I remember that I came to you afterwards\r\n      and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt ashamed to. We were\r\n      terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you. Do\r\n      you remember?”\n“And do you remember,” Natásha asked with a pensive smile, “how once,\r\n      long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us into the study—that\r\n      was in the old house—and it was dark—we went in and suddenly\r\n      there stood...”\n“A Negro,” chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. “Of course I\r\n      remember. Even now I don’t know whether there really was a Negro, or if we\r\n      only dreamed it or were told about him.”\n“He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked at\r\n      us....”\n“Sónya, doyouremember?” asked Nicholas.\n“Yes, yes, I do remember something too,” Sónya answered timidly.\n“You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,” said Natásha,\r\n      “and they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you remember!”\n“Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.”\n“How strange it is! It’s as if it were a dream! I like that.”\n“And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom, and\r\n      suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was that real\r\n      or not? Do you remember what fun it was?”\n“Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the\r\n      porch?”\nSo they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not the sad\r\n      memories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones—those impressions of\r\n      one’s most distant past in which dreams and realities blend—and they\r\n      laughed with quiet enjoyment.\nSónya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared\r\n      the same reminiscences.\nMuch that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she recalled\r\n      did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. She simply\r\n      enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.\nShe only really took part when they recalled Sónya’s first arrival. She\r\n      told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a corded\r\n      jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too, would be sewn up with\r\n      cords.\n“And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a cabbage,”\r\n       said Natásha, “and I remember that I dared not disbelieve it then, but\r\n      knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.”\nWhile they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of the\r\n      sitting room.\n“They have brought the cock, Miss,” she said in a whisper.\n“It isn’t wanted, Pólya. Tell them to take it away,” replied Natásha.\nIn the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and went\r\n      up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth\r\n      covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.\n“Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,” came the old\r\n      countess’ voice from the drawing room.\nDimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natásha, Nicholas, and Sónya,\r\n      remarked: “How quiet you young people are!”\n“Yes, we’re philosophizing,” said Natásha, glancing round for a moment and\r\n      then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing dreams.\nDimmler began to play; Natásha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table,\r\n      took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly in\r\n      her former place. It was dark in the room especially where they were\r\n      sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of the\r\n      full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but still sat\r\n      softly running his fingers over the strings, evidently uncertain whether\r\n      to stop or to play something else.\n“Do you know,” said Natásha in a whisper, moving closer to Nicholas and\r\n      Sónya, “that when one goes on and on recalling memories, one at last\r\n      begins to remember what happened before one was in the world....”\n“That is metempsychosis,” said Sónya, who had always learned well, and\r\n      remembered everything. “The Egyptians believed that our souls have lived\r\n      in animals, and will go back into animals again.”\n“No, I don’t believe we ever were in animals,” said Natásha, still in a\r\n      whisper though the music had ceased. “But I am certain that we were angels\r\n      somewherethere, and have been here, and that is why we remember....”\n“May I join you?” said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat down by\r\n      them.\n“If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?” said Nicholas. “No,\r\n      that can’t be!”\n“Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I was before?”\r\n       Natásha rejoined with conviction. “The soul is immortal—well then,\r\n      if I shall always live I must have lived before, lived for a whole\r\n      eternity.”\n“Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,” remarked Dimmler, who\r\n      had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now spoke\r\n      as quietly and seriously as they.\n“Why is it hard to imagine eternity?” said Natásha. “It is now today, and\r\n      it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, and the day\r\n      before....”\n“Natásha! Now it’s your turn. Sing me something,” they heard the countess\r\n      say. “Why are you sitting there like conspirators?”\n“Mamma, I don’t at all want to,” replied Natásha, but all the same she\r\n      rose.\nNone of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break off their\r\n      conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but Natásha got up\r\n      and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing as usual in the middle\r\n      of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best, Natásha\r\n      began to sing her mother’s favorite song.\nShe had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had sung,\r\n      and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The count, from\r\n      his study where he was talking to Mítenka, heard her and, like a schoolboy\r\n      in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk while giving orders\r\n      to the steward, and at last stopped, while Mítenka stood in front of him\r\n      also listening and smiling. Nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister\r\n      and drew breath in time with her. Sónya, as she listened, thought of the\r\n      immense difference there was between herself and her friend, and how\r\n      impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her cousin.\r\n      The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with tears in her\r\n      eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She thought of Natásha and of her own\r\n      youth, and of how there was something unnatural and dreadful in this\r\n      impending marriage of Natásha and Prince Andrew.\nDimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with closed\r\n      eyes.\n“Ah, Countess,” he said at last, “that’s a European talent, she has\r\n      nothing to learn—what softness, tenderness, and strength....”\n“Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!” said the countess, not\r\n      realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her that\r\n      Natásha had too much of something, and that because of this she would not\r\n      be happy. Before Natásha had finished singing, fourteen-year-old Pétya\r\n      rushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers had arrived.\nNatásha stopped abruptly.\n“Idiot!” she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair, threw\r\n      herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long\r\n      time.\n“It’s nothing, Mamma, really it’s nothing; only Pétya startled me,” she\r\n      said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked\r\n      her.\nThe mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,\r\n      innkeepers, and ladies—frightening and funny—bringing in with\r\n      them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first\r\n      timidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed\r\n      into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily and\r\n      heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas games. The\r\n      countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their costumes, went\r\n      into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom, smiling radiantly\r\n      and applauding the players. The young people had disappeared.\nHalf an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the ballroom\r\n      an old lady in a hooped skirt—this was Nicholas. A Turkish girl was\r\n      Pétya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Natásha, and a Circassian was\r\n      Sónya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.\nAfter the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those\r\n      who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their\r\n      costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere.\nNicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to take\r\n      them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them about a\r\n      dozen of the serf mummers and drive to “Uncle’s.”\n“No, why disturb the old fellow?” said the countess. “Besides, you\r\n      wouldn’t have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the\r\n      Melyukóvs’.”\nMelyukóva was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and\r\n      governesses, lived three miles from the Rostóvs.\n“That’s right, my dear,” chimed in the old count, thoroughly aroused.\r\n      “I’ll dress up at once and go with them. I’ll make Pashette open her\r\n      eyes.”\nBut the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all\r\n      these last days. It was decided that the count must not go, but that if\r\n      Louisa Ivánovna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the young ladies might\r\n      go to the Melyukóvs’, Sónya, generally so timid and shy, more urgently\r\n      than anyone begging Louisa Ivánovna not to refuse.\nSónya’s costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were\r\n      extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome, and\r\n      she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some inner\r\n      voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and in her\r\n      male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa Ivánovna consented\r\n      to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells,\r\n      their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow, drove up to\r\n      the porch.\nNatásha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing from\r\n      one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all came\r\n      out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to one\r\n      another, laughing, and shouting.\nTwo of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the old\r\n      count’s with a trotter from the Orlóv stud as shaft horse, the fourth was\r\n      Nicholas’ own with a short shaggy black shaft horse. Nicholas, in his old\r\n      lady’s dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat, stood in the\r\n      middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.\nIt was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal\r\n      harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm\r\n      at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.\nNatásha, Sónya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas’ sleigh;\r\n      Dimmler, his wife, and Pétya, into the old count’s, and the rest of the\r\n      mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.\n“You go ahead, Zakhár!” shouted Nicholas to his father’s coachman, wishing\r\n      for a chance to race past him.\nThe old count’s troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,\r\n      squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its deep-toned\r\n      bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the middle\r\n      horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar, and threw\r\n      it up.\nNicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others moved\r\n      noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove at a steady trot\r\n      along the narrow road. While they drove past the garden the shadows of the\r\n      bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight, but\r\n      as soon as they were past the fence, the snowy plain bathed in moonlight\r\n      and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled\r\n      with bluish shadows.Bang, bang!went the first sleigh over a cradle hole\r\n      in the snow of the road, and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same\r\n      way, and rudely breaking the frost-bound stillness, the troykas began to\r\n      speed along the road, one after the other.\n“A hare’s track, a lot of tracks!” rang out Natásha’s voice through the\r\n      frost-bound air.\n“How light it is, Nicholas!” came Sónya’s voice.\nNicholas glanced round at Sónya, and bent down to see her face closer.\r\n      Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at him\r\n      from her sable furs—so close and yet so distant—in the\r\n      moonlight.\n“That used to be Sónya,” thought he, and looked at her closer and smiled.\n“What is it, Nicholas?”\n“Nothing,” said he and turned again to the horses.\nWhen they came out onto the beaten highroad—polished by sleigh\r\n      runners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in\r\n      the moonlight—the horses began to tug at the reins of their own\r\n      accord and increased their pace. The near side horse, arching his head and\r\n      breaking into a short canter, tugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed\r\n      from side to side, moving his ears as if asking: “Isn’t it time to begin\r\n      now?” In front, already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing\r\n      farther and farther off, the black horses driven by Zakhár could be\r\n      clearly seen against the white snow. From that sleigh one could hear the\r\n      shouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.\n“Gee up, my darlings!” shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one side and\r\n      flourishing the whip.\nIt was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the\r\n      side horses who pulled harder—ever increasing their gallop—that\r\n      one noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With\r\n      screams, squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to\r\n      gallop—the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily\r\n      beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and\r\n      ready to put on speed when required.\nNicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and coming\r\n      out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.\n“Where are we?” thought he. “It’s the Kosóy meadow, I\r\n      suppose. But no—this is something new I’ve never seen before. This\r\n      isn’t the Kosóy meadow nor the Dëmkin hill, and heaven only knows what it is!\r\n      It is something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be...” And shouting\r\n      to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.\nZakhár held back his horses and turned his face, which was already covered\r\n      with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.\nNicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakhár, stretching out his arms,\r\n      clucked his tongue and let his horses go.\n“Now, look out, master!” he cried.\nFaster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved the feet\r\n      of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead. Zakhár, while\r\n      still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the reins.\n“No you won’t, master!” he shouted.\nNicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhár. The horses\r\n      showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh—beside\r\n      them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of\r\n      swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing. The\r\n      whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls\r\n      shrieking were heard from different sides.\nAgain checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were still\r\n      surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with stars.\n“Zakhár is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the left?”\r\n       thought Nicholas. “Are we getting to the Melyukóvs’? Is this Melyukóvka?\r\n      Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows what is happening\r\n      to us—but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is.” And he\r\n      looked round in the sleigh.\n“Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!” said one of the strange,\r\n      pretty, unfamiliar people—the one with fine eyebrows and mustache.\n“I think this used to be Natásha,” thought Nicholas, “and that was Madame\r\n      Schoss, but perhaps it’s not, and this Circassian with the mustache I\r\n      don’t know, but I love her.”\n“Aren’t you cold?” he asked.\nThey did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh behind\r\n      shouted something—probably something funny—but they could not\r\n      make out what he said.\n“Yes, yes!” some voices answered, laughing.\n“But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a glitter of\r\n      diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy\r\n      buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And if this is really\r\n      Melyukóvka, it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and have\r\n      come to Melyukóvka,” thought Nicholas.\nIt really was Melyukóvka, and maids and footmen with merry faces came\r\n      running, out to the porch carrying candles.\n“Who is it?” asked someone in the porch.\n“The mummers from the count’s. I know by the horses,” replied some voices."

    "text": "Pelagéya Danílovna Melyukóva, a broadly built, energetic woman wearing\r\n      spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded by her\r\n      daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull. They were quietly\r\n      dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax figures\r\n      would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and voices of new\r\n      arrivals in the vestibule.\nHussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their throats\r\n      and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule, came into the\r\n      ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The clown—Dimmler—and\r\n      the lady—Nicholas—started a dance. Surrounded by the screaming\r\n      children the mummers, covering their faces and disguising their voices,\r\n      bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the room.\n“Dear me! there’s no recognizing them! And Natásha! See whom she looks\r\n      like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr Dimmler—isn’t he\r\n      good! I didn’t know him! And how he dances. Dear me, there’s a Circassian.\r\n      Really, how becoming it is to dear Sónya. And who is that? Well, you have\r\n      cheered us up! Nikíta and Vanya—clear away the tables! And we were\r\n      sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The hussar, the hussar! Just like a\r\n      boy! And the legs!... I can’t look at him...” different voices were\r\n      saying.\nNatásha, the young Melyukóvs’ favorite, disappeared with them into the\r\n      back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments were\r\n      called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from behind\r\n      the door. Ten minutes later, all the young Melyukóvs joined the mummers.\nPelagéya Danílovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the\r\n      visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,\r\n      went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles, peering into\r\n      their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of them.\r\n      It was not merely Dimmler and the Rostóvs she failed to recognize, she did\r\n      not even recognize her own daughters, or her late husband’s, dressing\r\n      gowns and uniforms, which they had put on.\n“And who is this?” she asked her governess, peering into the face of her\r\n      own daughter dressed up as a Kazán-Tartar. “I suppose it is one of the\r\n      Rostóvs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve in?” she asked\r\n      Natásha. “Here, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!” she ordered the butler\r\n      who was handing things round. “That’s not forbidden by his law.”\nSometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the\r\n      dancers, who—having decided once for all that being disguised, no\r\n      one would recognize them—were not at all shy, Pelagéya Danílovna hid\r\n      her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with\r\n      irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.\n“My little Sásha! Look at Sásha!” she said.\nAfter Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelagéya Danílovna made\r\n      the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string, and a\r\n      silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together.\nIn an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The corked\r\n      eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed, and\r\n      merry faces. Pelagéya Danílovna began to recognize the mummers, admired\r\n      their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they suited the\r\n      young ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained her so well.\r\n      The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room, and the serfs had\r\n      something served to them in the ballroom.\n“Now to tell one’s fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!” said an\r\n      old maid who lived with the Melyukóvs, during supper.\n“Why?” said the eldest Melyukóv girl.\n“You wouldn’t go, it takes courage....”\n“I’ll go,” said Sónya.\n“Tell what happened to the young lady!” said the second Melyukóv girl.\n“Well,” began the old maid, “a young lady once went out, took a cock, laid\r\n      the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After sitting a while, she\r\n      suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh drives up with harness bells;\r\n      she hears him coming! He comes in, just in the shape of a man, like an\r\n      officer—comes in and sits down to table with her.”\n“Ah! ah!” screamed Natásha, rolling her eyes with horror.\n“Yes? And how... did he speak?”\n“Yes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began persuading her;\r\n      and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got\r\n      frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands. Then he\r\n      caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just then....”\n“Now, why frighten them?” said Pelagéya Danílovna.\n“Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself...” said her daughter.\n“And how does one do it in a barn?” inquired Sónya.\n“Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on what you\r\n      hear; hammering and knocking—that’s bad; but a sound of shifting\r\n      grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.”\n“Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.”\nPelagéya Danílovna smiled.\n“Oh, I’ve forgotten...” she replied. “But none of you would go?”\n“Yes, I will; Pelagéya Danílovna, let me! I’ll go,” said Sónya.\n“Well, why not, if you’re not afraid?”\n“Louisa Ivánovna, may I?” asked Sónya.\nWhether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or\r\n      talking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sónya’s side, and gazed at her with\r\n      quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks to that\r\n      burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her. And really,\r\n      that evening, Sónya was brighter, more animated, and prettier than\r\n      Nicholas had ever seen her before.\n“So that’s what she is like; what a fool I have been!” he thought gazing\r\n      at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile\r\n      dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.\n“I’m not afraid of anything,” said Sónya. “May I go at once?” She got up.\nThey told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen, and\r\n      they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and shoulders\r\n      and glanced at Nicholas.\n“What a darling that girl is!” thought he. “And what have I been thinking\r\n      of till now?”\nSónya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went hastily\r\n      to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people really had\r\n      made the house stuffy.\nOutside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even\r\n      brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with\r\n      so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real\r\n      stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was\r\n      gay.\n“I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?” thought Nicholas, and\r\n      running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and along\r\n      the path that led to the back porch. He knew Sónya would pass that way.\r\n      Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and across and along them\r\n      a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the snow and on\r\n      the path. This path led to the barn. The log walls of the barn and its\r\n      snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out of some precious stone,\r\n      sparkled in the moonlight. A tree in the garden snapped with the frost,\r\n      and then all was again perfectly silent. His bosom seemed to inhale not\r\n      air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness.\nFrom the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the\r\n      bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard\r\n      the voice of an old maidservant saying, “Straight, straight, along the\r\n      path, Miss. Only, don’t look back.”\n“I am not afraid,” answered Sónya’s voice, and along the path toward\r\n      Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of Sónya’s feet in her thin\r\n      shoes.\nSónya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of paces\r\n      away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had\r\n      known and always slightly feared. He was in a woman’s dress, with tousled\r\n      hair and a happy smile new to Sónya. She ran rapidly toward him.\n“Quite different and yet the same,” thought Nicholas, looking at her face\r\n      all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak that\r\n      covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her on the\r\n      lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork. Sónya kissed him\r\n      full on the lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his\r\n      cheeks.\n“Sónya!... Nicholas!”... was all they said. They ran to the barn and then\r\n      back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back porch."

    "text": "When they all drove back from Pelagéya Danílovna’s, Natásha, who always\r\n      saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss should go\r\n      back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and Sónya with Nicholas and the maids.\nOn the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and kept\r\n      peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into Sónya’s face and\r\n      searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present\r\n      Sónya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again. He looked and\r\n      recognizing in her both the old and the new Sónya, and being reminded by\r\n      the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss, inhaled the frosty\r\n      air with a full breast and, looking at the ground flying beneath him and\r\n      at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in fairyland.\n“Sónya, is it well withthee?” he asked from time to time.\n“Yes!” she replied. “And withthee?”\nWhen halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for a\r\n      moment to Natásha’s sleigh and stood on its wing.\n“Natásha!” he whispered in French, “do you know I have made up my mind\r\n      about Sónya?”\n“Have you told her?” asked Natásha, suddenly beaming all over with joy.\n“Oh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!... Natásha—are\r\n      you glad?”\n“I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I did not\r\n      tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she has,\r\n      Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy while Sónya\r\n      was not,” continued Natásha. “Now I am so glad! Well, run back to her.”\n“No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!” cried Nicholas, peering into\r\n      her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and\r\n      bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before. “Natásha, it’s\r\n      magical, isn’t it?”\n“Yes,” she replied. “You have done splendidly.”\n“Had I seen her before as she is now,” thought Nicholas, “I should long\r\n      ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me, and all\r\n      would have been well.”\n“So you are glad and I have done right?”\n“Oh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it. Mamma\r\n      said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing! I nearly\r\n      stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of Sónya, for\r\n      there is nothing but good in her.”\n“Then it’s all right?” said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the expression of\r\n      his sister’s face to see if she was in earnest. Then he jumped down and,\r\n      his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his sleigh. The same happy,\r\n      smiling Circassian, with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a\r\n      sable hood, was still sitting there, and that Circassian was Sónya, and\r\n      that Sónya was certainly his future happy and loving wife.\nWhen they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the\r\n      evening at the Melyukóvs’, the girls went to their bedroom. When they had\r\n      undressed, but without washing off the cork mustaches, they sat a long\r\n      time talking of their happiness. They talked of how they would live when\r\n      they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how happy they\r\n      would be. On Natásha’s table stood two looking glasses which Dunyásha had\r\n      prepared beforehand.\n“Only when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too good!”\r\n       said Natásha, rising and going to the looking glasses.\n“Sit down, Natásha; perhaps you’ll see him,” said Sónya.\nNatásha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking glasses,\r\n      and sat down.\n“I see someone with a mustache,” said Natásha, seeing her own face.\n“You mustn’t laugh, Miss,” said Dunyásha.\nWith Sónya’s help and the maid’s, Natásha got the glass she held into the\r\n      right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious expression\r\n      and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the receding line of\r\n      candles reflected in the glasses and expecting (from tales she had heard)\r\n      to see a coffin, orhim, Prince Andrew, in that last dim, indistinctly\r\n      outlined square. But ready as she was to take the smallest speck for the\r\n      image of a man or of a coffin, she saw nothing. She began blinking rapidly\r\n      and moved away from the looking glasses.\n“Why is it others see things and I don’t?” she said. “You sit down now,\r\n      Sónya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I feel so\r\n      frightened!”\nSónya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began\r\n      looking.\n“Now, Miss Sónya is sure to see something,” whispered Dunyásha; “while you\r\n      do nothing but laugh.”\nSónya heard this and Natásha’s whisper:\n“I know she will. She saw something last year.”\nFor about three minutes all were silent.\n“Of course she will!” whispered Natásha, but did not finish... suddenly\r\n      Sónya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with her\r\n      hand.\n“Oh, Natásha!” she cried.\n“Did you see? Did you? What was it?” exclaimed Natásha, holding up the\r\n      looking glass.\nSónya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to get up\r\n      when she heard Natásha say, “Of course she will!” She did not wish to\r\n      disappoint either Dunyásha or Natásha, but it was hard to sit still. She\r\n      did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she\r\n      covered her eyes.\n“You saw him?” urged Natásha, seizing her hand.\n“Yes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,” Sónya could not help saying, not yet\r\n      knowing whom Natásha meant byhim, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.\n“But why shouldn’t I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who can\r\n      tell whether I saw anything or not?” flashed through Sónya’s mind.\n“Yes, I saw him,” she said.\n“How? Standing or lying?”\n“No, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying down.”\n“Andrew lying? Is he ill?” asked Natásha, her frightened eyes fixed on her\r\n      friend.\n“No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he\r\n      turned to me.” And when saying this she herself fancied she had really\r\n      seen what she described.\n“Well, and then, Sónya?...”\n“After that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and\r\n      red....”\n“Sónya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how afraid I\r\n      am for him and for myself and about everything!...” Natásha began, and\r\n      without replying to Sónya’s words of comfort she got into bed, and long\r\n      after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless, gazing at the\r\n      moonlight through the frosty windowpanes."

    "text": "Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love for\r\n      Sónya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who had long\r\n      noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration,\r\n      listened to him in silence and then told her son that he might marry whom\r\n      he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would give their blessing\r\n      to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time, felt that his mother was\r\n      displeased with him and that, despite her love for him, she would not give\r\n      way. Coldly, without looking at her son, she sent for her husband and,\r\n      when he came, tried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts, in her\r\n      son’s presence, but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of\r\n      vexation and left the room. The old count began irresolutely to admonish\r\n      Nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose. Nicholas replied that he\r\n      could not go back on his word, and his father, sighing and evidently\r\n      disconcerted, very soon became silent and went in to the countess. In all\r\n      his encounters with his son, the count was always conscious of his own\r\n      guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune, and so he could not\r\n      be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and choosing the\r\n      dowerless Sónya. On this occasion, he was only more vividly conscious of\r\n      the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder, no better wife for\r\n      Nicholas than Sónya could have been wished for, and that no one but\r\n      himself with his Mítenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the\r\n      condition of the family finances.\nThe father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again, but\r\n      a few days later the countess sent for Sónya and, with a cruelty neither\r\n      of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch Nicholas and\r\n      for ingratitude. Sónya listened silently with downcast eyes to the\r\n      countess’ cruel words, without understanding what was required of her. She\r\n      was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors. Self-sacrifice was\r\n      her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see what she ought\r\n      to sacrifice, or for whom. She could not help loving the countess and the\r\n      whole Rostóv family, but neither could she help loving Nicholas and\r\n      knowing that his happiness depended on that love. She was silent and sad\r\n      and did not reply. Nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went\r\n      to have an explanation with his mother. He first implored her to forgive\r\n      him and Sónya and consent to their marriage, then he threatened that if\r\n      she molested Sónya he would at once marry her secretly.\nThe countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her before,\r\n      replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying without his\r\n      father’s consent, and he could do the same, but that she would never\r\n      receive thatintrigueras her daughter.\nExploding at the wordintriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told his\r\n      mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his feelings,\r\n      but if that were so, he would say for the last time.... But he had no time\r\n      to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face caused his\r\n      mother to await with terror, and which would perhaps have forever remained\r\n      a cruel memory to them both. He had not time to say it, for Natásha, with\r\n      a pale and set face, entered the room from the door at which she had been\r\n      listening.\n“Nicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I tell\r\n      you!...” she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.\n“Mamma darling, it’s not at all so... my poor, sweet darling,” she said to\r\n      her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of a rupture\r\n      gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and excitement of the\r\n      conflict could not and would not give way.\n“Nicholas, I’ll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,” said\r\n      Natásha.\nHer words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which she was\r\n      aiming.\nThe countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter’s breast,\r\n      while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.\nNatásha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded that\r\n      Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Sónya should not be\r\n      troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything without\r\n      his parents’ knowledge.\nFirmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment, to\r\n      retire from the army and return and marry Sónya, Nicholas, serious,\r\n      sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,\r\n      passionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his\r\n      regiment.\nAfter Nicholas had gone things in the Rostóv household were more\r\n      depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.\nSónya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on\r\n      account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward\r\n      her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his\r\n      affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house and\r\n      estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they had to go\r\n      to Moscow. But the countess’ health obliged them to delay their departure\r\n      from day to day.\nNatásha, who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed\r\n      lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and impatient every\r\n      day. The thought that her best days, which she would have employed in\r\n      loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no advantage to anyone,\r\n      tormented her incessantly. His letters for the most part irritated her. It\r\n      hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him, he was\r\n      living a real life, seeing new places and new people that interested him.\r\n      The more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt. Her letters\r\n      to him, far from giving her any comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and\r\n      artificial obligation. She could not write, because she could not conceive\r\n      the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part\r\n      of what she expressed by voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him\r\n      formal, monotonous, and dry letters, to which she attached no importance\r\n      herself, and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected her\r\n      mistakes in spelling.\nThere was still no improvement in the countess’ health, but it was\r\n      impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Natásha’s trousseau\r\n      had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince Andrew was expected\r\n      in Moscow, where old Prince Bolkónski was spending the winter, and Natásha\r\n      felt sure he had already arrived.\nSo the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking Sónya and\r\n      Natásha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January."

    "text": "After Prince Andrew’s engagement to Natásha, Pierre without any apparent\r\n      cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before. Firmly\r\n      convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor, and\r\n      happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to which he had devoted\r\n      himself with such ardor—all the zest of such a life vanished after\r\n      the engagement of Andrew and Natásha and the death of Joseph Alexéevich,\r\n      the news of which reached him almost at the same time. Only the skeleton\r\n      of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors\r\n      of a very important personage, acquaintance with all Petersburg, and his\r\n      court service with its dull formalities. And this life suddenly seemed to\r\n      Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He ceased keeping a diary, avoided the\r\n      company of the Brothers, began going to the club again, drank a great\r\n      deal, and came once more in touch with the bachelor sets, leading such a\r\n      life that the Countess Hélène thought it necessary to speak severely to\r\n      him about it. Pierre felt that she was right, and to avoid compromising\r\n      her went away to Moscow.\nIn Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and\r\n      fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as,\r\n      driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable\r\n      tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the Krémlin Square\r\n      with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and hovels of\r\n      the Sívtsev Vrazhók, those old Moscovites who desired nothing, hurried\r\n      nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he saw those old\r\n      Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he felt himself at\r\n      home in a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at home, warm and dirty\r\n      as in an old dressing gown.\nMoscow society, from the old women down to the children, received Pierre\r\n      like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him. For\r\n      Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most intellectual,\r\n      merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial nobleman of\r\n      the old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was open to\r\n      everyone.\nBenefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent societies, gypsy\r\n      choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons, churches, and\r\n      books—no one and nothing met with a refusal from him, and had it not\r\n      been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and taken him\r\n      under their protection, he would have given everything away. There was\r\n      never a dinner or soiree at the club without him. As soon as he sank into\r\n      his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux he was surrounded, and\r\n      talking, disputing, and joking began. When there were quarrels, his kindly\r\n      smile and well-timed jests reconciled the antagonists. The Masonic dinners\r\n      were dull and dreary when he was not there.\nWhen after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile,\r\n      yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere\r\n      with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men. At\r\n      balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies, married and\r\n      unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of them, he was\r\n      equally amiable to all, especially after supper.“Il est charmant; il n’a\r\n      pas de sexe,”* they said of him.\n* “He is charming; he has no sex.”\nPierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were\r\n      hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.\nHow horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first arrived\r\n      from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or\r\n      plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally predetermined,\r\n      and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in his position were.\r\n      He could not have believed it! Had he not at one time longed with all his\r\n      heart to establish a republic in Russia; then himself to be a Napoleon;\r\n      then to be a philosopher; and then a strategist and the conqueror of\r\n      Napoleon? Had he not seen the possibility of, and passionately desired,\r\n      the regeneration of the sinful human race, and his own progress to the\r\n      highest degree of perfection? Had he not established schools and hospitals\r\n      and liberated his serfs?\nBut instead of all that—here he was, the wealthy husband of an\r\n      unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and\r\n      drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the government a\r\n      bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal favorite in\r\n      Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea\r\n      that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting he had\r\n      so despised seven years before.\nSometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living\r\n      this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how many,\r\n      like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily, with all\r\n      their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single tooth or hair\r\n      remained.\nIn moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to him that\r\n      he was quite different and distinct from those other retired\r\n      gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty, stupid,\r\n      contented fellows, satisfied with their position, “while I am still\r\n      discontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all these\r\n      comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a path\r\n      in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of circumstances,\r\n      society, and race—by that elemental force against which man is\r\n      powerless—to the condition I am in,” said he to himself in moments\r\n      of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer despised,\r\n      but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his comrades in\r\n      destiny, as he pitied himself.\nPierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust\r\n      with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute\r\n      attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment. “What for?\r\n      Why? What is going on in the world?” he would ask himself in perplexity\r\n      several times a day, involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the\r\n      meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by experience that there\r\n      were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from them,\r\n      and took up a book, or hurried off to the club or to Apollón\r\n      Nikoláevich’s, to exchange the gossip of the town.\n“Hélène, who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of\r\n      the stupidest women in the world,” thought Pierre, “is regarded by people\r\n      as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they pay homage to her.\r\n      Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great, but now\r\n      that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor Francis wants to offer\r\n      him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The Spaniards, through the\r\n      Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their victory over the French on\r\n      the fourteenth of June, and the French, also through the Catholic clergy,\r\n      offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June they defeated the\r\n      Spaniards. My brother Masons swear by the blood that they are ready to\r\n      sacrifice everything for their neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each\r\n      to the collections for the poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge\r\n      against the Manna Seekers, and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a\r\n      charter that nobody needs, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote\r\n      it does not understand. We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of\r\n      injuries and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have\r\n      built in Moscow forty times forty churches—but yesterday a deserter\r\n      was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and\r\n      forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his\r\n      execution.” So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception\r\n      which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each\r\n      time as if it were something new. “I understand the deception and\r\n      confusion,” he thought, “but how am I to tell them all that I see? I have\r\n      tried, and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls\r\n      understand it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears that it\r\n      must be so! But I—what is to become of me?” thought he. He had the\r\n      unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and\r\n      believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the evil\r\n      and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it.\r\n      Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and deception.\r\n      Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and falsehood of\r\n      it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he had to live and\r\n      to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under the burden of these\r\n      insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to\r\n      forget them. He frequented every kind of society, drank much, bought\r\n      pictures, engaged in building, and above all—read.\nHe read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home, while his\r\n      valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book and began to\r\n      read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping to gossip in\r\n      drawing rooms of the club, from gossip to carousals and women; from\r\n      carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking became more and more\r\n      a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the doctors warned him that\r\n      with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him, he drank a great deal. He\r\n      was only quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine\r\n      mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body,\r\n      an amiability toward all his fellows, and a readiness to respond\r\n      superficially to every idea without probing it deeply. Only after emptying\r\n      a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life\r\n      which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought.\r\n      He was always conscious of some aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in\r\n      his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or\r\n      read. But under the influence of wine he said to himself: “It doesn’t\r\n      matter. I’ll get it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but have no time\r\n      now—I’ll think it all out later on!” But thelater onnever came.\nIn the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions appeared as\r\n      insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up a book, and\r\n      if anyone came to see him he was glad.\nSometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when\r\n      entrenched under the enemy’s fire, if they have nothing to do, try hard to\r\n      find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To Pierre all men\r\n      seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life: some in ambition,\r\n      some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women, some in toys, some in\r\n      horses, some in politics, some in sport, some in wine, and some in\r\n      governmental affairs. “Nothing is trivial, and nothing is important, it’s\r\n      all the same—only to save oneself from it as best one can,” thought\r\n      Pierre. “Only not to seeit, that dreadfulit!”"

    "text": "At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolkónski and his daughter\r\n      moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alexander’s\r\n      regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French tendency prevailed\r\n      there, and this, together with his past and his intellect and his\r\n      originality, at once made Prince Nicholas Bolkónski an object of\r\n      particular respect to the Moscovites and the center of the Moscow\r\n      opposition to the government.\nThe prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of\r\n      senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent\r\n      events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which he\r\n      accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of this the\r\n      old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful\r\n      veneration—especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his\r\n      old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone, told his\r\n      abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing\r\n      criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with its\r\n      gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and the\r\n      stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his gentle\r\n      daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him\r\n      presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors did not\r\n      reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their host,\r\n      there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the private and\r\n      intimate life of the house continued.\nLatterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary. There\r\n      in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures—talks with the\r\n      pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills—and she\r\n      had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not go out\r\n      into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere\r\n      without him, and his failing health prevented his going out himself, so\r\n      that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. She had quite\r\n      abandoned the hope of getting married. She saw the coldness and\r\n      malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the young\r\n      men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. She had no\r\n      friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in the two\r\n      who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom she had\r\n      never been able to be quite frank, had now become unpleasant to her, and\r\n      for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom she had\r\n      corresponded for the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved to be\r\n      quite alien to her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the death of her\r\n      brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow, was in the\r\n      full whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young men who, she\r\n      fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth. Julie was at that\r\n      stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance\r\n      of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never. On\r\n      Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had\r\n      no one to write to, since Julie—whose presence gave her no pleasure\r\n      was here and they met every week. Like the oldémigréwho declined to\r\n      marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years, she\r\n      regretted Julie’s presence and having no one to write to. In Moscow\r\n      Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one to whom to confide her sorrow,\r\n      and much sorrow fell to her lot just then. The time for Prince Andrew’s\r\n      return and marriage was approaching, but his request to her to prepare his\r\n      father for it had not been carried out; in fact, it seemed as if matters\r\n      were quite hopeless, for at every mention of the young Countess Rostóva\r\n      the old prince (who apart from that was usually in a bad temper) lost\r\n      control of himself. Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she\r\n      gave her six year-old nephew. To her consternation she detected in herself\r\n      in relation to little Nicholas some symptoms of her father’s irritability.\r\n      However often she told herself that she must not get irritable when\r\n      teaching her nephew, almost every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down\r\n      to show him the French alphabet, she so longed to pour her own knowledge\r\n      quickly and easily into the child—who was already afraid that Auntie\r\n      might at any moment get angry—that at his slightest inattention she\r\n      trembled, became flustered and heated, raised her voice, and sometimes\r\n      pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner. Having put him in the\r\n      corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and\r\n      little Nicholas, following her example, would sob, and without permission\r\n      would leave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and\r\n      comfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her father’s\r\n      irritability, which was always directed against her and had of late\r\n      amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground\r\n      all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water, it would\r\n      never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this loving\r\n      despot—the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason\r\n      tormented himself and her—knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate\r\n      her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame for\r\n      everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented Princess\r\n      Mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing intimacy with\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at the first moment of receiving the\r\n      news of his son’s intentions had occurred to him in jest—that if\r\n      Andrew got married he himself would marry Bourienne—had evidently\r\n      pleased him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it seemed to\r\n      Princess Mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments to the\r\n      companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by\r\n      demonstrations of love of Bourienne.\nOne day in Moscow in Princess Mary’s presence (she thought her father did\r\n      it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne’s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.\r\n      Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary’s room smiling and making\r\n      cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily wiped away\r\n      her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne, and evidently\r\n      unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the\r\n      Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: “It’s horrible, vile, inhuman, to take\r\n      advantage of the weakness...” She did not finish. “Leave my room,” she\r\n      exclaimed, and burst into sobs.\nNext day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed\r\n      that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be served\r\n      first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from habit began\r\n      with the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious, threw his stick at\r\n      Philip, and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the\r\n      army.\n“He doesn’t obey... I said it twice... and he doesn’t obey! She is the\r\n      first person in this house; she’s my best friend,” cried the prince. “And\r\n      if you allow yourself,” he screamed in a fury, addressing Princess Mary\r\n      for the first time, “to forget yourself again before her as you dared to\r\n      do yesterday, I will show you who is master in this house. Go! Don’t let\r\n      me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!”\nPrincess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne’s pardon, and also her father’s\r\n      pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged for her\r\n      intervention.\nAt such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul.\r\n      And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles\r\n      in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or would forget\r\n      something that had just occurred, or take a false step with his failing\r\n      legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness, or, worst of\r\n      all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly\r\n      fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his\r\n      plate. “He is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn him!” she thought at\r\n      such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against herself."

    "text": "In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor—Métivier—who\r\n      had rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable\r\n      as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily clever\r\n      doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but as\r\n      an equal.\nPrince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne’s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and\r\n      had grown accustomed to him. Métivier came to see the prince about twice a\r\n      week.\nOn December 6—St. Nicholas’ Day and the prince’s name day—all\r\n      Moscow came to the prince’s front door but he gave orders to admit no one\r\n      and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave to\r\n      Princess Mary.\nMétivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered it\r\n      proper in his quality of doctorde forcer la consigne, * as he told\r\n      Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on that\r\n      morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods. He had\r\n      been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and\r\n      pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood\r\n      himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed\r\n      querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage, and she went\r\n      about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and\r\n      awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctor’s arrival the morning\r\n      had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor, Princess Mary sat down\r\n      with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she could hear\r\n      all that passed in the study.\n* To force the guard.\nAt first she heard only Métivier’s voice, then her father’s, then both\r\n      voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open, and on\r\n      the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified Métivier with\r\n      his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing gown and fez, his\r\n      face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards.\n“You don’t understand?” shouted the prince, “but I do!\r\n      French spy, slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell\r\n      you...” and he slammed the door.\nMétivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne who\r\n      at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.\n“The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head. Keep\r\n      calm, I will call again tomorrow,” said Métivier; and putting his fingers\r\n      to his lips he hastened away.\nThrough the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:\r\n      “Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment’s peace in my own\r\n      house!”\nAfter Métivier’s departure the old prince called his daughter in, and the\r\n      whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy had\r\n      been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not\r\n      to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that scoundrel\r\n      admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he could not\r\n      have a moment’s peace and could not die quietly.\n“No, ma’am! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand it! I\r\n      cannot endure any more,” he said, and left the room. Then, as if afraid\r\n      she might find some means of consolation, he returned and trying to appear\r\n      calm added: “And don’t imagine I have said this in a moment of anger. I am\r\n      calm. I have thought it over, and it will be carried out—we must\r\n      part; so find some place for yourself....” But he could not restrain\r\n      himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is capable,\r\n      evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at her and screamed:\n“If only some fool would marry her!” Then he slammed the door, sent for\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.\nAt two o’clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.\nThese guests—the famous Count Rostopchín, Prince Lopukhín with his\r\n      nephew, General Chatróv an old war comrade of the prince’s, and of the\r\n      younger generation Pierre and Borís Drubetskóy—awaited the prince in\r\n      the drawing room.\nBorís, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been anxious\r\n      to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkónski, and had contrived to\r\n      ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an\r\n      exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.\nThe prince’s house did not belong to what is known asfashionable\r\n      society, but his little circle—though not much talked about in\r\n      town—was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.\r\n      Borís had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in his\r\n      presence invited Rostopchín to dinner on St. Nicholas’ Day, and Rostopchín\r\n      had replied that he could not come:\n“On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince\r\n      Nicholas Bolkónski.”\n“Oh, yes, yes!” replied the commander in chief. “How is he?...”\nThe small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned\r\n      drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a\r\n      court of justice. All were silent or talked in low tones. Prince Nicholas\r\n      came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed even quieter and more\r\n      diffident than usual. The guests were reluctant to address her, feeling\r\n      that she was in no mood for their conversation. Count Rostopchín alone\r\n      kept the conversation going, now relating the latest town news, and now\r\n      the latest political gossip.\nLopukhín and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation.\r\n      Prince Bolkónski listened as a presiding judge receives a report, only now\r\n      and then, silently or by a brief word, showing that he took heed of what\r\n      was being reported to him. The tone of the conversation was such as\r\n      indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political\r\n      world. Incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that\r\n      everything was going from bad to worse, but whether telling a story or\r\n      giving an opinion the speaker always stopped, or was stopped, at the point\r\n      beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself.\nAt dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon’s seizure\r\n      of the Duke of Oldenburg’s territory, and the Russian Note, hostile to\r\n      Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.\n“Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,” said Count\r\n      Rostopchín, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before. “One\r\n      only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the crowned heads. Now\r\n      the Pope’s turn has come and Bonaparte doesn’t scruple to depose the head\r\n      of the Catholic Church—yet all keep silent! Our sovereign alone has\r\n      protested against the seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg’s territory, and\r\n      even...” Count Rostopchín paused, feeling that he had reached the limit\r\n      beyond which censure was impossible.\n“Other territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of\r\n      Oldenburg,” said Prince Bolkónski. “He shifts the Dukes about as I might\r\n      move my serfs from Bald Hills to Boguchárovo or my Ryazán estates.”\n“The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of\r\n      character and resignation,” remarked Borís, joining in respectfully.\nHe said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor\r\n      of being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolkónski glanced at the young man\r\n      as if about to say something in reply, but changed his mind, evidently\r\n      considering him too young.\n“I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised how\r\n      badly the Note was worded,” remarked Count Rostopchín in the casual tone\r\n      of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.\nPierre looked at Rostopchín with naïve astonishment, not understanding why\r\n      he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.\n“Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,” he asked, “so long as its\r\n      substance is forcible?”\n“My dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy\r\n      to have a good style,” returned Count Rostopchín.\nPierre now understood the count’s dissatisfaction with the wording of the\r\n      Note.\n“One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,” remarked the\r\n      old prince. “There in Petersburg they are always writing—not notes\r\n      only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written a whole volume of laws\r\n      for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!” and he laughed unnaturally.\nThere was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared\r\n      his throat to draw attention.\n“Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The figure\r\n      cut by the new French ambassador.”\n“Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His Majesty’s\r\n      presence.”\n“His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march\r\n      past,” continued the general, “and it seems the ambassador took no notice\r\n      and allowed himself to reply that: ‘We in France pay no attention to such\r\n      trifles!’ The Emperor did not condescend to reply. At the next review,\r\n      they say, the Emperor did not once deign to address him.”\nAll were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was\r\n      impossible to pass any judgment.\n“Impudent fellows!” said the prince. “You know Métivier? I turned him out\r\n      of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in spite of my\r\n      request that they should let no one in,” he went on, glancing angrily at\r\n      his daughter.\nAnd he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and the\r\n      reasons that convinced him that Métivier was a spy. Though these reasons\r\n      were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.\nAfter the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate the\r\n      old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.\nHe gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled, clean-shaven\r\n      cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told her that he had not\r\n      forgotten the morning’s talk, that his decision remained in force, and\r\n      only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now.\nWhen they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the old men\r\n      sat together.\nPrince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the\r\n      impending war.\nHe said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we\r\n      sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European\r\n      affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit. “We ought\r\n      not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political interests are\r\n      all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing is to have an\r\n      armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will never dare to cross the\r\n      Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!”\n“How can we fight the French, Prince?” said Count Rostopchín. “Can we arm\r\n      ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at our youths, look at\r\n      our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our Kingdom of Heaven.”\nHe began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.\n“French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned\r\n      Métivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and a\r\n      scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to a\r\n      party last night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman Catholics\r\n      and had the Pope’s indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays. And they\r\n      themselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our Public Baths\r\n      if I may say so. Ah, when one looks at our young people, Prince, one would\r\n      like to take Peter the Great’s old cudgel out of the museum and belabor\r\n      them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them.”\nAll were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopchín with a smile and\r\n      wagged his head approvingly.\n“Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!” said Rostopchín, getting up\r\n      with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince.\n“Good-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of hearing\r\n      him!” said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek\r\n      to be kissed.\nFollowing Rostopchín’s example the others also rose."

    "text": "Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old men’s talk and faultfinding,\r\n      understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered whether the guests\r\n      had all observed her father’s hostile attitude toward her. She did not\r\n      even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during\r\n      dinner by Borís Drubetskóy, who was visiting them for the third time\r\n      already.\nPrincess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who\r\n      hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to\r\n      approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in\r\n      the drawing room.\n“May I stay a little longer?” he said, letting his stout body sink into an\r\n      armchair beside her.\n“Oh yes,” she answered. “You noticed nothing?” her look asked.\nPierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight before\r\n      him and smiled quietly.\n“Have you known that young man long, Princess?” he asked.\n“Who?”\n“Drubetskóy.”\n“No, not long....”\n“Do you like him?”\n“Yes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?” said\r\n      Princess Mary, still thinking of that morning’s conversation with her\r\n      father.\n“Because I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from\r\n      Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an\r\n      heiress.”\n“You have observed that?” said Princess Mary.\n“Yes,” returned Pierre with a smile, “and this young man now manages\r\n      matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too. I can\r\n      read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay siege to—you\r\n      or Mademoiselle Julie Karágina. He is very attentive to her.”\n“He visits them?”\n“Yes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?” said Pierre\r\n      with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored\r\n      raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary.\n“No,” replied Princess Mary.\n“To please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is very\r\n      melancholy with Mademoiselle Karágina,” said Pierre.\n“Really?” asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre’s kindly face and still\r\n      thinking of her own sorrow. “It would be a relief,” thought she, “if I\r\n      ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone. I should like to tell\r\n      everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It would be a relief. He\r\n      would give me advice.”\n“Would you marry him?”\n“Oh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!” she\r\n      cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice. “Ah, how\r\n      bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that...” she went on\r\n      in a trembling voice, “that you can do nothing for him but grieve him, and\r\n      to know that you cannot alter this. Then there is only one thing left—to\r\n      go away, but where could I go?”\n“What is wrong? What is it, Princess?”\nBut without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into tears.\n“I don’t know what is the matter with me today. Don’t take any notice—forget\r\n      what I have said!”\nPierre’s gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the princess,\r\n      asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but she only\r\n      repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that she did not\r\n      remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble except the one he\r\n      knew of—that Prince Andrew’s marriage threatened to cause a rupture\r\n      between father and son.\n“Have you any news of the Rostóvs?” she asked, to change the subject. “I\r\n      was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew any day. I\r\n      should like them to meet here.”\n“And how does he now regard the matter?” asked Pierre, referring to the\r\n      old prince.\nPrincess Mary shook her head.\n“What is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The thing is\r\n      impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments. I wish\r\n      they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her. You have known them\r\n      a long time,” said Princess Mary. “Tell me honestly the whole truth: what\r\n      sort of girl is she, and what do you think of her?—The real truth,\r\n      because you know Andrew is risking so much doing this against his father’s\r\n      will that I should like to know....”\nAn undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and repeated\r\n      requests to be told thewhole truth, expressed ill-will on the princess’\r\n      part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that he should disapprove\r\n      of Andrew’s choice; but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he\r\n      thought.\n“I don’t know how to answer your question,” he said, blushing without\r\n      knowing why. “I really don’t know what sort of girl she is; I can’t\r\n      analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I don’t know.\r\n      That is all one can say about her.”\nPrincess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: “Yes, that’s\r\n      what I expected and feared.”\n“Is she clever?” she asked.\nPierre considered.\n“I think not,” he said, “and yet—yes. She does not deign to be\r\n      clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.”\nPrincess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.\n“Ah, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.”\n“I hear they are expected very soon,” said Pierre.\nPrincess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future\r\n      sister-in-law as soon as the Rostóvs arrived and to try to accustom the\r\n      old prince to her."

    "text": "Borís had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, so with\r\n      the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered between the\r\n      two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though Princess Mary\r\n      despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he,\r\n      without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her. When they had\r\n      last met on the old prince’s name day, she had answered at random all his\r\n      attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what he was\r\n      saying.\nJulie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a manner\r\n      peculiar to herself.\nShe was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become very\r\n      wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself not merely as\r\n      good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She was confirmed in\r\n      this delusion by the fact that she had become a very wealthy heiress and\r\n      also by the fact that the older she grew the less dangerous she became to\r\n      men, and the more freely they could associate with her and avail\r\n      themselves of her suppers, soirees, and the animated company that\r\n      assembled at her house, without incurring any obligation. A man who would\r\n      have been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house when\r\n      there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of compromising her and\r\n      committing himself, would now go boldly every day and treat her not as a\r\n      marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.\nThat winter the Karágins’ house was the most agreeable and hospitable in\r\n      Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large\r\n      company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight and\r\n      staying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a promenade,\r\n      or a play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion. But in spite of\r\n      that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone\r\n      that she did not believe either in friendship or in love, or any of the\r\n      joys of life, and expected peace only “yonder.” She adopted the tone of\r\n      one who has suffered a great disappointment, like a girl who has either\r\n      lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him. Though nothing of\r\n      the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light, and had even\r\n      herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life. This\r\n      melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing herself, did not hinder the\r\n      young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly. Every\r\n      visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of\r\n      the hostess, and then amused himself with society gossip, dancing,\r\n      intellectual games, andbouts rimés, which were in vogue at the Karágins’.\r\n      Only a few of these young men, among them Borís, entered more deeply into\r\n      Julie’s melancholy, and with these she had prolonged conversations in\r\n      private on the vanity of all worldly things, and to them she showed her\r\n      albums filled with mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.\nTo Borís, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early\r\n      disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of friendship as\r\n      she who had herself suffered so much could render, and showed him her\r\n      album. Borís sketched two trees in the album and wrote: “Rustic trees,\r\n      your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.”\nOn another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:\nLa mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.Ah! contre les douleurs il n’y a pas d’autre asile.*\n* Death gives relief and death is peaceful.Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.\nJulie said this was charming\n“There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,” she said to\r\n      Borís, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book. “It\r\n      is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness and despair,\r\n      showing the possibility of consolation.”\nIn reply Borís wrote these lines:\nAliment de poison d’une âme trop sensible,Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,Tendre mélancholie, ah, viens me consoler,Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,Et mêle une douceur secrèteA ces pleurs que je sens couler.*\n*Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,And mingle a secret sweetnessWith these tears that I feel to be flowing.\nFor Borís, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Borís readPoor Lizaaloud to her, and more than once interrupted the reading\r\n      because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large gatherings Julie\r\n      and Borís looked on one another as the only souls who understood one\r\n      another in a world of indifferent people.\nAnna Mikháylovna, who often visited the Karágins, while playing cards with\r\n      the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie’s dowry (she was to have two\r\n      estates in Pénza and the Nizhegórod forests). Anna Mikháylovna regarded\r\n      the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy Julie with emotion,\r\n      and resignation to the Divine will.\n“You are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,” she said to the\r\n      daughter. “Borís says his soul finds repose at your house. He has suffered\r\n      so many disappointments and is so sensitive,” said she to the mother. “Ah,\r\n      my dear, I can’t tell you how fond I have grown of Julie latterly,” she\r\n      said to her son. “But who could help loving her? She is an angelic being!\r\n      Ah, Borís, Borís!”—she paused. “And how I pity her mother,” she went\r\n      on; “today she showed me her accounts and letters from Pénza (they have\r\n      enormous estates there), and she, poor thing, has no one to help her, and\r\n      they do cheat her so!”\nBorís smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. He\r\n      laughed blandly at her naïve diplomacy but listened to what she had to\r\n      say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Pénza and Nizhegórod\r\n      estates.\nJulie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and\r\n      was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion for her, for\r\n      her passionate desire to get married, for her artificiality, and a feeling\r\n      of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still restrained\r\n      Borís. His leave was expiring. He spent every day and whole days at the\r\n      Karágins’, and every day on thinking the matter over told himself that he\r\n      would propose tomorrow. But in Julie’s presence, looking at her red face\r\n      and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and her expression of\r\n      continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural\r\n      rapture of married bliss, Borís could not utter the decisive words, though\r\n      in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of those\r\n      Pénza and Nizhegórod estates and had apportioned the use of the income\r\n      from them. Julie saw Borís’ indecision, and sometimes the thought occurred\r\n      to her that she was repulsive to him, but her feminine self-deception\r\n      immediately supplied her with consolation, and she told herself that he\r\n      was only shy from love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to\r\n      irritability, and not long before Borís’ departure she formed a definite\r\n      plan of action. Just as Borís’ leave of absence was expiring, Anatole\r\n      Kurágin made his appearance in Moscow, and of course in the Karágins’\r\n      drawing room, and Julie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became\r\n      cheerful and very attentive to Kurágin.\n“My dear,” said Anna Mikháylovna to her son, “I know from a reliable\r\n      source that Prince Vasíli has sent his son to Moscow to get him married to\r\n      Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for her. What do you\r\n      think of it, my dear?”\nThe idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole\r\n      month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all the\r\n      revenue from the Pénza estates which he had already mentally apportioned\r\n      and put to proper use fall into the hands of another, and especially into\r\n      the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Borís. He drove to the Karágins’\r\n      with the firm intention of proposing. Julie met him in a gay, careless\r\n      manner, spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterday’s ball, and asked\r\n      when he was leaving. Though Borís had come intentionally to speak of his\r\n      love and therefore meant to be tender, he began speaking irritably of\r\n      feminine inconstancy, of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy,\r\n      and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to\r\n      them. Julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs\r\n      variety, and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone.\n“Then I should advise you...” Borís began, wishing to sting her; but at\r\n      that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to\r\n      leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have vainly wasted\r\n      his efforts—which was a thing he never allowed to happen.\nHe checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to\r\n      avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:\n“I did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...”\nHe glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability had\r\n      suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were fixed on him\r\n      with greedy expectation. “I can always arrange so as not to see her\r\n      often,” thought Borís. “The affair has been begun and must be finished!”\r\n       He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and said:\n“You know my feelings for you!”\nThere was no need to say more: Julie’s face shone with triumph and\r\n      self-satisfaction; but she forced Borís to say all that is said on such\r\n      occasions—that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more\r\n      than her. She knew that for the Pénza estates and Nizhegórod forests she\r\n      could demand this, and she received what she demanded.\nThe affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and\r\n      melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house in\r\n      Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding."

    "text": "At the end of January old Count Rostóv went to Moscow with Natásha and\r\n      Sónya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was\r\n      impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in Moscow\r\n      any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near Moscow had to\r\n      be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his future\r\n      daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkónski while he was in Moscow could not\r\n      be missed. The Rostóvs’ Moscow house had not been heated that winter and,\r\n      as they had come only for a short time and the countess was not with them,\r\n      the count decided to stay with Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, who had long\r\n      been pressing her hospitality on them.\nLate one evening the Rostóvs’ four sleighs drove into Márya Dmítrievna’s\r\n      courtyard in the old Konyúsheny street. Márya Dmítrievna lived alone. She\r\n      had already married off her daughter, and her sons were all in the\r\n      service.\nShe held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly, loudly,\r\n      and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to others for\r\n      any weakness, passion, or temptation—the possibility of which she\r\n      did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing jacket, she\r\n      attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out: on holy days to\r\n      church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of which she\r\n      never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after dressing, she received\r\n      petitioners of various classes, of whom there were always some. Then she\r\n      had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal at which there were always\r\n      three or four guests; after dinner she played a game of boston, and at\r\n      night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her while she knitted.\r\n      She rarely made an exception and went out to pay visits, and then only to\r\n      the most important persons in the town.\nShe had not yet gone to bed when the Rostóvs arrived and the pulley of the\r\n      hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rostóvs and their\r\n      servants. Márya Dmítrievna, with her spectacles hanging down on her nose\r\n      and her head flung back, stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern,\r\n      grim face at the new arrivals. One might have thought she was angry with\r\n      the travelers and would immediately turn them out, had she not at the same\r\n      time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the\r\n      accommodation of the visitors and their belongings.\n“The count’s things? Bring them here,” she said, pointing to the\r\n      portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. “The young ladies’? There to the\r\n      left. Now what are you dawdling for?” she cried to the maids. “Get the\r\n      samovar ready!... You’ve grown plumper and prettier,” she remarked,\r\n      drawing Natásha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by the\r\n      hood. “Foo! Youarecold! Now take off your things, quick!” she shouted to\r\n      the count who was going to kiss her hand. “You’re half frozen, I’m sure!\r\n      Bring some rum for tea!...Bonjour, Sónya dear!” she added, turning to\r\n      Sónya and indicating by this French greeting her slightly contemptuous\r\n      though affectionate attitude toward her.\nWhen they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and tidied\r\n      themselves up after their journey, Márya Dmítrievna kissed them all in due\r\n      order.\n“I’m heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was high\r\n      time,” she said, giving Natásha a significant look. “The old man is here\r\n      and his son’s expected any day. You’ll have to make his acquaintance. But\r\n      we’ll speak of that later on,” she added, glancing at Sónya with a look\r\n      that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence. “Now listen,”\r\n       she said to the count. “What do you want tomorrow? Whom will you send for?\r\n      Shinshín?” she crooked one of her fingers. “The sniveling Anna\r\n      Mikháylovna? That’s two. She’s here with her son. The son is getting\r\n      married! Then Bezúkhov, eh? He is here too, with his wife. He ran away\r\n      from her and she came galloping after him. He dined with me on Wednesday.\r\n      As for them”—and she pointed to the girls—“tomorrow I’ll take\r\n      them first to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God, and then we’ll\r\n      drive to the Super-Rogue’s. I suppose you’ll have everything new. Don’t\r\n      judge by me: sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess\r\n      Irína Vasílevna came to see me; she was an awful sight—looked as if\r\n      she had put two barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without\r\n      some new fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?” she asked the\r\n      count sternly.\n“One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a\r\n      purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If you\r\n      will be so kind, I’ll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a day,\r\n      and leave my lassies with you.”\n“All right. All right. They’ll be safe with me, as safe as in Chancery!\r\n      I’ll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet them a bit,”\r\n       said Márya Dmítrievna, touching her goddaughter and favorite, Natásha, on\r\n      the cheek with her large hand.\nNext morning Márya Dmítrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian shrine\r\n      of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so afraid of\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss merely to\r\n      get rid of her. Márya Dmítrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau. When\r\n      they got home she turned everybody out of the room except Natásha, and\r\n      then called her pet to her armchair.\n“Well, now we’ll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed. You’ve hooked\r\n      a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I’ve known him since he was so\r\n      high.” She held her hand a couple of feet from the ground. Natásha blushed\r\n      happily. “I like him and all his family. Now listen! You know that old\r\n      Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son’s marrying. The old fellow’s\r\n      crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift without\r\n      him, but it’s not nice to enter a family against a father’s will. One\r\n      wants to do it peacefully and lovingly. You’re a clever girl and you’ll\r\n      know how to manage. Be kind, and use your wits. Then all will be well.”\nNatásha remained silent, from shyness Márya Dmítrievna supposed, but\r\n      really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love of\r\n      Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs that no\r\n      one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he loved her\r\n      only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She wanted nothing\r\n      more.\n“You see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your\r\n      future sister-in-law. ‘Husbands’ sisters bring up blisters,’ but this one\r\n      wouldn’t hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two together. Tomorrow\r\n      you’ll go with your father to see her. Be very nice and affectionate to\r\n      her: you’re younger than she. Whenhecomes, he’ll find you already know\r\n      his sister and father and are liked by them. Am I right or not? Won’t that\r\n      be best?”\n“Yes, it will,” Natásha answered reluctantly."

    "text": "Next day, by Márya Dmítrievna’s advice, Count Rostóv took Natásha to call\r\n      on Prince Nicholas Bolkónski. The count did not set out cheerfully on this\r\n      visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well remembered the last interview he\r\n      had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment, when in reply\r\n      to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an angry reprimand for\r\n      not having provided his full quota of men. Natásha, on the other hand,\r\n      having put on her best gown, was in the highest spirits. “They can’t help\r\n      liking me,” she thought. “Everybody always has liked me, and I am so\r\n      willing to do anything they wish, so ready to be fond of him—for\r\n      beinghisfather—and of her—for beinghissister—that\r\n      there is no reason for them not to like me....”\nThey drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvízhenka and entered the\r\n      vestibule.\n“Well, the Lord have mercy on us!” said the count, half in jest, half in\r\n      earnest; but Natásha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the\r\n      anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess\r\n      were at home.\nWhen they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the\r\n      servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another\r\n      in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a maidservant\r\n      ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning the princess.\r\n      At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced to the Rostóvs\r\n      that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess begged them to\r\n      walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors was Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter with special politeness and\r\n      showed them to the princess’ room. The princess, looking excited and\r\n      nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran in to meet the visitors,\r\n      treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear cordial and at ease. From\r\n      the first glance Princess Mary did not like Natásha. She thought her too\r\n      fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and vain. She did not at all realize\r\n      that before having seen her future sister-in-law she was prejudiced\r\n      against her by involuntary envy of her beauty, youth, and happiness, as\r\n      well as by jealousy of her brother’s love for her. Apart from this\r\n      insuperable antipathy to her, Princess Mary was agitated just then because\r\n      on the Rostóvs’ being announced, the old prince had shouted that he did\r\n      not wish to see them, that Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but\r\n      they were not to be admitted to him. She had decided to receive them, but\r\n      feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some freak, as he\r\n      seemed much upset by the Rostóvs’ visit.\n“There, my dear princess, I’ve brought you my songstress,” said the count,\r\n      bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince might\r\n      appear. “I am so glad you should get to know one another... very sorry the\r\n      prince is still ailing,” and after a few more commonplace remarks he rose.\r\n      “If you’ll allow me to leave my Natásha in your hands for a quarter of an\r\n      hour, Princess, I’ll drive round to see Anna Semënovna, it’s quite near in\r\n      the Dogs’ Square, and then I’ll come back for her.”\nThe count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his\r\n      daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk to one\r\n      another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering\r\n      the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention this to his\r\n      daughter, but Natásha noticed her father’s nervousness and anxiety and\r\n      felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still angrier at having\r\n      blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression\r\n      which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The princess told the count\r\n      that she would be delighted, and only begged him to stay longer at Anna\r\n      Semënovna’s, and he departed.\nDespite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary—who wished\r\n      to have a tête-à-tête with Natásha—Mademoiselle Bourienne remained\r\n      in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and theaters.\r\n      Natásha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom,\r\n      by her father’s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess\r\n      who—she thought—was making a favor of receiving her, and so\r\n      everything displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom she\r\n      thought very plain, affected, and dry. Natásha suddenly shrank into\r\n      herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated Princess\r\n      Mary still more. After five minutes of irksome, constrained conversation,\r\n      they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching. Princess Mary\r\n      looked frightened.\nThe door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white\r\n      nightcap, came in.\n“Ah, madam!” he began. “Madam, Countess... Countess Rostóva,\r\n      if I am not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not know,\r\n      madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with a visit, and I\r\n      came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg you to excuse me...\r\n      God is my witness, I didn’t know—” he repeated, stressing the\r\n      word “God” so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that Princess Mary\r\n      stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her father or at Natásha.\nNor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.\n“I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not know,”\r\n       muttered the old man, and after looking Natásha over from head to foot he\r\n      went out.\nMademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this\r\n      apparition and began speaking about the prince’s indisposition. Natásha\r\n      and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the longer they\r\n      did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater grew their\r\n      antipathy to one another.\nWhen the count returned, Natásha was impolitely pleased and hastened to\r\n      get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who could\r\n      place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an hour with\r\n      her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. “I couldn’t begin talking about\r\n      him in the presence of that Frenchwoman,” thought Natásha. The same\r\n      thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She knew what she ought to\r\n      have said to Natásha, but she had been unable to say it because\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because, without knowing why,\r\n      she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage. When the count was\r\n      already leaving the room, Princess Mary went up hurriedly to Natásha, took\r\n      her by the hand, and said with a deep sigh:\n“Wait, I must...”\nNatásha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.\n“Dear Natalie,” said Princess Mary, “I want you to know that I am glad my\r\n      brother has found happiness....”\nShe paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. Natásha noticed\r\n      this and guessed its reason.\n“I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,” she said\r\n      with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears choking her.\n“What have I said and what have I done?” thought she, as soon as she was\r\n      out of the room.\nThey waited a long time for Natásha to come to dinner that day. She sat in\r\n      her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. Sónya stood\r\n      beside her, kissing her hair.\n“Natásha, what is it about?” she asked. “What do they matter to you? It\r\n      will all pass, Natásha.”\n“But if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...”\n“Don’t talk about it, Natásha. It wasn’t your fault so why should you\r\n      mind? Kiss me,” said Sónya.\nNatásha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed her\r\n      wet face against her.\n“I can’t tell you, I don’t know. No one’s to blame,” said Natásha—“It’s\r\n      my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why doesn’t he come?...”\nShe came in to dinner with red eyes. Márya Dmítrievna, who knew how the\r\n      prince had received the Rostóvs, pretended not to notice how upset Natásha\r\n      was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and the other\r\n      guests."

    "text": "That evening the Rostóvs went to the Opera, for which Márya Dmítrievna had\r\n      taken a box.\nNatásha did not want to go, but could not refuse Márya Dmítrievna’s kind\r\n      offer which was intended expressly for her. When she came ready dressed\r\n      into the ballroom to await her father, and looking in the large mirror\r\n      there saw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt even more sad, but it\r\n      was a sweet, tender sadness.\n“O God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but\r\n      differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply\r\n      embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching\r\n      inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I would\r\n      make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes—how I see those\r\n      eyes!” thought Natásha. “And what do his father and sister matter to me? I\r\n      love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with his smile,\r\n      manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not think of him; not think\r\n      of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present. I can’t bear this\r\n      waiting and I shall cry in a minute!” and she turned away from the glass,\r\n      making an effort not to cry. “And how can Sónya love Nicholas so calmly\r\n      and quietly and wait so long and so patiently?” thought she, looking at\r\n      Sónya, who also came in quite ready, with a fan in her hand. “No, she’s\r\n      altogether different. I can’t!”\nNatásha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not enough\r\n      for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at once, to\r\n      embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of love such\r\n      as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside her father,\r\n      pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on the frozen\r\n      window, she felt still sadder and more in love, and forgot where she was\r\n      going and with whom. Having fallen into the line of carriages, the\r\n      Rostóvs’ carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels squeaking over the\r\n      snow. Natásha and Sónya, holding up their dresses, jumped out quickly. The\r\n      count got out helped by the footmen, and, passing among men and women who\r\n      were entering and the program sellers, they all three went along the\r\n      corridor to the first row of boxes. Through the closed doors the music was\r\n      already audible.\n“Natásha, your hair!...” whispered Sónya.\nAn attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and\r\n      opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the\r\n      door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and\r\n      shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before\r\n      their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy at\r\n      Natásha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being played.\r\n      Natásha, smoothing her gown, went in with Sónya and sat down, scanning the\r\n      brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not experienced for\r\n      a long time—that of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and\r\n      neck—suddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and\r\n      called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and emotions associated with\r\n      that feeling.\nThe two remarkably pretty girls, Natásha and Sónya, with Count Rostóv who\r\n      had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general attention.\r\n      Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natásha’s engagement to Prince Andrew,\r\n      and knew that the Rostóvs had lived in the country ever since, and all\r\n      looked with curiosity at a fiancée who was making one of the best matches\r\n      in Russia.\nNatásha’s looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country, and\r\n      that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty. She\r\n      struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty, combined with\r\n      her indifference to everything about her. Her black eyes looked at the\r\n      crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare to above the\r\n      elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently unconsciously,\r\n      she opened and closed her hand in time to the music, crumpling her\r\n      program. “Look, there’s Alénina,” said Sónya, “with her\r\n      mother, isn’t it?”\n“Dear me, Michael Kirílovich has grown still stouter!” remarked the count.\n“Look at our Anna Mikháylovna—what a headdress she has on!”\n“The Karágins, Julie—and Borís with them. One can see at once that\r\n      they’re engaged....”\n“Drubetskóy has proposed?”\n“Oh yes, I heard it today,” said Shinshín, coming into the Rostóvs’ box.\nNatásha looked in the direction in which her father’s eyes were turned and\r\n      saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face and a\r\n      string of pearls round her thick red neck—which Natásha knew was\r\n      covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning over with an\r\n      ear to Julie’s mouth, was Borís’ handsome smoothly brushed head. He looked\r\n      at the Rostóvs from under his brows and said something, smiling, to his\r\n      betrothed.\n“They are talking about us, about me and him!” thought Natásha. “And he no\r\n      doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn’t trouble themselves! If\r\n      only they knew how little I am concerned about any of them.”\nBehind them sat Anna Mikháylovna wearing a green headdress and with a\r\n      happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their box was\r\n      pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which Natásha knew so\r\n      well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly remembered all that\r\n      had been so humiliating in her morning’s visit.\n“What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh, better\r\n      not think of it—not till he comes back!” she told herself, and began\r\n      looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in the stalls. In\r\n      the front, in the very center, leaning back against the orchestra rail,\r\n      stood Dólokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair brushed up into a huge\r\n      shock. He stood in full view of the audience, well aware that he was\r\n      attracting everyone’s attention, yet as much at ease as though he were in\r\n      his own room. Around him thronged Moscow’s most brilliant young men, whom\r\n      he evidently dominated.\nThe count, laughing, nudged the blushing Sónya and pointed to her former\r\n      adorer.\n“Do you recognize him?” said he. “And where has he sprung from?” he asked,\r\n      turning to Shinshín. “Didn’t he vanish somewhere?”\n“He did,” replied Shinshín. “He was in the Caucasus and ran away from\r\n      there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in\r\n      Persia, where he killed the Shah’s brother. Now all the Moscow ladies are\r\n      mad about him! It’s ‘Dólokhov the Persian’ that does it! We never hear a\r\n      word but Dólokhov is mentioned. They swear by him, they offer him to you\r\n      as they would a dish of choice sterlet. Dólokhov and Anatole Kurágin have\r\n      turned all our ladies’ heads.”\nA tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump\r\n      white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of large\r\n      pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a\r\n      long time settling into her place.\nNatásha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and pearls and\r\n      coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls. While\r\n      Natásha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady looked\r\n      round and, meeting the count’s eyes, nodded to him and smiled. She was the\r\n      Countess Bezúkhova, Pierre’s wife, and the count, who knew everyone in\r\n      society, leaned over and spoke to her.\n“Have you been here long, Countess?” he inquired. “I’ll call, I’ll call to\r\n      kiss your hand. I’m here on business and have brought my girls with me.\r\n      They say Semënova acts marvelously. Count Pierre never used to forget us.\r\n      Is he here?”\n“Yes, he meant to look in,” answered Hélène, and glanced attentively at\r\n      Natásha.\nCount Rostóv resumed his seat.\n“Handsome, isn’t she?” he whispered to Natásha.\n“Wonderful!” answered Natásha. “She’s a woman one could easily fall in\r\n      love with.”\nJust then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor\r\n      tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls, and\r\n      the curtain rose.\nAs soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent, and all\r\n      the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and all the women\r\n      with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention with eager\r\n      curiosity to the stage. Natásha too began to look at it."

    "text": "The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was some\r\n      painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth\r\n      stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls in red\r\n      bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat\r\n      apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was\r\n      glued. They all sang something. When they had finished their song the girl\r\n      in white went up to the prompter’s box and a man with tight silk trousers\r\n      over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger, went up to her and\r\n      began singing, waving his arms about.\nFirst the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they\r\n      both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of\r\n      the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with her.\r\n      They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and\r\n      shouting, while the man and woman on the stage—who represented\r\n      lovers—began smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.\nAfter her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this\r\n      seemed grotesque and amazing to Natásha. She could not follow the opera\r\n      nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the\r\n      queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in\r\n      that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but it\r\n      was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for\r\n      the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the\r\n      audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she\r\n      herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening\r\n      on the stage, and expressed delight which to Natásha seemed feigned. “I\r\n      suppose it has to be like this!” she thought. She kept looking round in\r\n      turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude\r\n      women in the boxes, especially at Hélène in the next box, who—apparently\r\n      quite unclothed—sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her eyes\r\n      off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place\r\n      and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natásha little by little began to\r\n      pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long\r\n      while. She did not realize who and where she was, nor what was going on\r\n      before her. As she looked and thought, the strangest fancies unexpectedly\r\n      and disconnectedly passed through her mind: the idea occurred to her of\r\n      jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the aria the actress was\r\n      singing, then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting\r\n      not far from her, then to lean over to Hélène and tickle her.\nAt a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a door\r\n      leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostóvs’ box creaked, and\r\n      the steps of a belated arrival were heard. “There’s Kurágin!” whispered\r\n      Shinshín. Countess Bezúkhova turned smiling to the newcomer, and Natásha,\r\n      following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally handsome\r\n      adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet courteous bearing.\r\n      This was Anatole Kurágin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at the\r\n      ball in Petersburg. He was now in an adjutant’s uniform with one epaulet\r\n      and a shoulder knot. He moved with a restrained swagger which would have\r\n      been ridiculous had he not been so good-looking and had his handsome face\r\n      not worn such an expression of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though\r\n      the performance was proceeding, he walked deliberately down the carpeted\r\n      gangway, his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed\r\n      head held high. Having looked at Natásha he approached his sister, laid\r\n      his well gloved hand on the edge of her box, nodded to her, and leaning\r\n      forward asked a question, with a motion toward Natásha.\n“Mais charmante!”said he, evidently referring to Natásha, who\r\n      did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips.\r\n      Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside\r\n      Dólokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that\r\n      Dólokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily, smiled,\r\n      and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.\n“How like the brother is to the sister,” remarked the count. “And how\r\n      handsome they both are!”\nShinshín, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue of\r\n      Kurágin’s in Moscow, and Natásha tried to overhear it just because he had\r\n      said she was“charmante.”\nThe first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about, going\r\n      out and coming in.\nBorís came to the Rostóvs’ box, received their congratulations very\r\n      simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to\r\n      Natásha and Sónya his fiancée’s invitation to her wedding, and went away.\r\n      Natásha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and congratulated on\r\n      his approaching wedding that same Borís with whom she had formerly been in\r\n      love. In the state of intoxication she was in, everything seemed simple\r\n      and natural.\nThe scantily clad Hélène smiled at everyone in the same way, and Natásha\r\n      gave Borís a similar smile.\nHélène’s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most\r\n      distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another in\r\n      their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.\nDuring the whole of that entr’acte Kurágin stood with Dólokhov in front of\r\n      the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostóvs’ box. Natásha knew he was\r\n      talking about her and this afforded her pleasure. She even turned so that\r\n      he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming\r\n      aspect. Before the beginning of the second act Pierre appeared in the\r\n      stalls. The Rostóvs had not seen him since their arrival. His face looked\r\n      sad, and he had grown still stouter since Natásha last saw him. He passed\r\n      up to the front rows, not noticing anyone. Anatole went up to him and\r\n      began speaking to him, looking at and indicating the Rostóvs’ box. On\r\n      seeing Natásha Pierre grew animated and, hastily passing between the rows,\r\n      came toward their box. When he got there he leaned on his elbows and,\r\n      smiling, talked to her for a long time. While conversing with Pierre,\r\n      Natásha heard a man’s voice in Countess Bezúkhova’s box and something told\r\n      her it was Kurágin. She turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he\r\n      gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that\r\n      it seemed strange to be so near him, to look at him like that, to be so\r\n      sure he admired her, and not to be acquainted with him.\nIn the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a\r\n      round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over\r\n      the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many\r\n      people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding\r\n      things like daggers in their hands. They began waving their arms. Then\r\n      some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been\r\n      in white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once,\r\n      but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and\r\n      behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone\r\n      knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly interrupted\r\n      by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.\nDuring this act every time Natásha looked toward the stalls she saw\r\n      Anatole Kurágin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair, staring\r\n      at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did\r\n      not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.\nWhen the second act was over Countess Bezúkhova rose, turned to the\r\n      Rostóvs’ box—her whole bosom completely exposed—beckoned the\r\n      old count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had\r\n      entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.\n“Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters,” said she. “The whole\r\n      town is singing their praises and I don’t even know them!”\nNatásha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so pleased by\r\n      praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.\n“I want to become a Moscovite too, now,” said Hélène. “How is it you’re\r\n      not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?”\nCountess Bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating\r\n      woman. She could say what she did not think—especially what was\r\n      flattering—quite simply and naturally.\n“Dear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I am not\r\n      staying here long this time—nor are you—I will try to amuse\r\n      them. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get to\r\n      know you,” said she to Natásha with her stereotyped and lovely smile. “I\r\n      had heard about you from my page, Drubetskóy. Have you heard he is getting\r\n      married? And also from my husband’s friend Bolkónski, Prince Andrew\r\n      Bolkónski,” she went on with special emphasis, implying that she knew of\r\n      his relation to Natásha. To get better acquainted she asked that one of\r\n      the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the performance,\r\n      and Natásha moved over to it.\nThe scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles were\r\n      burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls. In\r\n      the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The king waved his\r\n      right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly and sat down on a\r\n      crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white and then in light\r\n      blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the throne with her hair\r\n      down. She sang something mournfully, addressing the queen, but the king\r\n      waved his arm severely, and men and women with bare legs came in from both\r\n      sides and began dancing all together. Then the violins played very shrilly\r\n      and merrily and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms,\r\n      separating from the others, went behind the wings, adjusted her bodice,\r\n      returned to the middle of the stage, and began jumping and striking one\r\n      foot rapidly against the other. In the stalls everyone clapped and shouted\r\n      “bravo!” Then one of the men went into a corner of the stage. The cymbals\r\n      and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly, and this man with bare\r\n      legs jumped very high and waved his feet about very rapidly. (He was\r\n      Duport, who received sixty thousand rubles a year for this art.) Everybody\r\n      in the stalls, boxes, and galleries began clapping and shouting with all\r\n      their might, and the man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all\r\n      sides. Then other men and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again\r\n      shouted to the sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a\r\n      storm came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the\r\n      orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away, and\r\n      the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise and clatter\r\n      among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began shouting:\r\n      “Duport! Duport! Duport!” Natásha no longer thought this strange. She\r\n      looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.\n“Isn’t Duport delightful?” Hélène asked her.\n“Oh, yes,” replied Natásha."

    "text": "During the entr’acte a whiff of cold air came into Hélène’s box, the door\r\n      opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush against\r\n      anyone.\n“Let me introduce my brother to you,” said Hélène, her eyes shifting\r\n      uneasily from Natásha to Anatole.\nNatásha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and\r\n      smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as handsome at\r\n      close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he had\r\n      long wished to have this happiness—ever since the Narýshkins’ ball\r\n      in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing her.\r\n      Kurágin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men. He\r\n      talked boldly and naturally, and Natásha was strangely and agreeably\r\n      struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about\r\n      whom there was so much talk, but that on the contrary his smile was most\r\n      naïve, cheerful, and good-natured.\nKurágin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a\r\n      previous performance Semënova had fallen down on the stage.\n“And do you know, Countess,” he said, suddenly addressing her as an old,\r\n      familiar acquaintance, “we are getting up a costume tournament; you ought\r\n      to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at the\r\n      Karágins’! Please come! No! Really, eh?” said he.\nWhile saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face, her\r\n      neck, and her bare arms. Natásha knew for certain that he was enraptured\r\n      by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel constrained and\r\n      oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at\r\n      her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look\r\n      into hers rather than this. But looking into his eyes she was frightened,\r\n      realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt\r\n      between herself and other men. She did not know how it was that within\r\n      five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man. When\r\n      she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm\r\n      and kiss her on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt\r\n      that they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man.\r\n      Natásha kept turning to Hélène and to her father, as if asking what it all\r\n      meant, but Hélène was engaged in conversation with a general and did not\r\n      answer her look, and her father’s eyes said nothing but what they always\r\n      said: “Having a good time? Well, I’m glad of it!”\nDuring one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole’s prominent\r\n      eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natásha, to break the silence,\r\n      asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the question and blushed. She\r\n      felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing something improper.\r\n      Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.\n“At first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasantce\r\n      sont les jolies femmes, * isn’t that so? But now I like it very much\r\n      indeed,” he said, looking at her significantly. “You’ll come to the\r\n      costume tournament, Countess? Do come!” and putting out his hand to her\r\n      bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, “You will be the prettiest\r\n      there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a pledge!”\n* Are the pretty women.\nNatásha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did\r\n      himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper\r\n      intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had not\r\n      heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that he was\r\n      there, behind, so close behind her.\n“How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?” she asked\r\n      herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked straight\r\n      into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the good-natured\r\n      tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just as he was doing,\r\n      gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt with horror that no\r\n      barrier lay between him and her.\nThe curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay. Natásha went\r\n      back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive to the world she\r\n      found herself in. All that was going on before her now seemed quite\r\n      natural, but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her betrothed,\r\n      of Princess Mary, or of life in the country did not once recur to her mind\r\n      and were as if belonging to a remote past.\nIn the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm\r\n      about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared\r\n      down below. That was the only part of the fourth act that Natásha saw. She\r\n      felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was Kurágin whom she\r\n      could not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole came up\r\n      to them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was putting\r\n      Natásha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and flushed she\r\n      turned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes, smiling\r\n      tenderly.\n\nOnly after she had reached home was Natásha able clearly to think over\r\n      what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she was\r\n      horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she gave\r\n      a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.\n“O God! I am lost!” she said to herself. “How could I let him?” She sat\r\n      for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize\r\n      what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand what had\r\n      happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure, and terrible.\r\n      There in that enormous, illuminated theater where the bare-legged Duport,\r\n      in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the music on wet boards, and\r\n      young girls and old men, and the nearly naked Hélène with her proud, calm\r\n      smile, rapturously cried “bravo!”—there in the presence of that\r\n      Hélène it had all seemed clear and simple; but now, alone by herself, it\r\n      was incomprehensible. “What is it? What was that terror I felt of him?\r\n      What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?” she thought.\nOnly to the old countess at night in bed could Natásha have told all she\r\n      was feeling. She knew that Sónya with her severe and simple views would\r\n      either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a\r\n      confession. So Natásha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself.\n“Am I spoiled for Andrew’s love or not?” she asked herself, and with\r\n      soothing irony replied: “What a fool I am to ask that! What did happen to\r\n      me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn’t lead him on at all. Nobody will\r\n      know and I shall never see him again,” she told herself. “So it is plain\r\n      that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of, and Andrew\r\n      can love me still. But why ‘still?’ O God, why isn’t he here?” Natásha\r\n      quieted herself for a moment, but again some instinct told her that though\r\n      all this was true, and though nothing had happened, yet the former purity\r\n      of her love for Prince Andrew had perished. And again in imagination she\r\n      went over her whole conversation with Kurágin, and again saw the face,\r\n      gestures, and tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her\r\n      arm."

    "text": "Anatole Kurágin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him away\r\n      from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles a year\r\n      in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his creditors\r\n      demanded from his father.\nHis father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the\r\n      last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to the\r\n      commander in chief—a post his father had procured for him—and\r\n      would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to him Princess\r\n      Mary and Julie Karágina.\nAnatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre’s house.\r\n      Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him after a\r\n      while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave him money\r\n      under the guise of loans.\nAs Shinshín had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had turned\r\n      the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that he slighted\r\n      them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French actresses—with\r\n      the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to be on intimate\r\n      relations. He had never missed a carousal at Danílov’s or other Moscow\r\n      revelers’, drank whole nights through, outvying everyone else, and was at\r\n      all the balls and parties of the best society. There was talk of his\r\n      intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted with a few of them at\r\n      the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried girls, especially the\r\n      rich heiresses who were most of them plain. There was a special reason for\r\n      this, as he had got married two years before—a fact known only to\r\n      his most intimate friends. At that time while with his regiment in Poland,\r\n      a Polish landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter.\r\n      Anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and, for a payment which he\r\n      agreed to send to his father-in-law, had arranged to be free to pass\r\n      himself off as a bachelor.\nAnatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with\r\n      others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was\r\n      impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never\r\n      in his life done anything base. He was incapable of considering how his\r\n      actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or that\r\n      action of his might be. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made that\r\n      it must live in water, so God had made him such that he must spend thirty\r\n      thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in society.\r\n      He believed this so firmly that others, looking at him, were persuaded of\r\n      it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in society or money,\r\n      which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay.\nHe was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was\r\n      not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could he\r\n      be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by spoiling\r\n      his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He was not\r\n      mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared about was\r\n      gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas there was nothing\r\n      dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of considering what the\r\n      gratification of his tastes entailed for others, he honestly considered\r\n      himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues and bad people, and with\r\n      a tranquil conscience carried his head high.\nRakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence similar\r\n      to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of\r\n      forgiveness. “All will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all will\r\n      be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.”\nDólokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and his\r\n      Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and\r\n      dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kurágin and made\r\n      use of him for his own ends.\nAnatole was sincerely fond of Dólokhov for his cleverness and audacity.\r\n      Dólokhov, who needed Anatole Kurágin’s name, position, and connections as\r\n      a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made use of him and\r\n      amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it. Apart\r\n      from the advantage he derived from Anatole, the very process of dominating\r\n      another’s will was in itself a pleasure, a habit, and a necessity to\r\n      Dólokhov.\nNatásha had made a strong impression on Kurágin. At supper after the opera\r\n      he described to Dólokhov with the air of a connoisseur the attractions of\r\n      her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his intention of making\r\n      love to her. Anatole had no notion and was incapable of considering what\r\n      might come of such love-making, as he never had any notion of the outcome\r\n      of any of his actions.\n“She’s first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,” replied Dólokhov.\n“I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,” said Anatole. “Eh?”\n“You’d better wait till she’s married....”\n“You know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,” pursued\r\n      Anatole.\n“You have been caught once already by a ‘little girl,’” said Dólokhov who\r\n      knew of Kurágin’s marriage. “Take care!”\n“Well, that can’t happen twice! Eh?” said Anatole, with a good-humored\r\n      laugh."

    "text": "The day after the opera the Rostóvs went nowhere and nobody came to see\r\n      them. Márya Dmítrievna talked to the count about something which they\r\n      concealed from Natásha. Natásha guessed they were talking about the old\r\n      prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her. She\r\n      was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a\r\n      manservant to the Vozdvízhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had\r\n      not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.\r\n      To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant\r\n      recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince, and a\r\n      fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She\r\n      continually fancied that either he would never come or that something\r\n      would happen to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by\r\n      herself calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she\r\n      began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of Princess\r\n      Mary, of the theater, and of Kurágin mingled with her thoughts. The\r\n      question again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she\r\n      had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found\r\n      herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and\r\n      every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had been\r\n      able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling. To\r\n      the family Natásha seemed livelier than usual, but she was far less\r\n      tranquil and happy than before.\nOn Sunday morning Márya Dmítrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her\r\n      parish church—the Church of the Assumption built over the graves of\r\n      victims of the plague.\n“I don’t like those fashionable churches,” she said, evidently priding\r\n      herself on her independence of thought. “God is the same everywhere. We\r\n      have an excellent priest, he conducts the service decently and with\r\n      dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is there in giving\r\n      concerts in the choir? I don’t like it, it’s just self-indulgence!”\nMárya Dmítrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her whole house\r\n      was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the servants\r\n      worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church. At her table\r\n      there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had vodka and roast\r\n      goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was the holiday so\r\n      noticeable as in Márya Dmítrievna’s broad, stern face, which on that day\r\n      wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.\nAfter Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where\r\n      the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant announced\r\n      that the carriage was ready, and Márya Dmítrievna rose with a stern air.\r\n      She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and announced that\r\n      she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolkónski to have an explanation with\r\n      him about Natásha.\nAfter she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on the\r\n      Rostóvs, and Natásha, very glad of this diversion, having shut herself\r\n      into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying on the new\r\n      dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked\r\n      together, and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back\r\n      fitted, she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of her father’s\r\n      voice and another’s—a woman’s—that made her flush. It was\r\n      Hélène. Natásha had not time to take off the bodice before the door opened\r\n      and Countess Bezúkhova, dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high\r\n      collar, came into the room beaming with good-humored amiable smiles.\n“Oh, my enchantress!” she cried to the blushing Natásha. “Charming! No,\r\n      this is really beyond anything, my dear count,” said she to Count Rostóv\r\n      who had followed her in. “How can you live in Moscow and go nowhere? No, I\r\n      won’t let you off! Mademoiselle George will recite at my house tonight and\r\n      there’ll be some people, and if you don’t bring your lovely girls—who\r\n      are prettier than Mademoiselle George—I won’t know you! My husband\r\n      is away in Tver or I would send him to fetch you. You must come. You\r\n      positively must! Between eight and nine.”\nShe nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied\r\n      respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the looking\r\n      glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. She did not\r\n      cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising Natásha’s\r\n      beauty. She looked at Natásha’s dresses and praised them, as well as a new\r\n      dress of her own made of “metallic gauze,” which she had received from\r\n      Paris, and advised Natásha to have one like it.\n“But anything suits you, my charmer!” she remarked.\nA smile of pleasure never left Natásha’s face. She felt happy and as if\r\n      she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess Bezúkhova who\r\n      had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now so\r\n      kind to her. Natásha brightened up and felt almost in love with this\r\n      woman, who was so beautiful and so kind. Hélène for her part was sincerely\r\n      delighted with Natásha and wished to give her a good time. Anatole had\r\n      asked her to bring him and Natásha together, and she was calling on the\r\n      Rostóvs for that purpose. The idea of throwing her brother and Natásha\r\n      together amused her.\nThough at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Natásha for\r\n      drawing Borís away, she did not think of that now, and in her own way\r\n      heartily wished Natásha well. As she was leaving the Rostóvs she called\r\n      her protégée aside.\n“My brother dined with me yesterday—we nearly died of laughter—he\r\n      ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite\r\n      madly, in love with you, my dear.”\nNatásha blushed scarlet when she heard this.\n“How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!” said Hélène. “You must\r\n      certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a reason to\r\n      shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your fiancé would\r\n      wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death.”\n“So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre—that good\r\n      Pierre—have talked and laughed about this. So it’s all right.” And\r\n      again, under Hélène’s influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed\r\n      simple and natural. “And she is such agrande dame, so kind, and\r\n      evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?” thought Natásha,\r\n      gazing at Hélène with wide-open, wondering eyes.\nMárya Dmítrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having\r\n      evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince’s. She was still too\r\n      agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly. In\r\n      answer to the count’s inquiries she replied that things were all right and\r\n      that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of Countess Bezúkhova’s\r\n      visit and the invitation for that evening, Márya Dmítrievna remarked:\n“I don’t care to have anything to do with Bezúkhova and don’t advise you\r\n      to; however, if you’ve promised—go. It will divert your thoughts,”\r\n       she added, addressing Natásha."

    "text": "Count Rostóv took the girls to Countess Bezúkhova’s. There were a good\r\n      many people there, but nearly all strangers to Natásha. Count Rostóv was\r\n      displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and\r\n      women known for the freedom of their conduct. Mademoiselle George was\r\n      standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men. There\r\n      were several Frenchmen present, among them Métivier who from the time\r\n      Hélène reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house. The count decided\r\n      not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and to get away\r\n      as soon as Mademoiselle George’s performance was over.\nAnatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the Rostóvs.\r\n      Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natásha and followed\r\n      her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had had\r\n      at the opera—gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at\r\n      the absence of a moral barrier between them.\nHélène welcomed Natásha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her\r\n      beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went\r\n      out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people began\r\n      arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a chair for\r\n      Natásha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count, who never\r\n      lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down behind her.\nMademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl\r\n      draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and\r\n      assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was audible.\nMademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and began\r\n      reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her son. In\r\n      some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered, lifting her\r\n      head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse sounds, rolling\r\n      her eyes.\n“Adorable! divine! delicious!” was heard from every side.\nNatásha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor\r\n      understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself\r\n      again completely borne away into this strange senseless world—so\r\n      remote from her old world—a world in which it was impossible to know\r\n      what was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole, and\r\n      conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of\r\n      expectancy.\nAfter the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded\r\n      Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.\n“How beautiful she is!” Natásha remarked to her father who had also risen\r\n      and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.\n“I don’t think so when I look at you!” said Anatole, following Natásha. He\r\n      said this at a moment when she alone could hear him. “You are\r\n      enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased...”\n“Come, come, Natásha!” said the count, as he turned back for his daughter.\r\n      “How beautiful she is!” Natásha without saying anything stepped up to her\r\n      father and looked at him with surprised inquiring eyes.\nAfter giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and Countess\r\n      Bezúkhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.\nThe count wished to go home, but Hélène entreated him not to spoil her\r\n      improvised ball, and the Rostóvs stayed on. Anatole asked Natásha for a\r\n      valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she\r\n      was bewitching and that he loved her. During theécossaise, which she also\r\n      danced with him, Anatole said nothing when they happened to be by\r\n      themselves, but merely gazed at her. Natásha lifted her frightened eyes to\r\n      him, but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look and\r\n      smile that she could not, whilst looking at him, say what she had to say.\r\n      She lowered her eyes.\n“Don’t say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,” she said\r\n      rapidly.... She glanced at him.\nAnatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.\n“Don’t speak to me of that! What can I do?” said he. “I tell you I am\r\n      madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are enchanting?...\r\n      It’s our turn to begin.”\nNatásha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open frightened\r\n      eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly anything that\r\n      went on that evening. They danced theécossaiseand theGrossvater.Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain. Wherever she went\r\n      and whomever she was speaking to, she felthiseyes upon her. Later on she\r\n      recalled how she had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room\r\n      to rearrange her dress, that Hélène had followed her and spoken laughingly\r\n      of her brother’s love, and that she again met Anatole in the little\r\n      sitting room. Hélène had disappeared leaving them alone, and Anatole had\r\n      taken her hand and said in a tender voice:\n“I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see you?\r\n      I love you madly. Can I never...?” and, blocking her path, he brought his\r\n      face close to hers.\nHis large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw\r\n      nothing but them.\n“Natalie?” he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being\r\n      painfully pressed. “Natalie?”\n“I don’t understand. I have nothing to say,” her eyes replied.\nBurning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she felt\r\n      herself released, and Hélène’s footsteps and the rustle of her dress were\r\n      heard in the room. Natásha looked round at her, and then, red and\r\n      trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved toward\r\n      the door.\n“One word, just one, for God’s sake!” cried Anatole.\nShe paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what\r\n      had happened and to which she could find no answer.\n“Natalie, just a word, only one!” he kept repeating, evidently not knowing\r\n      what to say and he repeated it till Hélène came up to them.\nHélène returned with Natásha to the drawing room. The Rostóvs went away\r\n      without staying for supper.\nAfter reaching home Natásha did not sleep all night. She was tormented by\r\n      the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew. She\r\n      loved Prince Andrew—she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved\r\n      him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. “Else how\r\n      could all this have happened?” thought she. “If, after that, I could\r\n      return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to\r\n      that, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is kind,\r\n      noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I to do if I\r\n      love him and the other one too?” she asked herself, unable to find an\r\n      answer to these terrible questions."

    "text": "Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began to move\r\n      about and talk, dressmakers came again. Márya Dmítrievna appeared, and\r\n      they were called to breakfast. Natásha kept looking uneasily at everybody\r\n      with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept every glance directed\r\n      toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.\nAfter breakfast, which was her best time, Márya Dmítrievna sat down in her\r\n      armchair and called Natásha and the count to her.\n“Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my\r\n      advice,” she began. “Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince\r\n      Bolkónski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to\r\n      begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had to\r\n      say!”\n“Well, and he?” asked the count.\n“He? He’s crazy... he did not want to listen. But what’s the use of\r\n      talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,” said Márya Dmítrievna.\r\n      “My advice to you is finish your business and go back home to Otrádnoe...\r\n      and wait there.”\n“Oh, no!” exclaimed Natásha.\n“Yes, go back,” said Márya Dmítrievna, “and wait there. If your betrothed\r\n      comes here now—there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but alone with\r\n      the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you.”\nCount Rostóv approved of this suggestion, appreciating its reasonableness.\r\n      If the old man came round it would be all the better to visit him in\r\n      Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding, against his\r\n      wishes, could only be arranged at Otrádnoe.\n“That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took her,”\r\n       said the old count.\n“No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he\r\n      won’t—that’s his affair,” said Márya Dmítrievna, looking for\r\n      something in her reticule. “Besides, the trousseau is ready, so there is\r\n      nothing to wait for; and what is not ready I’ll send after you. Though I\r\n      don’t like letting you go, it is the best way. So go, with God’s\r\n      blessing!”\nHaving found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to\r\n      Natásha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.\n“She has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She’s\r\n      afraid you might think that she does not like you.”\n“But she doesn’t like me,” said Natásha.\n“Don’t talk nonsense!” cried Márya Dmítrievna.\n“I shan’t believe anyone, I know she doesn’t like me,” replied Natásha\r\n      boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold and angry\r\n      resolution that caused Márya Dmítrievna to look at her more intently and\r\n      to frown.\n“Don’t answer like that, my good girl!” she said.\r\n      “What I say is true! Write an answer!”\nNatásha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess Mary’s letter.\nPrincess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that\r\n      had occurred between them. Whatever her father’s feelings might be, she\r\n      begged Natásha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one\r\n      chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice\r\n      everything.\n“Do not think, however,” she wrote, “that my father is ill-disposed toward\r\n      you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven; but he is good\r\n      and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy.” Princess Mary\r\n      went on to ask Natásha to fix a time when she could see her again.\nAfter reading the letter Natásha sat down at the writing table to answer\r\n      it. “Dear Princess,” she wrote in French quickly and mechanically, and\r\n      then paused. What more could she write after all that had happened the\r\n      evening before? “Yes, yes! All that has happened, and now all is changed,”\r\n       she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her. “Must I\r\n      break off with him? Must I really? That’s awful...” and to escape from\r\n      these dreadful thoughts she went to Sónya and began sorting patterns with\r\n      her.\nAfter dinner Natásha went to her room and again took up Princess Mary’s\r\n      letter. “Can it be that it is all over?” she thought. “Can it be that all\r\n      this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before?” She\r\n      recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former strength, and at the\r\n      same time felt that she loved Kurágin. She vividly pictured herself as\r\n      Prince Andrew’s wife, and the scenes of happiness with him she had so\r\n      often repeated in her imagination, and at the same time, aglow with\r\n      excitement, recalled every detail of yesterday’s interview with Anatole.\n“Why could that not be as well?” she sometimes asked herself in complete\r\n      bewilderment. “Only so could I be completely happy; but now I have to\r\n      choose, and I can’t be happy without either of them. Only,” she thought,\r\n      “to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both\r\n      equally impossible. But withthat onenothing is spoiled. But am I really\r\n      to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew’s love, in which I have lived\r\n      so long?”\n“Please, Miss!” whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air.\r\n      “A man told me to give you this—” and she handed Natásha a letter.\n“Only, for Christ’s sake...” the girl went on, as Natásha, without\r\n      thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from Anatole,\r\n      of which, without taking in a word, she understood only that it was a\r\n      letter from him—from the man she loved. Yes, she loved him, or else\r\n      how could that have happened which had happened? And how could she have a\r\n      love letter from him in her hand?\nWith trembling hands Natásha held that passionate love letter which\r\n      Dólokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she found in it an\r\n      echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.\n“Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you or to\r\n      die. There is no other way for me,” the letter began. Then he went on to\r\n      say that he knew her parents would not give her to him—for this\r\n      there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her—but that if\r\n      she loved him she need only say the wordyes, and no human power could\r\n      hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and\r\n      carry her off to the ends of the earth.\n“Yes, yes! I love him!” thought Natásha, reading the letter for the\r\n      twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of\r\n      it.\nThat evening Márya Dmítrievna was going to the Akhárovs’ and proposed to\r\n      take the girls with her. Natásha, pleading a headache, remained at home."

    "text": "On returning late in the evening Sónya went to Natásha’s room, and to her\r\n      surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open on the\r\n      table, beside her lay Anatole’s letter. Sónya picked it up and read it.\nAs she read she glanced at the sleeping Natásha, trying to find in her\r\n      face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find it. Her face\r\n      was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep herself from\r\n      choking, Sónya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat down in an\r\n      armchair and burst into tears.\n“How was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have left\r\n      off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kurágin go to such\r\n      lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that’s plain! What will Nicholas,\r\n      dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is the meaning of her\r\n      excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before yesterday, yesterday, and\r\n      today,” thought Sónya. “But it can’t be that she loves him! She probably\r\n      opened the letter without knowing who it was from. Probably she is\r\n      offended by it. She could not do such a thing!”\nSónya wiped away her tears and went up to Natásha, again scanning her\r\n      face.\n“Natásha!” she said, just audibly.\nNatásha awoke and saw Sónya.\n“Ah, you’re back?”\nAnd with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of\r\n      awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing Sónya’s look of\r\n      embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.\n“Sónya, you’ve read that letter?” she demanded.\n“Yes,” answered Sónya softly.\nNatásha smiled rapturously.\n“No, Sónya, I can’t any longer!” she said. “I can’t hide it from you any\r\n      longer. You know, we love one another! Sónya, darling, he writes...\r\n      Sónya...”\nSónya stared open-eyed at Natásha, unable to believe her ears.\n“And Bolkónski?” she asked.\n“Ah, Sónya, if you only knew how happy I am!” cried Natásha. “You don’t\r\n      know what love is....”\n“But, Natásha, canthatbe all over?”\nNatásha looked at Sónya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp the\r\n      question.\n“Well, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?” said Sónya.\n“Oh, you don’t understand anything! Don’t talk nonsense, just listen!”\r\n       said Natásha, with momentary vexation.\n“But I can’t believe it,” insisted Sónya. “I don’t understand. How is it\r\n      you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly... Why, you have only\r\n      seen him three times! Natásha, I don’t believe you, you’re joking! In\r\n      three days to forget everything and so...”\n“Three days?” said Natásha. “It seems to me I’ve loved him a hundred\r\n      years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You can’t\r\n      understand it.... Sónya, wait a bit, sit here,” and Natásha embraced and\r\n      kissed her.\n“I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it too,\r\n      but it’s only now that I feel such love. It’s not the same as before. As\r\n      soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave, and that I\r\n      could not help loving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders I shall do.\r\n      You don’t understand that. What can I do? What can I do, Sónya?” cried\r\n      Natásha with a happy yet frightened expression.\n“But think what you are doing,” cried Sónya. “I can’t leave it like this.\r\n      This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so far?” she went\r\n      on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.\n“I told you that I have no will,” Natásha replied. “Why can’t you\r\n      understand? I love him!”\n“Then I won’t let it come to that... I shall tell!” cried Sónya, bursting\r\n      into tears.\n“What do you mean? For God’s sake... If you tell, you are my enemy!”\r\n       declared Natásha. “You want me to be miserable, you want us to be\r\n      separated....”\nWhen she saw Natásha’s fright, Sónya shed tears of shame and pity for her\r\n      friend.\n“But what has happened between you?” she asked. “What has he said to you?\r\n      Why doesn’t he come to the house?”\nNatásha did not answer her questions.\n“For God’s sake, Sónya, don’t tell anyone, don’t torture me,” Natásha\r\n      entreated. “Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters! I have\r\n      confided in you....”\n“But why this secrecy? Why doesn’t he come to the house?” asked Sónya.\r\n      “Why doesn’t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince Andrew gave you\r\n      complete freedom—if it is really so; but I don’t believe it!\r\n      Natásha, have you considered what thesesecret reasonscan be?”\nNatásha looked at Sónya with astonishment. Evidently this question\r\n      presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how\r\n      to answer it.\n“I don’t know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!”\nSónya sighed and shook her head incredulously.\n“If there were reasons...” she began.\nBut Natásha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.\n“Sónya, one can’t doubt him! One can’t, one can’t! Don’t you understand?”\r\n       she cried.\n“Does he love you?”\n“Does he love me?” Natásha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend’s\r\n      lack of comprehension. “Why, you have read his letter and you have seen\r\n      him.”\n“But if he is dishonorable?”\n“He!dishonorable? If you only knew!” exclaimed Natásha.\n“If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or\r\n      cease seeing you; and if you won’t do this, I will. I will write to him,\r\n      and I will tell Papa!” said Sónya resolutely.\n“But I can’t live without him!” cried Natásha.\n“Natásha, I don’t understand you. And what are you saying! Think of your\r\n      father and of Nicholas.”\n“I don’t want anyone, I don’t love anyone but him. How dare you say he is\r\n      dishonorable? Don’t you know that I love him?” screamed Natásha. “Go away,\r\n      Sónya! I don’t want to quarrel with you, but go, for God’s sake go! You\r\n      see how I am suffering!” Natásha cried angrily, in a voice of despair and\r\n      repressed irritation. Sónya burst into sobs and ran from the room.\nNatásha went to the table and without a moment’s reflection wrote that\r\n      answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the\r\n      morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings\r\n      were at an end; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince Andrew\r\n      who when he went abroad had given her her freedom, she begged Princess\r\n      Mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward\r\n      her, but that she could not be his wife. At that moment this all seemed\r\n      quite easy, simple, and clear to Natásha.\n\nOn Friday the Rostóvs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday the\r\n      count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.\nOn the day the count left, Sónya and Natásha were invited to a big dinner\r\n      party at the Karágins’, and Márya Dmítrievna took them there. At that\r\n      party Natásha again met Anatole, and Sónya noticed that she spoke to him,\r\n      trying not to be overheard, and that all through dinner she was more\r\n      agitated than ever. When they got home Natásha was the first to begin the\r\n      explanation Sónya expected.\n“There, Sónya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,” Natásha\r\n      began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised.\r\n      “We have had an explanation today.”\n“Well, what happened? What did he say? Natásha, how glad I am you’re not\r\n      angry with me! Tell me everything—the whole truth. What did he say?”\nNatásha became thoughtful.\n“Oh, Sónya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I had\r\n      promised Bolkónski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.”\nSónya sighed sorrowfully.\n“But you haven’t refused Bolkónski?” said she.\n“Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkónski. Why do you\r\n      think so badly of me?”\n“I don’t think anything, only I don’t understand this...”\n“Wait a bit, Sónya, you’ll understand everything. You’ll see what a man he\r\n      is! Now don’t think badly of me or of him. I don’t think badly of anyone:\r\n      I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?”\nSónya did not succumb to the tender tone Natásha used toward her. The more\r\n      emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natásha’s face became, the\r\n      more serious and stern grew Sónya’s.\n“Natásha,” said she, “you asked me not to speak to you, and I haven’t\r\n      spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don’t trust him, Natásha. Why\r\n      this secrecy?”\n“Again, again!” interrupted Natásha.\n“Natásha, I am afraid for you!”\n“Afraid of what?”\n“I am afraid you’re going to your ruin,” said Sónya resolutely, and was\r\n      herself horrified at what she had said.\nAnger again showed in Natásha’s face.\n“And I’ll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It’s not your\r\n      business! It won’t be you, but I, who’ll suffer. Leave me alone, leave me\r\n      alone! I hate you!”\n“Natásha!” moaned Sónya, aghast.\n“I hate you, I hate you! You’re my enemy forever!” And Natásha ran out of\r\n      the room.\nNatásha did not speak to Sónya again and avoided her. With the same\r\n      expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house, taking\r\n      up now one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.\nHard as it was for Sónya, she watched her friend and did not let her out\r\n      of her sight.\nThe day before the count was to return, Sónya noticed that Natásha sat by\r\n      the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and that\r\n      she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom Sónya took to be\r\n      Anatole.\nSónya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at\r\n      dinner and all that evening Natásha was in a strange and unnatural state.\r\n      She answered questions at random, began sentences she did not finish, and\r\n      laughed at everything.\nAfter tea Sónya noticed a housemaid at Natásha’s door timidly waiting to\r\n      let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at the door\r\n      learned that another letter had been delivered.\nThen suddenly it became clear to Sónya that Natásha had some dreadful plan\r\n      for that evening. Sónya knocked at her door. Natásha did not let her in.\n“She will run away with him!” thought Sónya. “She is capable of anything.\r\n      There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today.\r\n      She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,” Sónya remembered. “Yes, that’s\r\n      it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?” thought she,\r\n      recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Natásha had some\r\n      terrible intention. “The count is away. What am I to do? Write to Kurágin\r\n      demanding an explanation? But what is there to oblige him to reply? Write\r\n      to Pierre, as Prince Andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But\r\n      perhaps she really has already refused Bolkónski—she sent a letter\r\n      to Princess Mary yesterday. And Uncle is away....” To tell Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna who had such faith in Natásha seemed to Sónya terrible. “Well,\r\n      anyway,” thought Sónya as she stood in the dark passage, “now or never I\r\n      must prove that I remember the family’s goodness to me and that I love\r\n      Nicholas. Yes! If I don’t sleep for three nights I’ll not leave this\r\n      passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family be\r\n      disgraced,” thought she."

    "text": "Anatole had lately moved to Dólokhov’s. The plan for Natalie Rostóva’s\r\n      abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by Dólokhov a few\r\n      days before, and on the day that Sónya, after listening at Natásha’s door,\r\n      resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been put into execution. Natásha\r\n      had promised to come out to Kurágin at the back porch at ten that evening.\r\n      Kurágin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her\r\n      forty miles to the village of Kámenka, where an unfrocked priest was in\r\n      readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them. At Kámenka a relay of\r\n      horses was to wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from\r\n      there they would hasten abroad with post horses.\nAnatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles he\r\n      had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with\r\n      Dólokhov’s help.\nTwo witnesses for the mock marriage—Khvóstikov, a retired petty\r\n      official whom Dólokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and\r\n      Makárin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded\r\n      affection for Kurágin—were sitting at tea in Dólokhov’s front room.\nIn his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with\r\n      Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dólokhov in a traveling cloak\r\n      and high boots, at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles of\r\n      paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from the\r\n      room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room\r\n      behind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his\r\n      things. Dólokhov was counting the money and noting something down.\n“Well,” he said, “Khvóstikov must have two thousand.”\n“Give it to him, then,” said Anatole.\n“Makárka” (their name for Makárin) “will go through fire and water for you\r\n      for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,” said Dólokhov, showing\r\n      him the memorandum. “Is that right?”\n“Yes, of course,” returned Anatole, evidently not listening to Dólokhov\r\n      and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face.\nDólokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an\r\n      ironic smile:\n“Do you know? You’d really better drop it all. There’s still time!”\n“Fool,” retorted Anatole. “Don’t talk nonsense! If you only knew... it’s\r\n      the devil knows what!”\n“No, really, give it up!” said Dólokhov. “I am speaking seriously. It’s no\r\n      joke, this plot you’ve hatched.”\n“What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?” said Anatole, making a\r\n      grimace. “Really it’s no time for your stupid jokes,” and he left the\r\n      room.\nDólokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone\r\n      out.\n“You wait a bit,” he called after him. “I’m not joking, I’m talking sense.\r\n      Come here, come here!”\nAnatole returned and looked at Dólokhov, trying to give him his attention\r\n      and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.\n“Now listen to me. I’m telling you this for the last time. Why should I\r\n      joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for you? Who\r\n      found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I did it\r\n      all.”\n“Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?” And Anatole\r\n      sighed and embraced Dólokhov.\n“I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a\r\n      dangerous business, and if you think about it—a stupid business.\r\n      Well, you’ll carry her off—all right! Will they let it stop at that?\r\n      It will come out that you’re already married. Why, they’ll have you in the\r\n      criminal court....”\n“Oh, nonsense, nonsense!” Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace.\r\n      “Didn’t I explain to you? What?” And Anatole, with the partiality\r\n      dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own\r\n      reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to Dólokhov a hundred\r\n      times. “Didn’t I explain to you that I have come to this conclusion: if\r\n      this marriage is invalid,” he went on, crooking one finger, “then I have\r\n      nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no matter! Abroad no one will\r\n      know anything about it. Isn’t that so? And don’t talk to me, don’t,\r\n      don’t.”\n“Seriously, you’d better drop it! You’ll only get yourself into a mess!”\n“Go to the devil!” cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the room,\r\n      but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of Dólokhov\r\n      with his feet turned under him. “It’s the very devil! What? Feel how it\r\n      beats!” He took Dólokhov’s hand and put it on his heart. “What a foot, my\r\n      dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!” he added in French. “What?”\nDólokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes\r\n      looked at him—evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of\r\n      him.\n“Well and when the money’s gone, what then?”\n“What then? Eh?” repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a thought of the\r\n      future. “What then?... Then, I don’t know.... But why talk nonsense!” He\r\n      glanced at his watch. “It’s time!”\nAnatole went into the back room.\n“Now then! Nearly ready? You’re dawdling!” he shouted to the servants.\nDólokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring\r\n      something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into the\r\n      room where Khvóstikov and Makárin were sitting.\nAnatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling\r\n      pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself.\n“Come and eat something. Have a drink!” Dólokhov shouted to him from the\r\n      other room.\n“I don’t want to,” answered Anatole continuing to smile.\n“Come! Balagá is here.”\nAnatole rose and went into the dining room. Balagá was a famous troyka\r\n      driver who had known Dólokhov and Anatole some six years and had given\r\n      them good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole’s regiment\r\n      was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the evening, brought\r\n      him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again the next night. More\r\n      than once he had enabled Dólokhov to escape when pursued. More than once\r\n      he had driven them through the town with gypsies and “ladykins” as he\r\n      called the cocottes. More than once in their service he had run over\r\n      pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow and had always\r\n      been protected from the consequences by “my gentlemen” as he called them.\r\n      He had ruined more than one horse in their service. More than once they\r\n      had beaten him, and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne\r\n      and Madeira, which he loved; and he knew more than one thing about each of\r\n      them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia. They often\r\n      called Balagá into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the\r\n      gypsies’, and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed\r\n      through his hands. In their service he risked his skin and his life twenty\r\n      times a year, and in their service had lost more horses than the money he\r\n      had from them would buy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at\r\n      twelve miles an hour, liked upsetting a driver or running down a\r\n      pedestrian, and flying at full gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked\r\n      to hear those wild, tipsy shouts behind him: “Get on! Get on!” when it was\r\n      impossible to go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to\r\n      some peasant who, more dead than alive, was already hurrying out of his\r\n      way. “Real gentlemen!” he considered them.\nAnatole and Dólokhov liked Balagá too for his masterly driving and because\r\n      he liked the things they liked. With others Balagá bargained, charging\r\n      twenty-five rubles for a two hours’ drive, and rarely drove himself,\r\n      generally letting his young men do so. But with “his gentlemen” he always\r\n      drove himself and never demanded anything for his work. Only a couple of\r\n      times a year—when he knew from their valets that they had money in\r\n      hand—he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow\r\n      would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always made him sit down.\n“Do help me out, Theodore Iványch, sir,” or “your excellency,” he would\r\n      say. “I am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to go to the\r\n      fair.”\nAnd Anatole and Dólokhov, when they had money, would give him a thousand\r\n      or a couple of thousand rubles.\nBalagá was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about\r\n      twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, glittering\r\n      little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, dark-blue, silk-lined\r\n      cloth coat over a sheepskin.\nOn entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front\r\n      corner of the room, and went up to Dólokhov, holding out a small, black\r\n      hand.\n“Theodore Iványch!” he said, bowing.\n“How d’you do, friend? Well, here he is!”\n“Good day, your excellency!” he said, again holding out his hand to\r\n      Anatole who had just come in.\n“I say, Balagá,” said Anatole, putting his hands on the man’s shoulders,\r\n      “do you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service.... What horses have\r\n      you come with? Eh?”\n“As your messenger ordered, your special beasts,” replied Balagá.\n“Well, listen, Balagá! Drive all three to death but get me there in three\r\n      hours. Eh?”\n“When they are dead, what shall I drive?” said Balagá with a wink.\n“Mind, I’ll smash your face in! Don’t make jokes!” cried Anatole, suddenly\r\n      rolling his eyes.\n“Why joke?” said the driver, laughing. “As if I’d grudge my gentlemen\r\n      anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast we’ll go!”\n“Ah!” said Anatole. “Well, sit down.”\n“Yes, sit down!” said Dólokhov.\n“I’ll stand, Theodore Iványch.”\n“Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!” said Anatole, and filled a large glass\r\n      of Madeira for him.\nThe driver’s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing it for\r\n      manners’ sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk\r\n      handkerchief he took out of his cap.\n“And when are we to start, your excellency?”\n“Well...” Anatole looked at his watch. “We’ll start at once. Mind, Balagá!\r\n      You’ll get there in time? Eh?”\n“That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn’t we be there in\r\n      time?” replied Balagá. “Didn’t we get you to Tver in seven hours? I think\r\n      you remember that, your excellency?”\n“Do you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,” said Anatole, smilingly at\r\n      the recollection and turning to Makárin who gazed rapturously at him with\r\n      wide-open eyes. “Will you believe it, Makárka, it took one’s breath away,\r\n      the rate we flew. We came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right\r\n      over two of them. Eh?”\n“Those were horses!” Balagá continued the tale. “That time I’d harnessed\r\n      two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,” he went on, turning to\r\n      Dólokhov. “Will you believe it, Theodore Iványch, those animals flew forty\r\n      miles? I couldn’t hold them in, my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so\r\n      that I threw down the reins—‘Catch hold yourself, your excellency!’\r\n      says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there.\r\n      It wasn’t a case of urging them on, there was no holding them in till we\r\n      reached the place. The devils took us there in three hours! Only the near\r\n      one died of it.”"

    "text": "Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a\r\n      fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one side\r\n      and very becoming to his handsome face. Having looked in a mirror, and\r\n      standing before Dólokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it, he\r\n      lifted a glass of wine.\n“Well, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!” said\r\n      Anatole. “Well, comrades and friends...” he considered for a\r\n      moment “... of my youth, farewell!” he said, turning to Makárin and the others.\nThough they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to make\r\n      something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades. He\r\n      spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed\r\n      one leg.\n“All take glasses; you too, Balagá. Well, comrades and friends of my\r\n      youth, we’ve had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when shall\r\n      we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good time—now\r\n      farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...” he cried, and emptying his\r\n      glass flung it on the floor.\n“To your health!” said Balagá who also emptied his glass, and wiped his\r\n      mouth with his handkerchief.\nMakárin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.\n“Ah, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!\n“Let’s go. Let’s go!” cried Anatole.\nBalagá was about to leave the room.\n“No, stop!” said Anatole. “Shut the door; we have first to sit down.\r\n      That’s the way.”\nThey shut the door and all sat down.\n“Now, quick march, lads!” said Anatole, rising.\nJoseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all went\r\n      out into the vestibule.\n“And where’s the fur cloak?” asked Dólokhov. “Hey, Ignátka! Go to Matrëna\r\n      Matrévna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what elopements are\r\n      like,” continued Dólokhov with a wink. “Why, she’ll rush out more dead\r\n      than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay at all there’ll\r\n      be tears and ‘Papa’ and ‘Mamma,’ and she’s frozen in a minute and must go\r\n      back—but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her\r\n      to the sleigh.”\nThe valet brought a woman’s fox-lined cloak.\n“Fool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matrëna, the sable!” he shouted so\r\n      that his voice rang far through the rooms.\nA handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and\r\n      curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable mantle on\r\n      her arm.\n“Here, I don’t grudge it—take it!” she said, evidently afraid of her\r\n      master and yet regretful of her cloak.\nDólokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over Matrëna, and\r\n      wrapped her up in it.\n“That’s the way,” said Dólokhov, “and then so!” and he turned the collar\r\n      up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered. “And then\r\n      so, do you see?” and he pushed Anatole’s head forward to meet the gap left\r\n      by the collar, through which Matrëna’s brilliant smile was seen.\n“Well, good-by, Matrëna,” said Anatole, kissing her. “Ah, my revels here\r\n      are over. Remember me to Stëshka. There, good-by! Good-by, Matrëna, wish\r\n      me luck!”\n“Well, Prince, may God give you great luck!” said Matrëna in her gypsy\r\n      accent.\nTwo troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were\r\n      holding the horses. Balagá took his seat in the front one and holding his\r\n      elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and Dólokhov got in\r\n      with him. Makárin, Khvóstikov, and a valet seated themselves in the other\r\n      sleigh.\n“Well, are you ready?” asked Balagá.\n“Go!” he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka tore\r\n      down the Nikítski Boulevard.\n“Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...” The shouting of Balagá and\r\n      of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard.\r\n      On the Arbát Square the troyka caught against a carriage; something\r\n      cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the Arbát Street.\nAfter taking a turn along the Podnovínski Boulevard, Balagá began to rein\r\n      in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old Konyúsheny Street.\nThe young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole and\r\n      Dólokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the gate Dólokhov\r\n      whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.\n“Come into the courtyard or you’ll be seen; she’ll come out directly,”\r\n       said she.\nDólokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the courtyard,\r\n      turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.\nHe was met by Gabriel, Márya Dmítrievna’s gigantic footman.\n“Come to the mistress, please,” said the footman in his deep bass,\r\n      intercepting any retreat.\n“To what Mistress? Who are you?” asked Anatole in a breathless whisper.\n“Kindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.”\n“Kurágin! Come back!” shouted Dólokhov. “Betrayed! Back!”\nDólokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and was\r\n      struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With a last\r\n      desperate effort Dólokhov pushed the porter aside, and when Anatole ran\r\n      back seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket, and ran back\r\n      with him to the troyka."

    "text": "Márya Dmítrievna, having found Sónya weeping in the corridor, made her\r\n      confess everything, and intercepting the note to Natásha she read it and\r\n      went into Natásha’s room with it in her hand.\n“You shameless good-for-nothing!” said she. “I won’t hear a word.”\nPushing back Natásha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes,\r\n      she locked her in; and having given orders to the yard porter to admit the\r\n      persons who would be coming that evening, but not to let them out again,\r\n      and having told the footman to bring them up to her, she seated herself in\r\n      the drawing room to await the abductors.\nWhen Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away\r\n      again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced through\r\n      the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward midnight she\r\n      went to Natásha’s room fingering the key in her pocket. Sónya was sitting\r\n      sobbing in the corridor. “Márya Dmítrievna, for God’s sake let me in to\r\n      her!” she pleaded, but Márya Dmítrievna unlocked the door and went in\r\n      without giving her an answer.... “Disgusting, abominable... In my house...\r\n      horrid girl, hussy! I’m only sorry for her father!” thought she, trying to\r\n      restrain her wrath. “Hard as it may be, I’ll tell them all to hold their\r\n      tongues and will hide it from the count.” She entered the room with\r\n      resolute steps. Natásha lying on the sofa, her head hidden in her hands,\r\n      and she did not stir. She was in just the same position in which Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna had left her.\n“A nice girl! Very nice!” said Márya Dmítrievna. “Arranging meetings with\r\n      lovers in my house! It’s no use pretending: you listen when I speak to\r\n      you!” And Márya Dmítrievna touched her arm. “Listen when I speak! You’ve\r\n      disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I’d treat you differently,\r\n      but I’m sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.”\nNatásha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved with\r\n      noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. Márya Dmítrievna glanced\r\n      round at Sónya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natásha.\n“It’s lucky for him that he escaped me; but I’ll find him!” she said in\r\n      her rough voice. “Do you hear what I am saying or not?” she added.\nShe put her large hand under Natásha’s face and turned it toward her. Both\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna and Sónya were amazed when they saw how Natásha looked.\r\n      Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her cheeks sunken.\n“Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!” she muttered, wrenching\r\n      herself from Márya Dmítrievna’s hands with a vicious effort and sinking\r\n      down again into her former position.\n“Natalie!” said Márya Dmítrievna. “I wish for your good. Lie still, stay\r\n      like that then, I won’t touch you. But listen. I won’t tell you how guilty\r\n      you are. You know that yourself. But when your father comes back tomorrow\r\n      what am I to tell him? Eh?”\nAgain Natásha’s body shook with sobs.\n“Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?”\n“I have no betrothed: I have refused him!” cried Natásha.\n“That’s all the same,” continued Márya Dmítrievna. “If they hear of this,\r\n      will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he challenges him\r\n      to a duel will that be all right? Eh?”\n“Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked you\r\n      to?” shouted Natásha, raising herself on the sofa and looking malignantly\r\n      at Márya Dmítrievna.\n“But what did you want?” cried Márya Dmítrievna, growing angry again.\r\n      “Were you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the house?\r\n      Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he\r\n      had carried you off... do you think they wouldn’t have found him? Your\r\n      father, or brother, or your betrothed? And he’s a scoundrel, a wretch—that’s\r\n      a fact!”\n“He is better than any of you!” exclaimed Natásha getting up. “If you\r\n      hadn’t interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? Sónya,\r\n      why?... Go away!”\nAnd she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people\r\n      bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna was to speak again but Natásha cried out:\n“Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!” and she threw herself\r\n      back on the sofa.\nMárya Dmítrievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on her\r\n      that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody\r\n      would know anything about it if only Natásha herself would undertake to\r\n      forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened. Natásha\r\n      did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she grew cold and had a\r\n      shivering fit. Márya Dmítrievna put a pillow under her head, covered her\r\n      with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower water, but\r\n      Natásha did not respond to her.\n“Well, let her sleep,” said Márya Dmítrievna as she went out of the room\r\n      supposing Natásha to be asleep.\nBut Natásha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she\r\n      looked straight before her. All that night she did not sleep or weep and\r\n      did not speak to Sónya who got up and went to her several times.\nNext day Count Rostóv returned from his estate near Moscow in time for\r\n      lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the affair with the\r\n      purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was nothing to keep him\r\n      any longer in Moscow, away from the countess whom he missed. Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna met him and told him that Natásha had been very unwell the day\r\n      before and that they had sent for the doctor, but that she was better now.\r\n      Natásha had not left her room that morning. With compressed and parched\r\n      lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily watching the\r\n      people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered\r\n      the room. She was evidently expecting news of him and that he would come\r\n      or would write to her.\nWhen the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound of\r\n      a man’s footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent\r\n      expression. She did not even get up to greet him. “What is the matter with\r\n      you, my angel? Are you ill?” asked the count.\nAfter a moment’s silence Natásha answered: “Yes, ill.”\nIn reply to the count’s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected\r\n      and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him that\r\n      nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. Márya Dmítrievna\r\n      confirmed Natásha’s assurances that nothing had happened. From the\r\n      pretense of illness, from his daughter’s distress, and by the embarrassed\r\n      faces of Sónya and Márya Dmítrievna, the count saw clearly that something\r\n      had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible for him to think\r\n      that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter, and he so\r\n      prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he avoided inquiries and tried\r\n      to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened; and he was only\r\n      dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the country."

    "text": "From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go\r\n      away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the Rostóvs came to\r\n      Moscow the effect Natásha had on him made him hasten to carry out his\r\n      intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph Alexéevich’s widow, who had long\r\n      since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased husband’s.\nWhen he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance\r\n      relating to Andrew Bolkónski and his betrothed. Pierre had been avoiding\r\n      Natásha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her was stronger\r\n      than a married man’s should be for his friend’s fiancée. Yet some fate\r\n      constantly threw them together.\n“What can have happened? And what can they want with me?” thought he as he\r\n      dressed to go to Márya Dmítrievna’s. “If only Prince Andrew would hurry up\r\n      and come and marry her!” thought he on his way to the house.\nOn the Tverskóy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.\n“Pierre! Been back long?” someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In a\r\n      sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the\r\n      dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makárin dashed\r\n      past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies,\r\n      the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his head\r\n      slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat, tilted\r\n      to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with\r\n      powdery snow.\n“Yes, indeed, that’s a true sage,” thought Pierre. “He sees nothing beyond\r\n      the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is always\r\n      cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn’t I give to be like him!” he\r\n      thought enviously.\nIn Márya Dmítrievna’s anteroom the footman who helped him off with his fur\r\n      coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.\nWhen he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Natásha sitting at the window,\r\n      with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at him, frowned,\r\n      and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.\n“What has happened?” asked Pierre, entering Márya Dmítrievna’s room.\n“Fine doings!” answered Dmítrievna. “For fifty-eight years have I lived in\r\n      this world and never known anything so disgraceful!”\nAnd having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him, Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna informed him that Natásha had refused Prince Andrew without her\r\n      parents’ knowledge and that the cause of this was Anatole Kurágin into\r\n      whose society Pierre’s wife had thrown her and with whom Natásha had tried\r\n      to elope during her father’s absence, in order to be married secretly.\nPierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was told\r\n      him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrew’s deeply\r\n      loved affianced wife—the same Natásha Rostóva who used to be so\r\n      charming—should give up Bolkónski for that fool Anatole who was\r\n      already secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with\r\n      him as to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not\r\n      conceive and could not imagine.\nHe could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natásha, whom he\r\n      had known from a child, with this new conception of her baseness, folly,\r\n      and cruelty. He thought of his wife. “They are all alike!” he said to\r\n      himself, reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be\r\n      tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied Prince Andrew to the point of\r\n      tears and sympathized with his wounded pride, and the more he pitied his\r\n      friend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that\r\n      Natásha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold\r\n      dignity. He did not know that Natásha’s soul was overflowing with despair,\r\n      shame, and humiliation, and that it was not her fault that her face\r\n      happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity.\n“But how get married?” said Pierre, in answer to Márya Dmítrievna. “He\r\n      could not marry—he is married!”\n“Things get worse from hour to hour!” ejaculated Márya Dmítrievna. “A nice\r\n      youth! What a scoundrel! And she’s expecting him—expecting him since\r\n      yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won’t go on expecting him.”\nAfter hearing the details of Anatole’s marriage from Pierre, and giving\r\n      vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, Márya Dmítrievna told\r\n      Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that the count or\r\n      Bolkónski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair\r\n      (which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel, and\r\n      she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave\r\n      Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre—only\r\n      now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew—promised\r\n      to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to\r\n      him, she let him go to the drawing room.\n“Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,” she\r\n      said. “And I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And stay to\r\n      dinner if you care to!” she called after Pierre.\nPierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning\r\n      Natásha had told him that she had rejected Bolkónski.\n“Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!” he said to Pierre. “What troubles\r\n      one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having come\r\n      here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken off her\r\n      engagement without consulting anybody? It’s true this engagement never was\r\n      much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but still, with his\r\n      father’s disapproval they wouldn’t have been happy, and Natásha won’t lack\r\n      suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and to take such a step\r\n      without father’s or mother’s consent! And now she’s ill, and God knows\r\n      what! It’s hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in their mother’s\r\n      absence....”\nPierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject,\r\n      but the count returned to his troubles.\nSónya entered the room with an agitated face.\n“Natásha is not quite well; she’s in her room and would like to see you.\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna is with her and she too asks you to come.”\n“Yes, you are a great friend of Bolkónski’s, no doubt she wants to send\r\n      him a message,” said the count. “Oh dear! Oh dear! How happy it all was!”\nAnd clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room.\nWhen Márya Dmítrievna told Natásha that Anatole was married, Natásha did\r\n      not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre\r\n      himself. Sónya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to\r\n      Natásha’s room.\nNatásha, pale and stern, was sitting beside Márya Dmítrievna, and her\r\n      eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the moment\r\n      he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed fixedly at him, and\r\n      her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or like the others an\r\n      enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he evidently did not exist for\r\n      her.\n“He knows all about it,” said Márya Dmítrievna pointing to Pierre and\r\n      addressing Natásha. “Let him tell you whether I have told the truth.”\nNatásha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks\r\n      at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.\n“Natálya Ilyníchna,” Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a feeling of\r\n      pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do, “whether it is true\r\n      or not should make no difference to you, because...”\n“Then it is not true that he’s married!”\n“Yes, it is true.”\n“Has he been married long?” she asked. “On your honor?...”\nPierre gave his word of honor.\n“Is he still here?” she asked, quickly.\n“Yes, I have just seen him.”\nShe was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that they\r\n      should leave her alone."

    "text": "Pierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at once.\r\n      He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kurágin, at the thought of whom\r\n      now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in breathing.\r\n      He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies’, nor at Komoneno’s.\r\n      Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as usual. The\r\n      members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in groups; they\r\n      greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news. The footman having greeted him,\r\n      knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him there was a place left\r\n      for him in the small dining room and that Prince Michael Zakhárych was in\r\n      the library, but Paul Timoféevich had not yet arrived. One of Pierre’s\r\n      acquaintances, while they were talking about the weather, asked if he had\r\n      heard of Kurágin’s abduction of Rostóva which was talked of in the town,\r\n      and was it true? Pierre laughed and said it was nonsense for he had just\r\n      come from the Rostóvs’. He asked everyone about Anatole. One man told him\r\n      he had not come yet, and another that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt\r\n      it strange to see this calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what\r\n      was going on in his soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till\r\n      everyone had come, and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for\r\n      dinner but drove home.\nAnatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with Dólokhov,\r\n      consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to\r\n      him essential to see Natásha. In the evening he drove to his sister’s to\r\n      discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after\r\n      vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole\r\n      was with the countess. The countess’ drawing room was full of guests.\nPierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return—at\r\n      that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever—entered the\r\n      drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.\n“Ah, Pierre,” said the countess going up to her husband. “You don’t know\r\n      what a plight our Anatole...”\nShe stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband’s head, in his\r\n      glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage\r\n      and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel\r\n      with Dólokhov.\n“Where you are, there is vice and evil!” said Pierre to his wife.\r\n      “Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you,” he added in French.\nAnatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow\r\n      Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was\r\n      leading him from the room.\n“If you allow yourself in my drawing room...” whispered Hélène, but Pierre\r\n      did not reply and went out of the room.\nAnatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed\r\n      anxiety.\nHaving entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole\r\n      without looking at him.\n“You promised Countess Rostóva to marry her and were about to elope with\r\n      her, is that so?”\n“Mon cher,”answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French), “I\r\n      don’t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone.”\nPierre’s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole\r\n      by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to\r\n      side till Anatole’s face showed a sufficient degree of terror.\n“When I tell you that I must talk to you!...” repeated Pierre.\n“Come now, this is stupid. What?” said Anatole, fingering a button of his\r\n      collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.\n“You’re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don’t know what deprives me\r\n      from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!” said Pierre,\r\n      expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.\nHe took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put\r\n      it back in its place.\n“Did you promise to marry her?”\n“I... I didn’t think of it. I never promised, because...”\nPierre interrupted him.\n“Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?” he said, moving toward\r\n      Anatole.\nAnatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and\r\n      drew out his pocketbook.\nPierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table that\r\n      stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.\n“I shan’t be violent, don’t be afraid!” said Pierre in answer to a\r\n      frightened gesture of Anatole’s. “First, the letters,” said he, as if\r\n      repeating a lesson to himself. “Secondly,” he continued after a short\r\n      pause, again rising and again pacing the room, “tomorrow you must get out\r\n      of Moscow.”\n“But how can I?...”\n“Thirdly,” Pierre continued without listening to him, “you must never\r\n      breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess Rostóva. I know\r\n      I can’t prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of conscience...”\r\n       Pierre paced the room several times in silence.\nAnatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.\n“After all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a\r\n      thing as other people’s happiness and peace, and that you are ruining a\r\n      whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women\r\n      like my wife—with them you are within your rights, for they know\r\n      what you want of them. They are armed against you by the same experience\r\n      of debauchery; but to promise amaidto marry her... to deceive, to\r\n      kidnap.... Don’t you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man\r\n      or a child?...”\nPierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a\r\n      questioning look.\n“I don’t know about that, eh?” said Anatole, growing more confident as\r\n      Pierre mastered his wrath. “I don’t know that and don’t want to,” he said,\r\n      not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw, “but you\r\n      have used such words to me—‘mean’ and so on—which as a man of\r\n      honor I can’t allow anyone to use.”\nPierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he wanted.\n“Though it was tête-à-tête,” Anatole continued, “still I can’t...”\n“Is it satisfaction you want?” said Pierre ironically.\n“You could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do as\r\n      you wish, eh?”\n“I take them back, I take them back!” said Pierre, “and I ask you to\r\n      forgive me.” Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. “And if you\r\n      require money for your journey...”\nAnatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile, which\r\n      Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.\n“Oh, vile and heartless brood!” he exclaimed, and left the room.\nNext day Anatole left for Petersburg."

    "text": "Pierre drove to Márya Dmítrievna’s to tell her of the fulfillment of her\r\n      wish that Kurágin should be banished from Moscow. The whole house was in a\r\n      state of alarm and commotion. Natásha was very ill, having, as Márya\r\n      Dmítrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had\r\n      been told that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily\r\n      procured. After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she\r\n      woke Sónya and told her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had\r\n      been administered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so\r\n      weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and so\r\n      the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and\r\n      Sónya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see Natásha.\nPierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about the\r\n      attempted abduction of Rostóva. He resolutely denied these rumors,\r\n      assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his brother-in-law\r\n      had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to Pierre that it was his\r\n      duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish Natásha’s reputation.\nHe was awaiting Prince Andrew’s return with dread and went every day to\r\n      the old prince’s for news of him.\nOld Prince Bolkónski heard all the rumors current in the town from\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which\r\n      Natásha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than\r\n      usual and awaited his son with great impatience.\nSome days after Anatole’s departure Pierre received a note from Prince\r\n      Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.\nAs soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his father\r\n      Natásha’s note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement (Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given it to the old\r\n      prince), and he heard from him the story of Natásha’s elopement, with\r\n      additions.\nPrince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next\r\n      morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state as\r\n      Natásha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear\r\n      him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue\r\n      going on in Petersburg. The old prince’s voice and another now and then\r\n      interrupted him. Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She sighed,\r\n      looking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was, evidently\r\n      intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre saw by her\r\n      face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her\r\n      brother had taken the news of Natásha’s faithlessness.\n“He says he expected it,” she remarked. “I know his pride will not let him\r\n      express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far better, than I\r\n      expected. Evidently it had to be....”\n“But is it possible that all is really ended?” asked Pierre.\nPrincess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand how\r\n      he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince Andrew,\r\n      greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh horizontal\r\n      wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing his father and\r\n      Prince Meshchérski, warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating. The\r\n      conversation was about Speránski—the news of whose sudden exile and\r\n      alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.\n“Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a\r\n      month ago,” Prince Andrew was saying, “and by those who were unable to\r\n      understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him\r\n      all the blame of other men’s mistakes is very easy, but I maintain that if\r\n      anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him, by\r\n      him alone.”\nHe paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately\r\n      assumed a vindictive expression.\n“Posterity will do him justice,” he concluded, and at once turned to\r\n      Pierre.\n“Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?” he said with animation, but\r\n      the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. “Yes, I am well,” he said in\r\n      answer to Pierre’s question, and smiled.\nTo Pierre that smile said plainly: “I am well, but my health is now of no\r\n      use to anyone.”\nAfter a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish\r\n      frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and\r\n      about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his son’s tutor,\r\n      Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about Speránski\r\n      which was still going on between the two old men.\n“If there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon, they\r\n      would have been made public,” he said with warmth and haste. “I do not,\r\n      and never did, like Speránski personally, but I like justice!”\nPierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too\r\n      familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in\r\n      order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate. When\r\n      Prince Meshchérski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierre’s arm and asked him\r\n      into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made up there,\r\n      and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince Andrew went to\r\n      one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a packet wrapped in\r\n      paper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He stood up and coughed.\r\n      His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.\n“Forgive me for troubling you....”\nPierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natásha, and his broad\r\n      face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince Andrew,\r\n      and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued:\n“I have received a refusal from Countess Rostóva and have heard reports of\r\n      your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind. Is\r\n      that true?”\n“Both true and untrue,” Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.\n“Here are her letters and her portrait,” said he.\nHe took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.\n“Give this to the countess... if you see her.”\n“She is very ill,” said Pierre.\n“Then she is here still?” said Prince Andrew. “And Prince Kurágin?” he\r\n      added quickly.\n“He left long ago. She has been at death’s door.”\n“I much regret her illness,” said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his\r\n      father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.\n“So Monsieur Kurágin has not honored Countess Rostóva with his hand?” said\r\n      Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.\n“He could not marry, for he was married already,” said Pierre.\nPrince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.\n“And where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?” he said.\n“He has gone to Peters... But I don’t know,” said Pierre.\n“Well, it doesn’t matter,” said Prince Andrew. “Tell Countess Rostóva that\r\n      she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is good.”\nPierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether he\r\n      had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say anything,\r\n      looked fixedly at him.\n“I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?” asked Pierre,\r\n      “about...”\n“Yes,” returned Prince Andrew hastily. “I said that a fallen woman should\r\n      be forgiven, but I didn’t say I could forgive her. I can’t.”\n“But can this be compared...?” said Pierre.\nPrince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: “Yes, ask her hand again,\r\n      be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but I am\r\n      unable to follow in that gentleman’s footsteps. If you wish to be my\r\n      friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So you’ll\r\n      give her the packet?”\nPierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.\nThe old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as\r\n      always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her\r\n      satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them\r\n      Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the Rostóvs,\r\n      and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of\r\n      her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.\nAt dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming\r\n      evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with his father,\r\n      now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an unnatural animation,\r\n      the cause of which Pierre so well understood."

    "text": "That same evening Pierre went to the Rostóvs’ to fulfill the commission\r\n      entrusted to him. Natásha was in bed, the count at the club, and Pierre,\r\n      after giving the letters to Sónya, went to Márya Dmítrievna who was\r\n      interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes later\r\n      Sónya came to Márya Dmítrievna.\n“Natásha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirílovich,” said she.\n“But how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been tidied\r\n      up.”\n“No, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,” said Sónya.\nMárya Dmítrievna only shrugged her shoulders.\n“When will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind, don’t\r\n      tell her everything!” said she to Pierre. “One hasn’t the heart to scold\r\n      her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied.”\nNatásha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with a\r\n      pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find her.\r\n      When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided\r\n      whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.\nPierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as usual;\r\n      but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her arms hanging\r\n      lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the\r\n      middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different expression of\r\n      face.\n“Peter Kirílovich,” she began rapidly, “Prince Bolkónski was your friend—is\r\n      your friend,” she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that everything\r\n      that had once been must now be different.) “He told me once to apply to\r\n      you...”\nPierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then he had\r\n      reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he now felt so\r\n      sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.\n“He is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!” She stopped and\r\n      breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.\n“Yes... I will tell him,” answered Pierre; “but...”\nHe did not know what to say.\nNatásha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she\r\n      had meant.\n“No, I know all is over,” she said hurriedly. “No, that can never be. I’m\r\n      only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only that I beg him\r\n      to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....”\nShe trembled all over and sat down on a chair.\nA sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre’s heart.\n“I will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,” said Pierre.\r\n      “But... I should like to know one thing....”\n“Know what?” Natásha’s eyes asked.\n“I should like to know, did you love...” Pierre did not know how to refer\r\n      to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him—“did you love that bad\r\n      man?”\n“Don’t call him bad!” said Natásha. “But I don’t know, don’t know at\r\n      all....”\nShe began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love\r\n      welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and\r\n      hoped they would not be noticed.\n“We won’t speak of it any more, my dear,” said Pierre, and his gentle,\r\n      cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Natásha.\n“We won’t speak of it, my dear—I’ll tell him everything; but one\r\n      thing I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help, advice,\r\n      or simply to open your heart to someone—not now, but when your mind\r\n      is clearer—think of me!” He took her hand and kissed it. “I shall be happy\r\n      if it’s in my power...”\nPierre grew confused.\n“Don’t speak to me like that. I am not worth it!” exclaimed Natásha and\r\n      turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.\nHe knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it he was\r\n      amazed at his own words.\n“Stop, stop! You have your whole life before you,” said he to her.\n“Before me? No! All is over for me,” she replied with shame and\r\n      self-abasement.\n“All over?” he repeated. “If I were not myself, but the\r\n      handsomest, cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this\r\n      moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love!”\nFor the first time for many days Natásha wept tears of gratitude and\r\n      tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.\nPierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom, restraining\r\n      tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without finding the\r\n      sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh.\n“Where to now, your excellency?” asked the coachman.\n“Where to?” Pierre asked himself. “Where can I go now? Surely\r\n      not to the Club or to pay calls?” All men seemed so pitiful, so poor,\r\n      in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in\r\n      comparison with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him through\r\n      her tears.\n“Home!” said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost Fahrenheit he\r\n      threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the air\r\n      with joy.\nIt was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the black\r\n      roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky did\r\n      Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things\r\n      compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised. At the\r\n      entrance to the Arbát Square an immense expanse of dark starry sky\r\n      presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the\r\n      Prechístenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but\r\n      distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white light,\r\n      and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant comet of 1812—the\r\n      comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the\r\n      world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long luminous tail aroused\r\n      no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with\r\n      tears, at this bright comet which, having traveled in its orbit with\r\n      inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly—like\r\n      an arrow piercing the earth—to remain fixed in a chosen spot,\r\n      vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and displaying its white light\r\n      amid countless other scintillating stars. It seemed to Pierre that this\r\n      comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted\r\n      soul, now blossoming into a new life."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER I",
    "text": "From the close of the year 1811 an intensified arming and concentrating of\r\n      the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forces—millions\r\n      of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the army—moved from\r\n      the west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which since 1811\r\n      Russian forces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812, the\r\n      forces of Western Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war began, that\r\n      is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature.\r\n      Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes,\r\n      frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money, burglaries,\r\n      incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the\r\n      annals of all the law courts of the world, but which those who committed\r\n      them did not at the time regard as being crimes.\nWhat produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The\r\n      historians tell us with naïve assurance that its causes were the wrongs\r\n      inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental\r\n      System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the mistakes\r\n      of the diplomatists, and so on.\nConsequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,\r\n      Rumyántsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have\r\n      taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to have\r\n      written to Alexander: “My respected Brother, I consent to restore the\r\n      duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg”—and there would have been no war.\nWe can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries. It\r\n      naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England’s\r\n      intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally\r\n      seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war was\r\n      Napoleon’s ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the war\r\n      was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the war was\r\n      the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals and old\r\n      soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving\r\n      them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of\r\n      re-establishingles bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that time\r\n      that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between Russia and\r\n      Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed from Napoleon,\r\n      and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It is natural that\r\n      these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons, the number\r\n      depending on the endless diversity of points of view, presented themselves\r\n      to the men of that day; but to us, to posterity who view the thing that\r\n      happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning,\r\n      these causes seem insufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions\r\n      of Christian men killed and tortured each other either because Napoleon\r\n      was ambitious or Alexander was firm, or because England’s policy was\r\n      astute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection\r\n      such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence:\r\n      why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of\r\n      Europe killed and ruined the people of Smolénsk and Moscow and were killed\r\n      by them.\nTo us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away\r\n      by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with\r\n      unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present\r\n      themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them\r\n      we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us\r\n      equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared\r\n      to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence—apart from the\r\n      cooperation of all the other coincident causes—to occasion the\r\n      event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to\r\n      serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon’s refusal to\r\n      withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of\r\n      Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and\r\n      a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so\r\n      many less men in Napoleon’s army and the war could not have occurred.\nHad Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw\r\n      beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would\r\n      have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second\r\n      term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been a\r\n      war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had\r\n      Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic\r\n      government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent\r\n      dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French\r\n      Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have\r\n      happened. So all these causes—myriads of causes—coincided to\r\n      bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it\r\n      had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human\r\n      feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows,\r\n      just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to\r\n      the west, slaying their fellows.\nThe actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to\r\n      hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn\r\n      into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be otherwise,\r\n      for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom the event\r\n      seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of innumerable\r\n      circumstances was needed without any one of which the event could not have\r\n      taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the\r\n      real power—the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and\r\n      guns—should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals,\r\n      and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and\r\n      complex causes.\nWe are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational\r\n      events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of which we do not\r\n      understand). The more we try to explain such events in history reasonably,\r\n      the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us.\nEach man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal aims,\r\n      and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from doing\r\n      this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action performed\r\n      at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history, in\r\n      which it has not a free but a predestined significance.\nThere are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which\r\n      is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive\r\n      life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.\nMan lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in the\r\n      attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done is\r\n      irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of\r\n      millions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man\r\n      stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with and the\r\n      more power he has over others, the more evident is the predestination and\r\n      inevitability of his every action.\n“The king’s heart is in the hands of the Lord.”\nA king is history’s slave.\nHistory, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, uses\r\n      every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.\nThough Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever that\r\n      it depended on him,verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses peuples*—as\r\n      Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him—he had never\r\n      been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which compelled him, while\r\n      thinking that he was acting on his own volition, to perform for the hive\r\n      life—that is to say, for history—whatever had to be performed.\n* “To shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples.”\nThe people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and by\r\n      the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and\r\n      co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the\r\n      nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg’s wrongs,\r\n      the movement of troops into Prussia—undertaken (as it seemed to\r\n      Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the French\r\n      Emperor’s love and habit of war coinciding with his people’s inclinations,\r\n      allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the expenditure on\r\n      those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages to compensate for\r\n      that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received in Dresden, the\r\n      diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of contemporaries, were\r\n      carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace, but which only wounded\r\n      the self-love of both sides, and millions of other causes that adapted\r\n      themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with it.\nWhen an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its\r\n      attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried by\r\n      the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or because\r\n      the boy standing below wants to eat it?\nNothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in\r\n      which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist who\r\n      finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth\r\n      is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the\r\n      apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it. Equally right or\r\n      wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he wanted to,\r\n      and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and he who says\r\n      that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last\r\n      navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock. In historic events the\r\n      so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and like labels\r\n      they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.\nEvery act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is in\r\n      an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of\r\n      history and predestined from eternity."

    "text": "On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent three\r\n      weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings, and even\r\n      an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the emperor, kings,\r\n      and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings and princes with\r\n      whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds of his own—that\r\n      is, which he had taken from other kings—to the Empress of Austria,\r\n      and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the Empress Marie\r\n      Louise—who regarded him as her husband, though he had left another\r\n      wife in Paris—left her grieved by the parting which she seemed\r\n      hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the\r\n      possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though the\r\n      Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, calling himMonsieur\r\n      mon frère, and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would\r\n      always love and honor him—yet he set off to join his army, and at\r\n      every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops\r\n      from west to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses,\r\n      surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to\r\n      Posen, Thorn, Danzig, and Königsberg. At each of these towns thousands of\r\n      people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.\nThe army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried\r\n      him in the same direction. On the tenth of June, * coming up with the\r\n      army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of a\r\n      Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.\n* Old style.\nNext day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the Niemen, and,\r\n      changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to\r\n      select a place for the crossing.\nSeeing, on the other side, some Cossacks(les Cosaques)and the\r\n      wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow(Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia into\r\n      which Alexander the Great had marched—Napoleon unexpectedly, and\r\n      contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an\r\n      advance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.\nEarly in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent, which\r\n      was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and looked\r\n      through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the\r\n      Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the\r\n      river. The troops, knowing of the Emperor’s presence, were on the lookout\r\n      for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a\r\n      cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill,\r\n      they threw up their caps and shouted:“Vive l’Empereur!”and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had\r\n      concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three bridges to\r\n      the other side.\n“Now we’ll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things\r\n      get hot... by heaven!... There he is!...Vive l’Empereur!So these are\r\n      the steppes of Asia! It’s a nasty country all the same.Au revoir, Beauché;\r\n      I’ll keep the best palace in Moscow for you!Au revoir. Good luck!... Did\r\n      you see the Emperor?Vive l’Empereur!... preur!—If they make me\r\n      Governor of India, Gérard, I’ll make you Minister of Kashmir—that’s\r\n      settled.Vive l’Empereur!Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The Cossacks—those\r\n      rascals—see how they run!Vive l’Empereur!There he is, do you see\r\n      him? I’ve seen him twice, as I see you now. The little corporal... I saw\r\n      him give the cross to one of the veterans....Vive l’Empereur!” came the\r\n      voices of men, old and young, of most diverse characters and social\r\n      positions. On the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the\r\n      commencement of the long-expected campaign and of rapture and devotion to\r\n      the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill.\nOn the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was\r\n      brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the\r\n      bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous\r\n      acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to\r\n      forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting, but the\r\n      shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him\r\n      from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the\r\n      army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther\r\n      side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in the direction of Kóvno,\r\n      preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the Guard who, breathless\r\n      with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops.\r\n      On reaching the broad river Víliya, he stopped near a regiment of Polish\r\n      Uhlans stationed by the river.\n“Vivat!”shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and\r\n      pressing against one another to see him.\nNapoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log\r\n      that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed him\r\n      which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him, and he\r\n      gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became absorbed in a map laid out on\r\n      the logs. Without lifting his head he said something, and two of his\r\n      aides-de-camp galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.\n“What? What did he say?” was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans when\r\n      one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.\nThe order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the\r\n      Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech\r\n      from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted to\r\n      swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. In evident fear\r\n      of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he begged\r\n      to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor’s eyes. The\r\n      aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be displeased at\r\n      this excess of zeal.\nAs soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer, with\r\n      happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted“Vivat!”and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped into\r\n      the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown restive\r\n      under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest part where\r\n      the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after him. It was\r\n      cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream, and the\r\n      Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses. Some of\r\n      the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others tried to swim on,\r\n      some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses’ manes. They tried to\r\n      make their way forward to the opposite bank and, though there was a ford\r\n      one third of a mile away, were proud that they were swimming and drowning\r\n      in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not\r\n      even looking at what they were doing. When the aide-de-camp, having\r\n      returned and choosing an opportune moment, ventured to draw the Emperor’s\r\n      attention to the devotion of the Poles to his person, the little man in\r\n      the gray overcoat got up and, having summoned Berthier, began pacing up\r\n      and down the bank with him, giving him instructions and occasionally\r\n      glancing disapprovingly at the drowning Uhlans who distracted his\r\n      attention.\nFor him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the\r\n      world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to dumfound\r\n      people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called for his horse and\r\n      rode to his quarters.\nSome forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to\r\n      their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which they\r\n      had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and with\r\n      difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they had got\r\n      out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted“Vivat!”and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he no\r\n      longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.\nThat evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper\r\n      money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as\r\n      possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter\r\n      containing information about the orders to the French army had been found,\r\n      Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who had needlessly\r\n      plunged into the river should be enrolled in theLégion d’honneurof which\r\n      Napoleon was himself the head.\nQuos vult perdere dementat.*\n* Those whom (God) wishes to destroy he drives mad."

    "text": "The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in Vílna for more than a month,\r\n      reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for the war that\r\n      everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come from\r\n      Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation between\r\n      the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the Emperor\r\n      had been at headquarters for a month. Each of the three armies had its own\r\n      commander in chief, but there was no supreme commander of all the forces,\r\n      and the Emperor did not assume that responsibility himself.\nThe longer the Emperor remained in Vílna the less did everybody—tired\r\n      of waiting—prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who\r\n      surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his\r\n      time pleasantly and forget that war was impending.\nIn June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the\r\n      courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish\r\n      aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the\r\n      Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received. The Emperor\r\n      gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by subscription. The\r\n      lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the Emperor was invited to act\r\n      as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a landowner in the Vílna province,\r\n      offered his country house for the fete, and the thirteenth of June was\r\n      fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and fireworks at Zakret, Count\r\n      Bennigsen’s country seat.\nThe very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and his\r\n      vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian frontier,\r\n      Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his\r\n      aides-de-camp at Bennigsen’s country house.\nIt was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters declared\r\n      that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place.\r\n      Countess Bezúkhova was present among other Russian ladies who had followed\r\n      the sovereign from Petersburg to Vílna and eclipsed the refined Polish\r\n      ladies by her massive, so-called Russian type of beauty. The Emperor\r\n      noticed her and honored her with a dance.\nBorís Drubetskóy, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the presenten garçon(as he phrased it), was also there and, though not an\r\n      aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. Borís was\r\n      now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage\r\n      but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age. He\r\n      was meeting Hélène in Vílna after not having seen her for a long time and\r\n      did not recall the past, but as Hélène was enjoying the favors of a very\r\n      important personage and Borís had only recently married, they met as good\r\n      friends of long standing.\nAt midnight dancing was still going on. Hélène, not having a suitable\r\n      partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Borís. They were the\r\n      third couple. Borís, coolly looking at Hélène’s dazzling bare shoulders\r\n      which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her of\r\n      old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and\r\n      unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor\r\n      who was in the same room. The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the\r\n      doorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which\r\n      he alone knew how to utter.\nAs the mazurka began, Borís saw that Adjutant General Balashëv, one of\r\n      those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him and contrary to\r\n      court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a Polish lady.\r\n      Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly at\r\n      Balashëv and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because\r\n      there were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady and\r\n      turned to him. Hardly had Balashëv begun to speak before a look of\r\n      amazement appeared on the Emperor’s face. He took Balashëv by the arm and\r\n      crossed the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide\r\n      as the people on both sides made way for him. Borís noticed Arakchéev’s\r\n      excited face when the sovereign went out with Balashëv. Arakchéev looked\r\n      at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his red nose,\r\n      stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him.\r\n      (Borís understood that Arakchéev envied Balashëv and was displeased that\r\n      evidently important news had reached the Emperor otherwise than through\r\n      himself.)\nBut the Emperor and Balashëv passed out into the illuminated garden\r\n      without noticing Arakchéev who, holding his sword and glancing wrathfully\r\n      around, followed some twenty paces behind them.\nAll the time Borís was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was\r\n      worried by the question of what news Balashëv had brought and how he could\r\n      find it out before others. In the figure in which he had to choose two\r\n      ladies, he whispered to Hélène that he meant to choose Countess Potocka\r\n      who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over the\r\n      parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing Balashëv and\r\n      the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were moving\r\n      toward the door. Borís, fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw,\r\n      respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.\nThe Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted,\r\n      was finishing with these words:\n“To enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as long as a\r\n      single armed enemy remains in my country!” It seemed to Borís that it gave\r\n      the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was satisfied with the form\r\n      in which he had expressed his thoughts, but displeased that Borís had\r\n      overheard it.\n“Let no one know of it!” the Emperor added with a frown.\nBorís understood that this was meant for him and, closing his eyes,\r\n      slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and remained\r\n      there about another half-hour.\nBorís was thus the first to learn the news that the French army had\r\n      crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain important\r\n      personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to\r\n      him, and by this means he rose higher in their estimation.\n\nThe unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was\r\n      particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, and at a\r\n      ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation and\r\n      resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully\r\n      expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On returning home at\r\n      two o’clock that night he sent for his secretary, Shishkóv, and told him\r\n      to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal Prince\r\n      Saltykóv, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would\r\n      not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on Russian\r\n      soil.\nNext day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:\nMonsieur mon frère,\nYesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept my\r\n      engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian\r\n      frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in which\r\n      Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that Your\r\n      Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the\r\n      time Prince Kurákin asked for his passports. The reasons on which the Duc\r\n      de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led\r\n      me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression. In fact,\r\n      the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was never authorized to make\r\n      that demand, and as soon as I was informed of it I let him know how much I\r\n      disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post. If Your Majesty\r\n      does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a\r\n      misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your troops from Russian\r\n      territory, I will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an\r\n      understanding between us will be possible. In the contrary case, Your\r\n      Majesty, I shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my\r\n      part has provoked. It still depends on Your Majesty to preserve humanity\r\n      from the calamity of another war.\nI am, etc.,\n(signed) Alexander"

    "text": "At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having sent\r\n      for Balashëv and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him to take it\r\n      and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When dispatching Balashëv,\r\n      the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long\r\n      as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told him to transmit\r\n      those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them in his letter to\r\n      Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be\r\n      injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation\r\n      was being made, but he definitely instructed Balashëv to repeat them\r\n      personally to Napoleon.\nHaving set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a\r\n      bugler and two Cossacks, Balashëv reached the French outposts at the\r\n      village of Rykónty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn. There he\r\n      was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.\nA French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a\r\n      shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashëv to halt. Balashëv did not\r\n      do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace.\nThe noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,\r\n      advanced his horse’s chest against Balashëv, put his hand to his saber,\r\n      and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that he did\r\n      not do as he was told? Balashëv mentioned who he was. The noncommissioned\r\n      officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without\r\n      looking at the Russian general.\nAfter living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after\r\n      conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in general\r\n      being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service, Balashëv\r\n      found it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile, and\r\n      still more this disrespectful, application of brute force to himself.\nThe sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air was fresh\r\n      and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the\r\n      village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one after another,\r\n      like bubbles rising in water.\nBalashëv looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the\r\n      village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked\r\n      silently at one another from time to time.\nA French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came\r\n      riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied by two\r\n      hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked smart and\r\n      well kept.\nIt was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim,\r\n      almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of martial\r\n      swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of\r\n      enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.\nThe French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was polite and\r\n      evidently understood Balashëv’s importance. He led him past his soldiers\r\n      and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the\r\n      Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperor’s\r\n      quarters were, he believed, not far off.\nThey rode through the village of Rykónty, past tethered French hussar\r\n      horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with\r\n      curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the\r\n      village. The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile\r\n      and a quarter away and would receive Balashëv and conduct him to his\r\n      destination.\nThe sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.\nThey had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a group\r\n      of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a black horse\r\n      with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes in\r\n      his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders. He wore a red\r\n      mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion. This man\r\n      rode toward Balashëv at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and gold\r\n      lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.\nBalashëv was only two horses’ length from the equestrian with the\r\n      bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping\r\n      toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the French\r\n      colonel, whispered respectfully: “The King of Naples!” It was, in fact,\r\n      Murat, now called “King of Naples.” Though it was quite incomprehensible\r\n      why he should be King of Naples, he was called so, and was himself\r\n      convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more solemn and\r\n      important air than formerly. He was so sure that he really was the King of\r\n      Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that city, while\r\n      walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians called out to\r\n      him:“Viva il re!”* he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said:\r\n      “Poor fellows, they don’t know that I am leaving them tomorrow!”\n* “Long live the king.”\nBut though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied the\r\n      grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he had been\r\n      ordered to return to military service—and especially since his last\r\n      interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august brother-in-law had told\r\n      him: “I made you King that you should reign in my way, but not in yours!”—he\r\n      had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, and—like a well-fed\r\n      but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish\r\n      between the shafts—he dressed up in clothes as variegated and\r\n      expensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads\r\n      of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.\nOn seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair\r\n      curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked\r\n      inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully informed His\r\n      Majesty of Balashëv’s mission, whose name he could not pronounce.\n“De Bal-machève!” said the King (overcoming by his assurance the\r\n      difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). “Charmed to make\r\n      your acquaintance, General!” he added, with a gesture of kingly\r\n      condescension.\nAs soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity\r\n      instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his natural\r\n      tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the withers of\r\n      Balashëv’s horse and said:\n“Well, General, it all looks like war,” as if regretting a circumstance of\r\n      which he was unable to judge.\n“Your Majesty,” replied Balashëv, “my master, the Emperor, does not desire\r\n      war and as Your Majesty sees...” said Balashëv, using the wordsYour\r\n      Majestyat every opportunity, with the affectation unavoidable in\r\n      frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty.\nMurat’s face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to “Monsieur\r\n      de Bal-machève.” Butroyauté oblige!* and he felt it incumbent on him, as\r\n      a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexander’s envoy. He\r\n      dismounted, took Balashëv’s arm, and moving a few steps away from his\r\n      suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down with him,\r\n      trying to speak significantly. He referred to the fact that the Emperor\r\n      Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from\r\n      Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known and the\r\n      dignity of France was thereby offended.\n* “Royalty has its obligations.”\nBalashëv replied that there was “nothing offensive in the demand,\r\n      because...” but Murat interrupted him.\n“Then you don’t consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?” he asked\r\n      unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.\nBalashëv told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of the\r\n      war.\n“Oh, my dear general!” Murat again interrupted him, “with all my heart I\r\n      wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war\r\n      begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!” said he, in\r\n      the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another\r\n      despite a quarrel between their masters.\nAnd he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his\r\n      health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent\r\n      with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity,\r\n      Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood at\r\n      his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:\n“I won’t detain you longer, General. I wish success to your mission,” and\r\n      with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his glittering\r\n      ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him.\nBalashëv rode on, supposing from Murat’s words that he would very soon be\r\n      brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the next village\r\n      the sentinels of Davout’s infantry corps detained him as the pickets of\r\n      the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps commander, who was\r\n      fetched, conducted him into the village to Marshal Davout."

    "text": "Davout was to Napoleon what Arakchéev was to Alexander—though not a\r\n      coward like Arakchéev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to\r\n      express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.\nIn the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are necessary\r\n      in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always appear and hold\r\n      their own, however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the\r\n      head of the government may be. This inevitability alone can explain how\r\n      the cruel Arakchéev, who tore out a grenadier’s mustache with his own\r\n      hands, whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger, and who was\r\n      neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to maintain his powerful\r\n      position with Alexander, whose own character was chivalrous, noble, and\r\n      gentle.\nBalashëv found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasant’s hut,\r\n      writing—he was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been\r\n      found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put\r\n      themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being\r\n      gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry.\r\n      “How can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I am sitting\r\n      on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?” the expression of his face\r\n      seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men, when they\r\n      encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own dreary,\r\n      persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashëv\r\n      was brought in. He became still more absorbed in his task when the Russian\r\n      general entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at Balashëv’s\r\n      face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with\r\n      Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still more and sneered\r\n      malevolently.\nWhen he noticed in Balashëv’s face the disagreeable impression this\r\n      reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he\r\n      wanted.\nThinking he could have been received in such a manner only because Davout\r\n      did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor Alexander and\r\n      even his envoy to Napoleon, Balashëv hastened to inform him of his rank\r\n      and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, after hearing him,\r\n      became still surlier and ruder.\n“Where is your dispatch?” he inquired. “Give it to me. I will send it to\r\n      the Emperor.”\nBalashëv replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the\r\n      Emperor.\n“Your Emperor’s orders are obeyed in your army, but here,” said Davout,\r\n      “you must do as you’re told.”\nAnd, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his\r\n      dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on\r\n      duty.\nBalashëv took out the packet containing the Emperor’s letter and laid it\r\n      on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid\r\n      across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.\n“You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,” protested\r\n      Balashëv, “but permit me to observe that I have the honor to be adjutant\r\n      general to His Majesty....”\nDavout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs\r\n      of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashëv’s face.\n“You will be treated as is fitting,” said he and, putting the packet in\r\n      his pocket, left the shed.\nA minute later the marshal’s adjutant, de Castrès, came in and conducted\r\n      Balashëv to the quarters assigned him.\nThat day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the barrels.\nNext day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashëv to come to him,\r\n      peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the baggage\r\n      train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one except\r\n      Monsieur de Castrès.\nAfter four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his impotence and\r\n      insignificance—particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of\r\n      power in which he had so lately moved—and after several marches with\r\n      the marshal’s baggage and the French army, which occupied the whole\r\n      district, Balashëv was brought to Vílna—now occupied by the French—through\r\n      the very gate by which he had left it four days previously.\nNext day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came to\r\n      Balashëv and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon’s wish to honor him with\r\n      an audience.\nFour days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhénsk regiment had stood in\r\n      front of the house to which Balashëv was conducted, and now two French\r\n      grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with\r\n      shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a\r\n      brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting\r\n      for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle\r\n      horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balashëv in the very\r\n      house in Vílna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission."

    "text": "Though Balashëv was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury and\r\n      magnificence of Napoleon’s court.\nThe Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many\r\n      generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates—several of whom\r\n      Balashëv had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia—were\r\n      waiting. Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before\r\n      going for his ride.\nAfter some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into the\r\n      great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balashëv to follow him.\nBalashëv went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a\r\n      study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him on\r\n      his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried footsteps\r\n      beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all was silent and\r\n      then from the study the sound was heard of other steps, firm and resolute—they\r\n      were those of Napoleon. He had just finished dressing for his ride, and\r\n      wore a blue uniform, opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that\r\n      it covered his rotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly fitting the\r\n      fat thighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots. His short hair had\r\n      evidently just been brushed, but one lock hung down in the middle of his\r\n      broad forehead. His plump white neck stood out sharply above the black\r\n      collar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau de Cologne. His full face,\r\n      rather young-looking, with its prominent chin, wore a gracious and\r\n      majestic expression of imperial welcome.\nHe entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown\r\n      back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders, and\r\n      chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that imposing and stately\r\n      appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort. It was evident,\r\n      too, that he was in the best of spirits that day.\nHe nodded in answer to Balashëv’s low and respectful bow, and coming up to\r\n      him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time\r\n      and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will\r\n      always say the right thing and say it well.\n“Good day, General!” said he. “I have received the letter you brought from\r\n      the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.” He glanced with his\r\n      large eyes into Balashëv’s face and immediately looked past him.\nIt was plain that Balashëv’s personality did not interest him at all.\r\n      Evidently only what took place withinhis ownmind interested him. Nothing\r\n      outside himself had any significance for him, because everything in the\r\n      world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his will.\n“I do not, and did not, desire war,” he continued, “but it has\r\n      been forced on me. Evennow” (he emphasized the word) “I am\r\n      ready to receive any explanations you can give me.”\nAnd he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for\r\n      dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly\r\n      moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashëv was\r\n      firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into\r\n      negotiations.\nWhen Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the Russian\r\n      envoy, Balashëv began a speech he had prepared long before: “Sire! The\r\n      Emperor, my master...” but the sight of the Emperor’s eyes bent on him\r\n      confused him. “You are flurried—compose yourself!” Napoleon seemed\r\n      to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at Balashëv’s\r\n      uniform and sword.\nBalashëv recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the Emperor\r\n      Alexander did not consider Kurákin’s demand for his passports a sufficient\r\n      cause for war; that Kurákin had acted on his own initiative and without\r\n      his sovereign’s assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not desire war, and\r\n      had no relations with England.\n“Notyet!” interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his\r\n      feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashëv might\r\n      proceed.\nAfter saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashëv added that the\r\n      Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into negotiations\r\n      except on condition that... Here Balashëv hesitated: he remembered the\r\n      words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his letter, but had\r\n      specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykóv and had told Balashëv to\r\n      repeat to Napoleon. Balashëv remembered these words, “So long as a single\r\n      armed foe remains on Russian soil,” but some complex feeling restrained\r\n      him. He could not utter them, though he wished to do so. He grew confused\r\n      and said: “On condition that the French army retires beyond the Niemen.”\nNapoleon noticed Balashëv’s embarrassment when uttering these last words;\r\n      his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver\r\n      rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a\r\n      louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that\r\n      followed, Balashëv, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily\r\n      noticed the quivering of Napoleon’s left leg which increased the more\r\n      Napoleon raised his voice.\n“I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,” he began. “Have I\r\n      not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I have waited\r\n      eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin negotiations, what\r\n      is demanded of me?” he said, frowning and making an energetic gesture of\r\n      inquiry with his small white plump hand.\n“The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,” replied Balashëv.\n“The Niemen?” repeated Napoleon. “So now you want me to retire beyond the\r\n      Niemen—only the Niemen?” repeated Napoleon, looking straight at\r\n      Balashëv.\nThe latter bowed his head respectfully.\nInstead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania,\r\n      only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned\r\n      quickly and began to pace the room.\n“You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen before\r\n      commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago the\r\n      demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder, and yet\r\n      you are willing to negotiate.”\nHe went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again\r\n      stopped in front of Balashëv. Balashëv noticed that his left leg was\r\n      quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern\r\n      expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was\r\n      conscious of. “The vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,” he\r\n      remarked at a later date.\n“Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a\r\n      Prince of Baden, but not to me!” Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his\r\n      own surprise. “If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept\r\n      such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his\r\n      army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I\r\n      have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when\r\n      your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the aim\r\n      of your alliance with England? What has she given you?” he continued\r\n      hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and\r\n      discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and\r\n      Alexander’s errors and duplicity.\nThe commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention\r\n      of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was\r\n      nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking, and the more\r\n      he talked the less could he control his words.\nThe whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and\r\n      insult Alexander—just what he had least desired at the commencement\r\n      of the interview.\n“I hear you have made peace with Turkey?”\nBalashëv bowed his head affirmatively.\n“Peace has been concluded...” he began.\nBut Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the\r\n      talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and\r\n      unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.\n“Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining Moldavia\r\n      and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those provinces as I gave\r\n      him Finland. Yes,” he went on, “I promised and would have given the\r\n      Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he won’t have those\r\n      splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to his empire and in a\r\n      single reign would have extended Russia from the Gulf of Bothnia to the\r\n      mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could not have done more,” said\r\n      Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room,\r\n      repeating to Balashëv almost the very words he had used to Alexander\r\n      himself at Tilsit. “All that, he would have owed to my friendship. Oh,\r\n      what a splendid reign!” he repeated several times, then paused, drew from\r\n      his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at\r\n      it.\n“What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander’smight have been!”\nHe looked compassionately at Balashëv, and as soon as the latter tried to\r\n      make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.\n“What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my\r\n      friendship?” demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders in perplexity.\r\n      “But no, he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies, and with\r\n      whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and Wintzingerodes! Stein, a\r\n      traitor expelled from his own country; Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer;\r\n      Wintzingerode, a fugitive French subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a\r\n      soldier than the others, but all the same an incompetent who was unable to\r\n      do anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor\r\n      Alexander’s mind.... Granted that were they competent they might be made\r\n      use of,” continued Napoleon—hardly able to keep pace in words with\r\n      the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and\r\n      strong he was (in his perception the two were one and the same)—“but\r\n      they are not even that! They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is\r\n      said to be the most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by\r\n      his first movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel\r\n      proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on\r\n      to act, does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no\r\n      result. Bagratión alone is a military man. He’s stupid, but he has\r\n      experience, a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your young\r\n      monarch playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on\r\n      him the responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign should not be\r\n      with the army unless he is a general!” said Napoleon, evidently uttering\r\n      these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander\r\n      desired to be a military commander.\n“The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven’t even been able to\r\n      defend Vílna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish\r\n      provinces. Your army is grumbling.”\n“On the contrary, Your Majesty,” said Balashëv, hardly able to remember\r\n      what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with\r\n      difficulty, “the troops are burning with eagerness...”\n“I know everything!” Napoleon interrupted him. “I know everything. I know\r\n      the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have not\r\n      two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give you\r\n      my word of honor,” said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor could\r\n      carry no weight—“I give you my word of honor that I have five\r\n      hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will\r\n      be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making\r\n      peace with you. As for the Swedes—it is their fate to be governed by\r\n      mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for another—Bernadotte,\r\n      who promptly went mad—for no Swede would ally himself with Russia\r\n      unless he were mad.”\nNapoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.\nBalashëv knew how to reply to each of Napoleon’s remarks, and would have\r\n      done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say\r\n      something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity of\r\n      the Swedes, Balashëv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side\r\n      Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to\r\n      drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man\r\n      has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the\r\n      right. Balashëv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean\r\n      his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank\r\n      before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized\r\n      Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any\r\n      significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he\r\n      came to his senses. Balashëv stood with downcast eyes, looking at the\r\n      movements of Napoleon’s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes.\n“But what do I care about your allies?” said Napoleon. “I have allies—the\r\n      Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions. And\r\n      there will be two hundred thousand of them.”\nAnd probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this\r\n      obvious falsehood, and that Balashëv still stood silently before him in\r\n      the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned round,\r\n      drew close to Balashëv’s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and\r\n      energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:\n“Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I’ll wipe it off the map of\r\n      Europe!” he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he struck\r\n      one of his small hands energetically with the other. “Yes, I will throw\r\n      you back beyond the Dvína and beyond the Dnieper, and will re-erect\r\n      against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of Europe to\r\n      allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you. That is what\r\n      you have gained by alienating me!” And he walked silently several times up\r\n      and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.\nHe put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted\r\n      it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashëv. He paused,\r\n      looked ironically straight into Balashëv’s eyes, and said in a quiet\r\n      voice:\n“And yet what a splendid reign your mastermight have had!”\nBalashëv, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the Russian\r\n      side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was silent,\r\n      still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him.\r\n      Balashëv said that in Russia the best results were expected from the war.\r\n      Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, “I know it’s your duty to\r\n      say that, but you don’t believe it yourself. I have convinced you.”\nWhen Balashëv had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed at\r\n      it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door opened,\r\n      a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor his hat\r\n      and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon, without\r\n      giving them a glance, turned to Balashëv:\n“Assure the Emperor Alexander from me,” said he, taking his hat, “that I\r\n      am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly\r\n      esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you\r\n      shall receive my letter to the Emperor.”\nAnd Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room\r\n      rushed forward and descended the staircase."

    "text": "After all that Napoleon had said to him—those bursts of anger and\r\n      the last dryly spoken words: “I will detain you no longer, General; you\r\n      shall receive my letter,” Balashëv felt convinced that Napoleon would not\r\n      wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him—an\r\n      insulted envoy—especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger.\r\n      But, to his surprise, Balashëv received, through Duroc, an invitation to\r\n      dine with the Emperor that day.\nBessières, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.\nNapoleon met Balashëv cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign\r\n      of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,\r\n      but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashëv. It was evident that he\r\n      had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake,\r\n      and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not because it\r\n      harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but becausehedid it.\nThe Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vílna, where\r\n      crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all the\r\n      windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his\r\n      monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved their\r\n      handkerchiefs to him.\nAt dinner, having placed Balashëv beside him, Napoleon not only treated\r\n      him amiably but behaved as if Balashëv were one of his own courtiers, one\r\n      of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his\r\n      success. In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and questioned\r\n      Balashëv about the Russian capital, not merely as an interested traveler\r\n      asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as if convinced that\r\n      Balashëv, as a Russian, must be flattered by his curiosity.\n“How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true\r\n      that Moscow is called ‘Holy Moscow’? How many churches are there in\r\n      Moscow?” he asked.\nAnd receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches, he\r\n      remarked:\n“Why such a quantity of churches?”\n“The Russians are very devout,” replied Balashëv.\n“But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the\r\n      backwardness of a people,” said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for\r\n      appreciation of this remark.\nBalashëv respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.\n“Every country has its own character,” said he.\n“But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,” said Napoleon.\n“I beg your Majesty’s pardon,” returned Balashëv, “besides Russia there is\r\n      Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.”\nThis reply of Balashëv’s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the French\r\n      in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander’s court,\r\n      but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon’s dinner, where it passed\r\n      unnoticed.\nThe uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were\r\n      puzzled as to what Balashëv’s tone suggested. “If there is a point we\r\n      don’t see it, or it is not at all witty,” their expressions seemed to say.\r\n      So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not notice it at\r\n      all and naïvely asked Balashëv through what towns the direct road from\r\n      there to Moscow passed. Balashëv, who was on the alert all through the\r\n      dinner, replied that just as “all roads lead to Rome,” so all roads lead\r\n      to Moscow: there were many roads, and “among them the road throughPoltáva, which Charles XII chose.” Balashëv involuntarily flushed with\r\n      pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had he uttered the wordPoltávabefore Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from\r\n      Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences.\nAfter dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon’s study, which four\r\n      days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat down,\r\n      toying with his Sèvres coffee cup, and motioned Balashëv to a chair beside\r\n      him.\nNapoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than any\r\n      reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to\r\n      consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded by\r\n      men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner, Balashëv\r\n      too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a pleasant,\r\n      though slightly ironic, smile.\n“They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange,\r\n      isn’t it, General?” he said, evidently not doubting that this remark would\r\n      be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleon’s,\r\n      superiority to Alexander.\nBalashëv made no reply and bowed his head in silence.\n“Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were\r\n      deliberating,” continued Napoleon with the same derisive and\r\n      self-confident smile. “What I can’t understand,” he went on, “is that the\r\n      Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies. That I\r\n      do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?” and he\r\n      turned inquiringly to Balashëv, and evidently this thought turned him back\r\n      on to the track of his morning’s anger, which was still fresh in him.\n“And let him know that I will do so!” said Napoleon, rising and pushing\r\n      his cup away with his hand. “I’ll drive all his Württemberg, Baden, and\r\n      Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I’ll drive them out. Let him\r\n      prepare an asylum for them in Russia!”\nBalashëv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make\r\n      his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help hearing\r\n      what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression; he treated\r\n      Balashëv not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man now fully devoted to\r\n      him and who must rejoice at his former master’s humiliation.\n“And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What is\r\n      the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to reign and\r\n      not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a responsibility?”\nAgain Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and down\r\n      the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to\r\n      Balashëv and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly, and simply as\r\n      if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to Balashëv,\r\n      he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian general’s face and,\r\n      taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips only.\nTo have one’s ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest honor\r\n      and mark of favor at the French court.\n“Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don’t you say\r\n      anything?” said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the\r\n      adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. “Are the horses ready\r\n      for the general?” he added, with a slight inclination of his head in reply\r\n      to Balashëv’s bow. “Let him have mine, he has along way to go!”\nThe letter taken by Balashëv was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander.\r\n      Every detail of the interview was communicated to the Russian monarch, and\r\n      the war began...."

    "text": "After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to\r\n      Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet Anatole\r\n      Kurágin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching Petersburg he\r\n      inquired for Kurágin but the latter had already left the city. Pierre had\r\n      warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on his track. Anatole\r\n      Kurágin promptly obtained an appointment from the Minister of War and went\r\n      to join the army in Moldavia. While in Petersburg Prince Andrew met\r\n      Kutúzov, his former commander who was always well disposed toward him, and\r\n      Kutúzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to\r\n      which the old general had been appointed commander in chief. So Prince\r\n      Andrew, having received an appointment on the headquarters staff, left for\r\n      Turkey.\nPrince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kurágin. He\r\n      thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might\r\n      compromise the young Countess Rostóva and so he wanted to meet Kurágin\r\n      personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again\r\n      failed to meet Kurágin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived,\r\n      the latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions,\r\n      Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken\r\n      faith with him—which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to\r\n      conceal its effects—the surroundings in which he had been happy\r\n      became trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized\r\n      so highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the\r\n      thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the\r\n      field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which had\r\n      filled his solitude at Boguchárovo and then in Switzerland and Rome, but\r\n      he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they\r\n      had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters\r\n      unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more eagerly\r\n      the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if that lofty,\r\n      infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly\r\n      turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in which all was\r\n      clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.\nOf the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the\r\n      simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutúzov’s staff, he\r\n      applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised\r\n      Kutúzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found Kurágin\r\n      in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to Russia\r\n      after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might be before\r\n      he met Kurágin, despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he\r\n      deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict\r\n      with him—he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to\r\n      resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at\r\n      food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged, that his\r\n      rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial\r\n      tranquillity which he managed to obtain in Turkey by means of restless,\r\n      plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity.\nIn the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached Bucharest—where\r\n      Kutúzov had been living for two months, passing his days and nights with a\r\n      Wallachian woman—Prince Andrew asked Kutúzov to transfer him to the\r\n      Western Army. Kutúzov, who was already weary of Bolkónski’s activity which\r\n      seemed to reproach his own idleness, very readily let him go and gave him\r\n      a mission to Barclay de Tolly.\nBefore joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at\r\n      Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way,\r\n      being only two miles off the Smolénsk highroad. During the last three\r\n      years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt,\r\n      and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that on\r\n      reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the\r\n      way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail. He entered\r\n      through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading\r\n      to the house as if he were entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The\r\n      same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned\r\n      there, and inside there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds,\r\n      and smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Mary\r\n      was still the same timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and\r\n      joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant\r\n      suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish, self-satisfied\r\n      girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for\r\n      the future. She had merely become more self-confident, Prince Andrew\r\n      thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had brought from Switzerland, was wearing\r\n      a coat of Russian cut and talking broken Russian to the servants, but was\r\n      still the same narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic\r\n      preceptor. The old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a\r\n      tooth, which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character\r\n      he was the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and\r\n      skepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone\r\n      had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when\r\n      merry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty\r\n      little mouth just as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey\r\n      the law of immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though\r\n      externally all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people\r\n      had changed since Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was\r\n      divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for his\r\n      sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged the old\r\n      prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess\r\n      Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.\nDuring his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they were\r\n      ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an\r\n      exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward.\r\n      Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he was taciturn,\r\n      and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to\r\n      his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening, when Prince Andrew\r\n      went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to tell him of the young Count\r\n      Kámensky’s campaign, the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about\r\n      Princess Mary, blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said, was the only person really attached\r\n      to him.\nThe old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess\r\n      Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by indulgence\r\n      and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The old prince\r\n      knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very\r\n      hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she\r\n      deserved it. “Why does Prince Andrew, who sees this, say nothing to me\r\n      about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an old fool who,\r\n      without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this\r\n      Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn’t understand, so I must explain it, and\r\n      he must hear me out,” thought the old prince. And he began explaining why\r\n      he could not put up with his daughter’s unreasonable character.\n“If you ask me,” said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was censuring\r\n      his father for the first time in his life), “I did not wish to speak about\r\n      it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If there is any\r\n      misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can’t blame her for\r\n      it at all. I know how she loves and respects you. Since you ask me,”\r\n       continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable—as he was always liable\r\n      to do of late—“I can only say that if there are any\r\n      misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who is not fit\r\n      to be my sister’s companion.”\nThe old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile\r\n      disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could not\r\n      get accustomed.\n“What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You’ve already been talking it over!\r\n      Eh?”\n“Father, I did not want to judge,” said Prince Andrew, in a hard and\r\n      bitter tone, “but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall\r\n      say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame—the one to blame—is\r\n      that Frenchwoman.”\n“Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!” said the old man in a\r\n      low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment, but\r\n      then he suddenly jumped up and cried: “Be off, be off! Let not a trace of\r\n      you remain here!...”\n\nPrince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him to\r\n      stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not leave\r\n      his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and Tíkhon, but\r\n      asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day, before leaving,\r\n      Prince Andrew went to his son’s rooms. The boy, curly-headed like his\r\n      mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee, and Prince Andrew began\r\n      telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell into a reverie without\r\n      finishing the story. He thought not of this pretty child, his son whom he\r\n      held on his knee, but of himself. He sought in himself either remorse for\r\n      having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in\r\n      his life on bad terms with him, and was horrified to find neither. What\r\n      meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the\r\n      former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing\r\n      the boy and taking him on his knee.\n“Well, go on!” said his son.\nPrince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out\r\n      of the room.\nAs soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and\r\n      especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had\r\n      been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity, and\r\n      he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as\r\n      possible.\n“So you’ve decided to go, Andrew?” asked his sister.\n“Thank God that I can,” replied Prince Andrew. “I am very sorry you\r\n      can’t.”\n“Why do you say that?” replied Princess Mary. “Why do you say that, when\r\n      you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne says he has been asking about you....”\nAs soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears\r\n      began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.\n“Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what—what trash—can\r\n      cause people misery!” he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.\nShe understood that when speaking of “trash” he referred not only to\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who\r\n      had ruined his own happiness.\n“Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!” she said, touching his elbow\r\n      and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. “I understand\r\n      you” (she looked down). “Don’t imagine that sorrow is the work ofmen. Men\r\n      are His tools.” She looked a little above Prince Andrew’s head with the\r\n      confident, accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a\r\n      familiar portrait hangs. “Sorrow is sent byHim, not by men. Men are His\r\n      instruments, they are not to blame. If you think someone has wronged you,\r\n      forget it and forgive! We have no right to punish. And then you will know\r\n      the happiness of forgiving.”\n“If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman’s virtue. But a\r\n      man should not and cannot forgive and forget,” he replied, and though till\r\n      that moment he had not been thinking of Kurágin, all his unexpended anger\r\n      suddenly swelled up in his heart.\n“If Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long\r\n      ago to have punished him,” he thought. And giving her no further reply, he\r\n      began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet Kurágin\r\n      who he knew was now in the army.\nPrincess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how\r\n      unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to\r\n      him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again\r\n      from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the longer\r\n      he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.\n“Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men are\r\n      never to blame,” were the last words he heard from his sister when he took\r\n      leave of her.\n“Then it must be so!” thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the avenue\r\n      from the house at Bald Hills. “She, poor innocent creature, is left to be\r\n      victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old man feels he\r\n      is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up and rejoices in\r\n      life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived. And I\r\n      am off to the army. Why? I myself don’t know. I want to meet that man whom\r\n      I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me!”\nThese conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were all\r\n      connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless\r\n      things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to\r\n      Prince Andrew’s mind."

    "text": "Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of\r\n      June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified\r\n      camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a\r\n      junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large\r\n      French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of\r\n      affairs in the Russian army, but no one anticipated any danger of invasion\r\n      of the Russian provinces, and no one thought the war would extend farther\r\n      than the western, the Polish, provinces.\nPrince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on the\r\n      bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large village in the\r\n      vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and courtiers\r\n      accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on\r\n      both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay de Tolly was\r\n      quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received Bolkónski\r\n      stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would\r\n      mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment, but asked\r\n      him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kurágin, whom Prince Andrew\r\n      had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had gone to Petersburg,\r\n      but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind was occupied by the\r\n      interests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war, and he was\r\n      glad to be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of\r\n      Kurágin. During the first four days, while no duties were required of him,\r\n      Prince Andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his\r\n      own knowledge and by talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion\r\n      about it. But the question whether the camp was advantageous or\r\n      disadvantageous remained for him undecided. Already from his military\r\n      experience and what he had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to\r\n      the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no\r\n      significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the\r\n      enemy—that cannot be foreseen—are met, and on how and by whom\r\n      the whole matter is handled. To clear up this last point for himself,\r\n      Prince Andrew, utilizing his position and acquaintances, tried to fathom\r\n      the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties\r\n      engaged in it, and he deduced for himself the following of the state of\r\n      affairs.\nWhile the Emperor had still been at Vílna, the forces had been divided\r\n      into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the\r\n      army under Bagratión, and thirdly, the one commanded by Tormásov. The\r\n      Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the\r\n      orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command, but\r\n      only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had with him\r\n      not a commander in chief’s staff but the imperial headquarters staff. In\r\n      attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff, Quartermaster\r\n      General Prince Volkónski, as well as generals, imperial aides-de-camp,\r\n      diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners, but not the army\r\n      staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the Emperor without any\r\n      definite appointments: Arakchéev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bennigsen,\r\n      the senior general in rank; the Grand Duke Tsarévich Constantine\r\n      Pávlovich; Count Rumyántsev, the Chancellor; Stein, a former Prussian\r\n      minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan\r\n      of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general and Sardinianémigré; Wolzogen—and\r\n      many others. Though these men had no military appointment in the army,\r\n      their position gave them influence, and often a corps commander, or even\r\n      the commander in chief, did not know in what capacity he was questioned by\r\n      Bennigsen, the Grand Duke, Arakchéev, or Prince Volkónski, or was given\r\n      this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in\r\n      the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the Emperor\r\n      and whether it had to be executed or not. But this was only the external\r\n      condition; the essential significance of the presence of the Emperor and\r\n      of all these people, from a courtier’s point of view (and in an Emperor’s\r\n      vicinity all became courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the\r\n      Emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of\r\n      all the armies; the men around him were his assistants. Arakchéev was a\r\n      faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign’s\r\n      bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vílna province who appeared to\r\n      be doing the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general,\r\n      useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke\r\n      was there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there\r\n      because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high\r\n      esteem personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general\r\n      full of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.\r\n      Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The\r\n      adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the Emperor,\r\n      and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of\r\n      campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to believe in the\r\n      efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business of the war. With\r\n      Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel’s thoughts in a more\r\n      comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish theorist,\r\n      self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was able to do.\nBesides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected\r\n      ideas every day—especially the foreigners, who did so with a\r\n      boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own—there\r\n      were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their\r\n      principals were there.\nAmong the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant, and\r\n      proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined\r\n      subdivisions of tendencies and parties:\nThe first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents—military\r\n      theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws—laws\r\n      of oblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents\r\n      demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with\r\n      precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only\r\n      barbarism, ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that\r\n      theory. To this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen,\r\n      Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans.\nThe second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as always\r\n      happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of this\r\n      party were those who had demanded an advance from Vílna into Poland and\r\n      freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold\r\n      action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still\r\n      more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagratión, Ermólov (who\r\n      was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a famous\r\n      joke of Ermólov’s was being circulated, that as a great favor he had\r\n      petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party,\r\n      remembering Suvórov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or\r\n      stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of\r\n      Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.\nTo the third party—in which the Emperor had most confidence—belonged\r\n      the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The\r\n      members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakchéev belonged,\r\n      thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have\r\n      some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly against\r\n      such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now), needs most\r\n      deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect\r\n      Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that\r\n      the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one should not trust them\r\n      absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel’s opponents and practical\r\n      men of experience in warfare had to say, and then choose a middle course.\r\n      They insisted on the retention of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel’s\r\n      plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies. Though, by this\r\n      course, neither one aim nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed\r\n      best to the adherents of this third party.\nOf a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the Tsarévich,\r\n      who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where he had\r\n      ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry uniform as\r\n      to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but unexpectedly\r\n      finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general\r\n      confusion. The men of this party had both the quality and the defect of\r\n      frankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon, recognized his strength\r\n      and their own weakness, and frankly said so. They said: “Nothing but\r\n      sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this! We have abandoned Vílna and\r\n      Vítebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only reasonable thing left to do is\r\n      to conclude peace as soon as possible, before we are turned out of\r\n      Petersburg.”\nThis view was very general in the upper army circles and found support\r\n      also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyántsev, who, for other\r\n      reasons of state, was in favor of peace.\nThe fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de Tolly,\r\n      not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief. “Be he\r\n      what he may” (they always began like that), “he is an honest, practical\r\n      man and we have nobody better. Give him real power, for war cannot be\r\n      conducted successfully without unity of command, and he will show what he\r\n      can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well organized and strong and\r\n      has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering any defeats, we owe this\r\n      entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to be superseded by Bennigsen all\r\n      will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 1807.”\nThe sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any\r\n      rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: “and\r\n      twist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually. Let\r\n      the others make mistakes now!” said they, arguing that our retirement to\r\n      Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders.\r\n      “The more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any rate be\r\n      understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this. What is\r\n      wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen, who made\r\n      his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice—a man\r\n      whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only\r\n      such man.”\nThe seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be\r\n      found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were\r\n      particularly many round Alexander—generals and imperial\r\n      aides-de-camp passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch\r\n      but as a man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as Rostóv had\r\n      done in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human\r\n      capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign for\r\n      refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive\r\n      modesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should\r\n      abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at\r\n      the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chief’s staff, and,\r\n      consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary,\r\n      would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be raised to\r\n      the highest pitch.\nThe eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the\r\n      others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither peace\r\n      nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa or anywhere\r\n      else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor Bennigsen, but\r\n      only the one most essential thing—as much advantage and pleasure for\r\n      themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of conflicting and\r\n      intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor’s headquarters, it\r\n      was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times. A man who\r\n      simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with Pfuel,\r\n      tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after, merely to avoid\r\n      responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare that he had no\r\n      opinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to gain some advantage\r\n      would attract the Emperor’s attention by loudly advocating the very thing\r\n      the Emperor had hinted at the day before, and would dispute and shout at\r\n      the council, beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree\r\n      with him to duels, thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice\r\n      himself for the common good. A third, in the absence of opponents, between\r\n      two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful\r\n      services, well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to\r\n      refuse him. A fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often\r\n      come accidentally under the Emperor’s eye. A fifth, to achieve his\r\n      long-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly insist on\r\n      the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this\r\n      object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct.\nAll the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and\r\n      promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial\r\n      favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole\r\n      drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it was\r\n      all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the\r\n      uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving a\r\n      peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of\r\n      intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity of\r\n      race among these people—this eighth and largest party of those\r\n      preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity\r\n      to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these drones,\r\n      without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew over to\r\n      the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who\r\n      were disputing honestly.\nFrom among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached the\r\n      army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning to raise\r\n      its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men experienced\r\n      and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of those\r\n      conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what was going\r\n      on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this\r\n      muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.\nThe men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted\r\n      chiefly from the Emperor’s presence in the army with his military court\r\n      and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional, and\r\n      unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but harmful\r\n      in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the army, and\r\n      that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor and his\r\n      court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed\r\n      the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety,\r\n      and that the worst commander in chief, if independent, would be better\r\n      than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the\r\n      monarch.\nJust at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa, Shishkóv,\r\n      the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of this party,\r\n      wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakchéev and Balashëv agreed to sign.\r\n      In this letter, availing himself of permission given him by the Emperor to\r\n      discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully suggested—on\r\n      the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike\r\n      spirit in the people of the capital—that the Emperor should leave\r\n      the army.\nThat arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to\r\n      defend their country—the very incitement which was the chief cause\r\n      of Russia’s triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsar’s personal\r\n      presence in Moscow—was suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by\r\n      him, as a pretext for quitting the army."

    "text": "This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one\r\n      day at dinner, informed Bolkónski that the sovereign wished to see him\r\n      personally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to\r\n      present himself at Bennigsen’s quarters at six that evening.\nNews was received at the Emperor’s quarters that very day of a fresh\r\n      movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army—news subsequently\r\n      found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the\r\n      Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that\r\n      this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered a\r\n      chef-d’oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleon’s\r\n      destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the Russian\r\n      army.\nPrince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen’s quarters—a country gentleman’s\r\n      house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither\r\n      Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernýshev, the Emperor’s\r\n      aide-de-camp, received Bolkónski and informed him that the Emperor,\r\n      accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second\r\n      time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the\r\n      suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.\nChernýshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel\r\n      in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still an\r\n      organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood the\r\n      folding bedstead of Bennigsen’s adjutant. This adjutant was also there and\r\n      sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by work or by\r\n      feasting. Two doors led from the room, one straight on into what had been\r\n      the drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study. Through the\r\n      first door came the sound of voices conversing in German and occasionally\r\n      in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by the Emperor’s wish, not\r\n      a military council (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness), but certain\r\n      persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending\r\n      difficulties. It was not a council of war, but, as it were, a council to\r\n      elucidate certain questions for the Emperor personally. To this\r\n      semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General Armfeldt, Adjutant\r\n      General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had referred to as a\r\n      renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein who was not a\r\n      military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince Andrew had heard,\r\n      was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew had an opportunity\r\n      of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon after himself and,\r\n      in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a minute to speak to\r\n      Chernýshev.\nAt first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general, which\r\n      fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince Andrew,\r\n      though he saw him now for the first time. There was about him something of\r\n      Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German theorist-generals whom\r\n      Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more typical than any of them.\r\n      Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German theorist in whom all the\r\n      characteristics of those others were united to such an extent.\nPfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build,\r\n      broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was much\r\n      wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily\r\n      brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint\r\n      little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and angrily around,\r\n      as if afraid of everything in that large apartment. Awkwardly holding up\r\n      his sword, he addressed Chernýshev and asked in German where the Emperor\r\n      was. One could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as\r\n      possible, finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down to business in\r\n      front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded hurriedly in reply\r\n      to Chernýshev, and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was\r\n      inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had planned in accord with\r\n      his theory. He muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice,\r\n      as self-assured Germans do—it might have been “stupid fellow”... or\r\n      “the whole affair will be ruined,” or “something absurd will come of\r\n      it.”... Prince Andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on,\r\n      but Chernýshev introduced him to Pfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was\r\n      just back from Turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel\r\n      barely glanced—not so much at Prince Andrew as past him—and\r\n      said, with a laugh: “That must have been a fine tactical war”; and,\r\n      laughing contemptuously, went on into the room from which the sound of\r\n      voices was heard.\nPfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly\r\n      disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect\r\n      and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with\r\n      Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to\r\n      form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and\r\n      immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of martyrdom as\r\n      only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of\r\n      an abstract notion—science, that is, the supposed knowledge of\r\n      absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself\r\n      personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly attractive to men and\r\n      women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the\r\n      best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an Englishman always\r\n      knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is\r\n      undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable\r\n      and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian is self-assured\r\n      just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything, since he\r\n      does not believe that anything can be known. The German’s self-assurance\r\n      is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he\r\n      imagines that he knows the truth—science—which he himself has\r\n      invented but which is for him the absolute truth.\nPfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science—the theory of\r\n      oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great’s\r\n      wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed\r\n      to him absurd and barbarous—monstrous collisions in which so many\r\n      blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called\r\n      wars, they did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve\r\n      as material for science.\nIn 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of campaign\r\n      that ended in Jena and Auerstädt, but he did not see the least proof of\r\n      the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On the\r\n      contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion, the\r\n      sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically gleeful\r\n      sarcasm he would remark, “There, I said the whole affair would go to the\r\n      devil!” Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that\r\n      they lose sight of the theory’s object—its practical application.\r\n      His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and he would not\r\n      listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures resulting from\r\n      deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of\r\n      his theory.\nHe said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernýshev about the present war,\r\n      with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong, and who\r\n      is not displeased that it should be so. The unbrushed tufts of hair\r\n      sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed\r\n      this most eloquently.\nHe passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his voice\r\n      were at once heard from there."

    "text": "Prince Andrew’s eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when Count\r\n      Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkónski, but not pausing,\r\n      went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he went. The\r\n      Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on to make some\r\n      preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign. Chernýshev and\r\n      Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor, who looked\r\n      fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to him with\r\n      particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the left, was\r\n      listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward evidently\r\n      wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited Italian,\r\n      oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.\n“And as for the man who advised forming this camp—the Drissa camp,”\r\n       said Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew\r\n      scanned his unfamiliar face, “as to that person, sire...” continued\r\n      Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself, “the man who\r\n      advised the Drissa camp—I see no alternative but the lunatic asylum\r\n      or the gallows!”\nWithout heeding the end of the Italian’s remarks, and as though not\r\n      hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkónski, addressed him\r\n      graciously.\n“I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait\r\n      for me.”\nThe Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter\r\n      Mikháylovich Volkónski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them.\r\n      Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor’s permission, accompanied\r\n      Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the\r\n      council was assembled.\nPrince Peter Mikháylovich Volkónski occupied the position, as it were, of\r\n      chief of the Emperor’s staff. He came out of the study into the drawing\r\n      room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put questions on which\r\n      he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present. What had happened\r\n      was that news (which afterwards proved to be false) had been received\r\n      during the night of a movement by the French to outflank the Drissa camp.\nThe first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that\r\n      presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from\r\n      the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was inexplicable\r\n      (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an opinion), but he\r\n      urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy.\r\n      It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now\r\n      expounded it not so much to answer the questions put—which, in fact,\r\n      his plan did not answer—as to avail himself of the opportunity to\r\n      air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as good as another,\r\n      that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war\r\n      would take. Some disputed his arguments, others defended them. Young Count\r\n      Toll objected to the Swedish general’s views more warmly than anyone else,\r\n      and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled\r\n      notebook, which he asked permission to read to them. In these voluminous\r\n      notes Toll suggested another scheme, totally different from Armfeldt’s or\r\n      Pfuel’s plan of campaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance\r\n      and an attack, which, he urged, could alone extricate us from the present\r\n      uncertainty and from the trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we\r\n      were situated.\nDuring all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen (his\r\n      “bridge” in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted\r\n      contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean himself\r\n      by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when Prince\r\n      Volkónski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his opinion, he\r\n      merely said:\n“Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an\r\n      exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman’s attack—very fine,\r\n      or a retreat, also good! Why ask me?” said he. “Why, you yourselves know\r\n      everything better than I do.”\nBut when Volkónski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperor’s name\r\n      that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated,\r\n      began to speak:\n“Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they\r\n      knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There is\r\n      nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly adhered\r\n      to,” said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. “What is the\r\n      difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!”\nHe went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no\r\n      eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that everything\r\n      had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it,\r\n      the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.\nPaulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French.\r\n      Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly, and\r\n      began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who was\r\n      rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all that\r\n      could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there were now\r\n      any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not\r\n      been precisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he demonstrated,\r\n      and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician who\r\n      ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already\r\n      been proved. Wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in\r\n      French, every now and then turning to Pfuel and saying, “Is it not so,\r\n      your excellency?” But Pfuel, like a man heated in a fight who strikes\r\n      those on his own side, shouted angrily at his own supporter, Wolzogen:\n“Well, of course, what more is there to explain?”\nPaulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French.\r\n      Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to Volkónski in\r\n      Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.\nOf all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,\r\n      determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present,\r\n      evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no hatred\r\n      against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a theory arrived\r\n      at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was ridiculous, and\r\n      unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his\r\n      boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks of all except\r\n      Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of\r\n      war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon’s genius, which,\r\n      though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was\r\n      assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him from every side,\r\n      and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other’s proposals. Pfuel\r\n      alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who\r\n      opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of respect, Pfuel evoked pity\r\n      in Prince Andrew. From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and\r\n      the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor, but\r\n      above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel’s own expressions, it was\r\n      clear that the others knew, and Pfuel himself felt, that his fall was at\r\n      hand. And despite his self-confidence and grumpy German sarcasm he was\r\n      pitiable, with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in\r\n      tufts behind. Though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and\r\n      contempt, he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of\r\n      verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the\r\n      whole world was slipping away from him.\nThe discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted the more\r\n      heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and personalities, and\r\n      the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that\r\n      had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this polyglot talk and to these\r\n      surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts, felt nothing but amazement at\r\n      what they were saying. A thought that had long since and often occurred to\r\n      him during his military activities—the idea that there is not and\r\n      cannot be any science of war, and that therefore there can be no such\r\n      thing as a military genius—now appeared to him an obvious truth.\r\n      “What theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and\r\n      circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined, especially when\r\n      the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is\r\n      able to foresee in what condition our or the enemy’s armies will be in a\r\n      day’s time, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment.\r\n      Sometimes—when there is not a coward at the front to shout, ‘We are\r\n      cut off!’ and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who shouts,\r\n      ‘Hurrah!’—a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand, as\r\n      at Schön Grabern, while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand,\r\n      as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a matter in which, as in\r\n      all practical matters, nothing can be defined and everything depends on\r\n      innumerable conditions, the significance of which is determined at a\r\n      particular moment which arrives no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army\r\n      is cut in half, and Paulucci says we have got the French army between two\r\n      fires; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in\r\n      having the river behind it, and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its\r\n      strength; Toll proposes one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good\r\n      and all bad, and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the\r\n      moment of trial. And why do they all speak of a ‘military genius’? Is a\r\n      man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and\r\n      say who is to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because\r\n      military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants\r\n      flatter power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess.\r\n      The best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or\r\n      absent-minded men. Bagratión was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that.\r\n      And of Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on\r\n      the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any\r\n      special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and\r\n      best human attributes—love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic\r\n      inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he is\r\n      doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient patience),\r\n      and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he should be\r\n      humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just and unjust. It is\r\n      understandable that a theory of their ‘genius’ was invented for them long\r\n      ago because they have power! The success of a military action depends not\r\n      on them, but on the man in the ranks who shouts, ‘We are lost!’ or who\r\n      shouts, ‘Hurrah!’ And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of\r\n      being useful.”\nSo thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused\r\n      himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.\nAt the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would like\r\n      to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles forever by\r\n      not asking to remain attached to the sovereign’s person, but for\r\n      permission to serve in the army."

    "text": "Before the beginning of the campaign, Rostóv had received a letter from\r\n      his parents in which they told him briefly of Natásha’s illness and the\r\n      breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by\r\n      Natásha’s having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from the\r\n      army and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not even make\r\n      any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army, but wrote\r\n      to his parents that he was sorry Natásha was ill and her engagement broken\r\n      off, and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes. To Sónya he\r\n      wrote separately.\n“Adored friend of my soul!” he wrote. “Nothing but honor could keep me\r\n      from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the\r\n      campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades’ eyes but in\r\n      my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the\r\n      Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly\r\n      the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will throw\r\n      up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent breast.”\nIt was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented\r\n      Rostóv from returning home as he had promised and marrying Sónya. The\r\n      autumn in Otrádnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas\r\n      holidays and Sónya’s love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil rural\r\n      joys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now allured\r\n      him. “A splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a dozen leashes of\r\n      smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by election...” thought he.\r\n      But now the campaign was beginning, and he had to remain with his\r\n      regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas Rostóv, as was natural to\r\n      him, felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to\r\n      find pleasure in that life.\nOn his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed by\r\n      his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the\r\n      Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation\r\n      from his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain, and\r\n      when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers, he\r\n      was again allotted his old squadron.\nThe campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay, new\r\n      officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was infected\r\n      with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war,\r\n      and Rostóv, conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment,\r\n      devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military\r\n      service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish\r\n      them.\nThe troops retired from Vílna for various complicated reasons of state,\r\n      political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by a\r\n      complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at\r\n      headquarters. For the Pávlograd hussars, however, the whole of this\r\n      retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies\r\n      was a very simple and agreeable business.\nIt was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and\r\n      intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they\r\n      were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only\r\n      because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some\r\n      pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced to\r\n      enter anyone’s head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier\r\n      and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of the task\r\n      nearest to hand. First they camped gaily before Vílna, making acquaintance\r\n      with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being reviewed by\r\n      the Emperor and other high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to\r\n      Sventsyáni and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them.\r\n      Sventsyáni was remembered by the hussars only as thedrunken camp, a name\r\n      the whole army gave to their encampment there, and because many complaints\r\n      were made against the troops, who, taking advantage of the order to\r\n      collect provisions, took also horses, carriages, and carpets from the\r\n      Polish proprietors. Rostóv remembered Sventsyáni, because on the first day\r\n      of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was\r\n      unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who, unknown to him,\r\n      had appropriated five barrels of old beer. From Sventsyáni they retired\r\n      farther and farther to Drissa, and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing\r\n      near to the frontier of Russia proper.\nOn the thirteenth of July the Pávlograds took part in a serious action for\r\n      the first time.\nOn the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy storm\r\n      of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its\r\n      storms.\nThe two Pávlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which was\r\n      already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses.\r\n      The rain was descending in torrents, and Rostóv, with a young officer\r\n      named Ilyín, his protégé, was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter. An\r\n      officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending onto his cheeks,\r\n      who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain, entered\r\n      Rostóv’s shelter.\n“I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Raévski’s exploit?”\nAnd the officer gave them details of the Saltánov battle, which he had\r\n      heard at the staff.\nRostóv, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled\r\n      down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional glance at Ilyín,\r\n      who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad of sixteen who had\r\n      recently joined the regiment, was now in the same relation to Nicholas\r\n      that Nicholas had been to Denísov seven years before. Ilyín tried to\r\n      imitate Rostóv in everything and adored him as a girl might have done.\nZdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of\r\n      the Saltánov dam being “a Russian Thermopylae,” and of how a deed worthy\r\n      of antiquity had been performed by General Raévski. He recounted how\r\n      Raévski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had\r\n      charged with them beside him. Rostóv heard the story and not only said\r\n      nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski’s enthusiasm but, on the contrary, looked\r\n      like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no intention of\r\n      contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostóv\r\n      knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits,\r\n      as he himself had done when recounting them; besides that, he had\r\n      experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can\r\n      imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski’s tale, nor did he\r\n      like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches extending over his cheeks,\r\n      bent low over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, and crowded Rostóv\r\n      in the narrow shanty. Rostóv looked at him in silence. “In the first\r\n      place, there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that\r\n      was being attacked that if Raévski did lead his sons there, it could have\r\n      had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him,” thought\r\n      he, “the rest could not have seen how or with whom Raévski came onto the\r\n      dam. And even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by\r\n      it, for what had they to do with Raévski’s tender paternal feelings when\r\n      their own skins were in danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland\r\n      did not depend on whether they took the Saltánov dam or not, as we are\r\n      told was the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a\r\n      sacrifice? And why expose his own children in the battle? I would not have\r\n      taken my brother Pétya there, or even Ilyín, who’s a stranger to me but a\r\n      nice lad, but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover,”\r\n       Nicholas continued to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not\r\n      express his thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience.\r\n      He knew that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had\r\n      to pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.\n“I can’t stand this any more,” said Ilyín, noticing that Rostóv did not\r\n      relish Zdrzhinski’s conversation. “My stockings and shirt... and the water\r\n      is running on my seat! I’ll go and look for shelter. The rain seems less\r\n      heavy.”\nIlyín went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.\nFive minutes later Ilyín, splashing through the mud, came running back to\r\n      the shanty.\n“Hurrah! Rostóv, come quick! I’ve found it! About two hundred yards away\r\n      there’s a tavern whereourshave already gathered. We can at least get dry\r\n      there, and Mary Hendríkhovna’s there.”\nMary Hendríkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty young\r\n      German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from lack of\r\n      means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the early\r\n      days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the hussar\r\n      regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among the hussar\r\n      officers.\nRostóv threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrúshka to follow\r\n      with the things, and—now slipping in the mud, now splashing right\r\n      through it—set off with Ilyín in the lessening rain and the darkness\r\n      that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.\n“Rostóv, where are you?”\n“Here. What lightning!” they called to one another."

    "text": "In the tavern, before which stood the doctor’s covered cart, there were\r\n      already some five officers. Mary Hendríkhovna, a plump little blonde\r\n      German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench in\r\n      the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her. Rostóv\r\n      and Ilyín, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts and\r\n      laughter.\n“Dear me, how jolly we are!” said Rostóv laughing.\n“And why do you stand there gaping?”\n“What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don’t make our\r\n      drawing room so wet.”\n“Don’t mess Mary Hendríkhovna’s dress!” cried other voices.\nRostóv and Ilyín hastened to find a corner where they could change into\r\n      dry clothes without offending Mary Hendríkhovna’s modesty. They were going\r\n      into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it completely\r\n      filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary\r\n      candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no account yield their\r\n      position. Mary Hendríkhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to\r\n      be used as a curtain, and behind that screen Rostóv and Ilyín, helped by\r\n      Lavrúshka who had brought their kits, changed their wet things for dry\r\n      ones.\nA fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found,\r\n      fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was\r\n      produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary\r\n      Hendríkhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a\r\n      clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket\r\n      under her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat\r\n      over the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies off\r\n      her husband’s face, lest he should wake up.\n“Leave him alone,” said Mary Hendríkhovna, smiling timidly and happily.\r\n      “He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.”\n“Oh, no, Mary Hendríkhovna,” replied the officer, “one must look after the\r\n      doctor. Perhaps he’ll take pity on me someday, when it comes to cutting\r\n      off a leg or an arm for me.”\nThere were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could not\r\n      make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held only six\r\n      tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in\r\n      order of seniority to receive one’s tumbler from Mary Hendríkhovna’s plump\r\n      little hands with their short and not overclean nails. All the officers\r\n      appeared to be, and really were, in love with her that evening. Even those\r\n      playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to\r\n      the samovar, yielding to the general mood of courting Mary Hendríkhovna.\r\n      She, seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men,\r\n      beamed with satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as\r\n      she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her.\nThere was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything else, but\r\n      it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary Hendríkhovna\r\n      should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostóv received his tumbler,\r\n      and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendríkhovna to stir it.\n“But you take it without sugar?” she said, smiling all the time, as if\r\n      everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and\r\n      had a double meaning.\n“It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir my\r\n      tea.”\nMary Hendríkhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone\r\n      meanwhile had pounced on.\n“Use your finger, Mary Hendríkhovna, it will be still nicer,” said Rostóv.\n“Too hot!” she replied, blushing with pleasure.\nIlyín put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to\r\n      Mary Hendríkhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.\n“This is my cup,” said he. “Only dip your finger in it and I’ll drink it\r\n      all up.”\nWhen they had emptied the samovar, Rostóv took a pack of cards and\r\n      proposed that they should play “Kings” with Mary Hendríkhovna. They drew\r\n      lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostóv’s suggestion it was\r\n      agreed that whoever became “King” should have the right to kiss Mary\r\n      Hendríkhovna’s hand, and that the “Booby” should go to refill and reheat\r\n      the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.\n“Well, but supposing Mary Hendríkhovna is ‘King’?” asked Ilyín.\n“As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!”\nThey had hardly begun to play before the doctor’s disheveled head suddenly\r\n      appeared from behind Mary Hendríkhovna. He had been awake for some time,\r\n      listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing entertaining\r\n      or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and depressed. Without\r\n      greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to\r\n      pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he had left the room all\r\n      the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary Hendríkhovna blushed till\r\n      her eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive to\r\n      them. Returning from the yard, the doctor told his wife (who had ceased to\r\n      smile so happily, and looked at him in alarm, awaiting her sentence) that\r\n      the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart, or\r\n      everything in it would be stolen.\n“But I’ll send an orderly.... Two of them!” said Rostóv. “What an idea,\r\n      doctor!”\n“I’ll stand guard on it myself!” said Ilyín.\n“No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two\r\n      nights,” replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife,\r\n      waiting for the game to end.\nSeeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew still\r\n      merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for which they\r\n      hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking his wife\r\n      with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart, the\r\n      officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their wet\r\n      cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged\r\n      remarks, recalling the doctor’s uneasiness and his wife’s delight, now\r\n      they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the\r\n      covered trap. Several times Rostóv, covering his head, tried to go to\r\n      sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed,\r\n      to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter."

    "text": "It was nearly three o’clock but no one was yet asleep, when the\r\n      quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of\r\n      Ostróvna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly getting\r\n      ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But Rostóv went\r\n      off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was breaking, the rain\r\n      had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt damp and cold,\r\n      especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left the tavern in\r\n      the twilight of the dawn, Rostóv and Ilyín both glanced under the wet and\r\n      glistening leather hood of the doctor’s cart, from under the apron of\r\n      which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle of which his wife’s\r\n      nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible.\n“She really is a dear little thing,” said Rostóv to Ilyín, who was\r\n      following him.\n“A charming woman!” said Ilyín, with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen.\nHalf an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command was\r\n      heard to “mount” and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted. Rostóv\r\n      riding in front gave the order “Forward!” and the hussars, with clanking\r\n      sabers and subdued talk, their horses’ hoofs splashing in the mud, defiled\r\n      in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each\r\n      side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front.\nTattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding before\r\n      the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass which\r\n      always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still wet with\r\n      the night’s rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also wet, swayed\r\n      in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side. The\r\n      soldiers’ faces were more and more clearly visible. Rostóv, always closely\r\n      followed by Ilyín, rode along the side of the road between two rows of\r\n      birch trees.\nWhen campaigning, Rostóv allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a\r\n      regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman, he had\r\n      lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Donéts horse,\r\n      dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could\r\n      outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought of\r\n      the horse, of the morning, of the doctor’s wife, but not once of the\r\n      impending danger.\nFormerly, when going into action, Rostóv had felt afraid; now he had not\r\n      the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown used\r\n      to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because he had\r\n      learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown accustomed\r\n      when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most\r\n      likely to interest him—the impending danger. During the first period\r\n      of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with\r\n      cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time it had come of\r\n      itself. Now he rode beside Ilyín under the birch trees, occasionally\r\n      plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes touching his\r\n      horse’s side with his foot, or, without turning round, handing a pipe he\r\n      had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as calm and careless an\r\n      air as though he were merely out for a ride. He glanced with pity at the\r\n      excited face of Ilyín, who talked much and in great agitation. He knew\r\n      from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet\r\n      was suffering and knew that only time could help him.\nAs soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds,\r\n      the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning\r\n      after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and\r\n      all was still. The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared\r\n      behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it\r\n      reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its\r\n      edge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as if\r\n      in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.\nBefore Rostóv had had time to consider and determine the distance of that\r\n      firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstóy’s adjutant came galloping from Vítebsk\r\n      with orders to advance at a trot along the road.\nThe squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery—which\r\n      had also quickened their pace—rode down a hill, and passing through\r\n      an empty and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather\r\n      and the men to flush.\n“Halt! Dress your ranks!” the order of the regimental commander was heard\r\n      ahead. “Forward by the left. Walk, march!” came the order from in front.\nAnd the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our\r\n      position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To the\r\n      right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve. Higher\r\n      up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through the\r\n      wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams.\r\n      In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy’s columns and\r\n      guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard briskly\r\n      exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.\nAt these sounds, long unheard, Rostóv’s spirits rose, as at the strains of\r\n      the merriest music.Trap-ta-ta-tap!cracked the shots, now together, now\r\n      several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then again it\r\n      sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them.\nThe hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade\r\n      began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron, halted,\r\n      spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to the guns.\nAfter Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.\n“Form column! Prepare to charge!”\nThe infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry to\r\n      pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering, and\r\n      trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to the\r\n      left.\nAs soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up the\r\n      hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by the\r\n      Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but fell spent\r\n      without taking effect.\nThe sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more\r\n      pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostóv than the previous sounds of\r\n      firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out\r\n      before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement of\r\n      the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something\r\n      confused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our Uhlans\r\n      were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more to the\r\n      left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and behind\r\n      them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could be seen."

    "text": "Rostóv, with his keen sportsman’s eye, was one of the first to catch sight\r\n      of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and nearer in\r\n      disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons pursuing them.\r\n      He could already see how these men, who looked so small at the foot of the\r\n      hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their arms and their sabers\r\n      in the air.\nRostóv gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt\r\n      instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the\r\n      latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must be\r\n      done now, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked around.\r\n      A captain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on\r\n      the cavalry below them.\n“Andrew Sevastyánych!” said Rostóv. “You know, we could crush them....”\n“A fine thing too!” replied the captain, “and really...”\nRostóv, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to\r\n      the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the\r\n      word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following\r\n      him. Rostóv himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he did\r\n      when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons near\r\n      and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not withstand\r\n      an attack—knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip\r\n      it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so\r\n      stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could\r\n      not restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command, and\r\n      immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed\r\n      squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons. Hardly had they\r\n      reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to\r\n      a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our Uhlans\r\n      and the French dragoons who galloped after them. The dragoons were now\r\n      close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the foremost began to turn, while\r\n      those behind began to halt. With the same feeling with which he had\r\n      galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostóv gave rein to his Donéts horse\r\n      and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons’ disordered lines. One\r\n      Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to\r\n      avoid being knocked over, and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars.\r\n      Nearly all the French dragoons were galloping back. Rostóv, picking out\r\n      one on a gray horse, dashed after him. On the way he came upon a bush, his\r\n      gallant horse cleared it, and almost before he had righted himself in his\r\n      saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had\r\n      selected. That Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a\r\n      gallop, crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In\r\n      another moment Rostóv’s horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters\r\n      of the officer’s horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same instant\r\n      Rostóv, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman\r\n      with it.\nThe instant he had done this, all Rostóv’s animation vanished. The officer\r\n      fell, not so much from the blow—which had but slightly cut his arm\r\n      above the elbow—as from the shock to his horse and from fright.\r\n      Rostóv reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had\r\n      vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the\r\n      ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed up with\r\n      fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at Rostóv with\r\n      shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained face—fair and young, with\r\n      a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes—was not an enemy’s face at\r\n      all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face. Before\r\n      Rostóv had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, “I surrender!”\r\n       He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did\r\n      not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostóv’s face. Some hussars who\r\n      galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle. On all\r\n      sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was wounded, but\r\n      though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his horse; another was\r\n      perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him; a third was being\r\n      helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the French infantry were\r\n      firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily back with their\r\n      prisoners. Rostóv galloped back with the rest, aware of an unpleasant\r\n      feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and confused, which he\r\n      could not at all account for, had come over him with the capture of that\r\n      officer and the blow he had dealt him.\nCount Ostermann-Tolstóy met the returning hussars, sent for Rostóv,\r\n      thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor and\r\n      would recommend him for a St. George’s Cross. When sent for by Count\r\n      Ostermann, Rostóv, remembering that he had charged without orders, felt\r\n      sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of\r\n      discipline. Ostermann’s flattering words and promise of a reward should\r\n      therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt that\r\n      same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. “But what on earth is\r\n      worrying me?” he asked himself as he rode back from the general. “Ilyín?\r\n      No, he’s safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No, that’s not it.”\r\n       Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. “Yes, oh yes, that\r\n      French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm paused when I\r\n      raised it.”\nRostóv saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a\r\n      look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was sitting in his\r\n      foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him. The\r\n      sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He glanced at\r\n      Rostóv with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting. Rostóv still\r\n      had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.\nAll that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that Rostóv,\r\n      without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied. He\r\n      drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something over\r\n      in his mind.\nRostóv was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to\r\n      his amazement had gained him the St. George’s Cross and even given him a\r\n      reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all\r\n      understand. “So others are even more afraid than I am!” he thought. “So\r\n      that’s all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my\r\n      country’s sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes?\r\n      And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should I\r\n      kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. George’s\r\n      Cross.... I can’t make it out at all.”\nBut while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach\r\n      no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the\r\n      service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at\r\n      Ostróvna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar\r\n      battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen."

    "text": "On receiving news of Natásha’s illness, the countess, though not quite\r\n      well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with Pétya and the rest of the\r\n      household, and the whole family moved from Márya Dmítrievna’s house to\r\n      their own and settled down in town.\nNatásha’s illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for her\r\n      parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness, her conduct\r\n      and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the background. She\r\n      was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was\r\n      to blame for what had happened. She could not eat or sleep, grew visibly\r\n      thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them feel, was in danger. They\r\n      could not think of anything but how to help her. Doctors came to see her\r\n      singly and in consultation, talked much in French, German, and Latin,\r\n      blamed one another, and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all\r\n      the diseases known to them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of\r\n      them that they could not know the disease Natásha was suffering from, as\r\n      no disease suffered by a live man can be known, for every living person\r\n      has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal,\r\n      novel, complicated disease, unknown to medicine—not a disease of the\r\n      lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical books,\r\n      but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the\r\n      maladies of those organs. This simple thought could not occur to the\r\n      doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his\r\n      charms) because the business of their lives was to cure, and they received\r\n      money for it and had spent the best years of their lives on that business.\r\n      But, above all, that thought was kept out of their minds by the fact that\r\n      they saw they were really useful, as in fact they were to the whole Rostóv\r\n      family. Their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow\r\n      substances for the most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible,\r\n      as they were given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and\r\n      indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of\r\n      those who loved her—and that is why there are, and always will be,\r\n      pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied that\r\n      eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that something\r\n      should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They satisfied\r\n      the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it wants to\r\n      have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself and runs at\r\n      once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or\r\n      kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child cannot believe\r\n      that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain,\r\n      and the hope of relief and the expression of its mother’s sympathy while\r\n      she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were of use to Natásha because\r\n      they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it would soon pass if\r\n      only the coachman went to the chemist’s in the Arbát and got a powder and\r\n      some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks, and if she took\r\n      those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours, neither\r\n      more nor less.\nWhat would Sónya and the count and countess have done, how would they have\r\n      looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills to\r\n      give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the other\r\n      details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which supplied\r\n      an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How would the count\r\n      have borne his dearly loved daughter’s illness had he not known that it\r\n      was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not grudge thousands\r\n      more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her illness continued he\r\n      would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for\r\n      consultations there, and had he not been able to explain the details of\r\n      how Métivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms, but Frise had,\r\n      and Múdrov had diagnosed them even better? What would the countess have\r\n      done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly\r\n      obeying the doctor’s orders?\n“You’ll never get well like that,” she would say, forgetting her\r\n      grief in her vexation, “if you won’t obey the doctor and take your\r\n      medicine at the right time! You mustn’t trifle with it, you know, or it may\r\n      turn topneumonia,” she would go on, deriving much comfort from the\r\n      utterance of that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.\nWhat would Sónya have done without the glad consciousness that she had not\r\n      undressed during the first three nights, in order to be ready to carry out\r\n      all the doctor’s injunctions with precision, and that she still kept awake\r\n      at night so as not to miss the proper time when the slightly harmful pills\r\n      in the little gilt box had to be administered? Even to Natásha herself it\r\n      was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake,\r\n      and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours, though she\r\n      declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense. And\r\n      it was even pleasant to be able to show, by disregarding the orders, that\r\n      she did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life.\nThe doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and\r\n      regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he had gone\r\n      into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he\r\n      assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though\r\n      there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and one\r\n      must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but... And the\r\n      countess, trying to conceal the action from herself and from him, slipped\r\n      a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more\r\n      tranquil mind.\nThe symptoms of Natásha’s illness were that she ate little, slept little,\r\n      coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that she could not\r\n      get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the stifling\r\n      atmosphere of the town, and the Rostóvs did not move to the country that\r\n      summer of 1812.\nIn spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out of\r\n      the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of such\r\n      things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of the\r\n      country life to which she was accustomed, youth prevailed. Natásha’s grief\r\n      began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life, it ceased to press\r\n      so painfully on her heart, it gradually faded into the past, and she began\r\n      to recover physically."

    "text": "Natásha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external\r\n      forms of pleasure—balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters—but\r\n      she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not\r\n      sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears\r\n      choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure\r\n      times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so\r\n      uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy.\r\n      Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy, in face\r\n      of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to coquet ever\r\n      entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no man was more to\r\n      her than Nastásya Ivánovna, the buffoon. Something stood sentinel within\r\n      her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all the old interests\r\n      of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope. The previous\r\n      autumn, the hunting, “Uncle,” and the Christmas holidays spent with\r\n      Nicholas at Otrádnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully.\r\n      What would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that\r\n      time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at the time had not\r\n      deceived her—that that state of freedom and readiness for any\r\n      enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live on.\nIt comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly\r\n      imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But this\r\n      was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, “What next?” But there\r\n      was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was passing.\r\n      Natásha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone, but\r\n      wanted nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in the house and\r\n      felt at ease only with her brother Pétya. She liked to be with him better\r\n      than with the others, and when alone with him she sometimes laughed. She\r\n      hardly ever left the house and of those who came to see them was glad to\r\n      see only one person, Pierre. It would have been impossible to treat her\r\n      with more delicacy, greater care, and at the same time more seriously than\r\n      did Count Bezúkhov. Natásha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found\r\n      great pleasure in his society. But she was not even grateful to him for\r\n      it; nothing good on Pierre’s part seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed\r\n      so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his\r\n      kindness. Sometimes Natásha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his\r\n      part in her presence, especially when he wanted to do something to please\r\n      her, or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories\r\n      distressing to her. She noticed this and attributed it to his general\r\n      kindness and shyness, which she imagined must be the same toward everyone\r\n      as it was to her. After those involuntary words—that if he were free\r\n      he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love—uttered\r\n      at a moment when she was so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to\r\n      Natásha of his feelings; and it seemed plain to her that those words,\r\n      which had then so comforted her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless\r\n      words are spoken to comfort a crying child. It was not because Pierre was\r\n      a married man, but because Natásha felt very strongly with him that moral\r\n      barrier the absence of which she had experienced with Kurágin that it\r\n      never entered her head that the relations between him and herself could\r\n      lead to love on her part, still less on his, or even to the kind of\r\n      tender, self-conscious, romantic friendship between a man and a woman of\r\n      which she had known several instances.\nBefore the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agraféna Ivánovna Belóva, a\r\n      country neighbor of the Rostóvs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at\r\n      the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natásha should fast\r\n      and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natásha gladly welcomed the idea.\r\n      Despite the doctor’s orders that she should not go out early in the\r\n      morning, Natásha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament, not\r\n      as they generally prepared for it in the Rostóv family by attending three\r\n      services in their own house, but as Agraféna Ivánovna did, by going to\r\n      church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers, Matins, or Mass.\nThe countess was pleased with Natásha’s zeal; after the poor results of\r\n      the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer\r\n      might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without fear\r\n      and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to Natásha’s wish and\r\n      entrusted her to Belóva. Agraféna Ivánovna used to come to wake Natásha at\r\n      three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was\r\n      afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on\r\n      her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, Natásha, shivering in the fresh\r\n      air, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn. By\r\n      Agraféna Ivánovna’s advice Natásha prepared herself not in their own\r\n      parish, but at a church where, according to the devout Agraféna Ivánovna,\r\n      the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were never many\r\n      people in the church; Natásha always stood beside Belóva in the customary\r\n      place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the screen before the\r\n      choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of humility before\r\n      something great and incomprehensible, seized her when at that unusual\r\n      morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin illuminated by the\r\n      candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the\r\n      window, she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow\r\n      with understanding. When she understood them her personal feeling became\r\n      interwoven in the prayers with shades of its own. When she did not\r\n      understand, it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand\r\n      everything is pride, that it is impossible to understand all, that it is\r\n      only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to God, whom she felt\r\n      guiding her soul at those moments. She crossed herself, bowed low, and\r\n      when she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness, simply asked\r\n      God to forgive her everything, everything, to have mercy upon her. The\r\n      prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of\r\n      repentance. On her way home at an early hour when she met no one but\r\n      bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street, and everybody within\r\n      the houses was still asleep, Natásha experienced a feeling new to her, a\r\n      sense of the possibility of correcting her faults, the possibility of a\r\n      new, clean life, and of happiness.\nDuring the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every day.\r\n      And the happiness of taking communion, or “communing” as Agraféna\r\n      Ivánovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natásha so\r\n      great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.\nBut the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in\r\n      white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for\r\n      many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life\r\n      that lay before her.\nThe doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the\r\n      powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.\n“She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,” said he,\r\n      evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. “Only, please be\r\n      particular about it.\n“Be quite easy,” he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold coin\r\n      in his palm. “She will soon be singing and frolicking about. The last\r\n      medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has freshened up very\r\n      much.”\nThe countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her\r\n      nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER XVIII",
    "text": "At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war\r\n      began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to the\r\n      people, and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow. And as up to\r\n      the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received, exaggerated\r\n      reports became current about them and about the position of Russia. It was\r\n      said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger, it\r\n      was said that Smolénsk had surrendered, that Napoleon had an army of a\r\n      million and only a miracle could save Russia.\nOn the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received\r\n      but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Rostóvs’, promised to\r\n      come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto and\r\n      appeal, which he would obtain from Count Rostopchín.\nThat Sunday, the Rostóvs went to Mass at the Razumóvskis’ private chapel\r\n      as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o’clock, when the Rostóvs got\r\n      out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of\r\n      hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves\r\n      of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white\r\n      trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on the\r\n      cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that summer\r\n      languor, that content and discontent with the present, which is most\r\n      strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow notabilities,\r\n      all the Rostóvs’ acquaintances, were at the Razumóvskis’ chapel, for, as\r\n      if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families who usually left\r\n      town for their country estates had not gone away that summer. As Natásha,\r\n      at her mother’s side, passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman\r\n      who cleared the way for them, she heard a young man speaking about her in\r\n      too loud a whisper.\n“That’s Rostóva, the one who...”\n“She’s much thinner, but all the same she’s pretty!”\nShe heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kurágin and Bolkónski. But\r\n      she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that everyone who\r\n      looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her. With a\r\n      sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a\r\n      crowd, Natásha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked—as\r\n      women can walk—with the more repose and stateliness the greater the\r\n      pain and shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she was pretty, but\r\n      this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to. On the contrary it\r\n      tormented her more than anything else of late, and particularly so on this\r\n      bright, hot summer day in town. “It’s Sunday again—another week\r\n      past,” she thought, recalling that she had been here the Sunday before,\r\n      “and always the same life that is no life, and the same surroundings in\r\n      which it used to be so easy to live. I’m pretty, I’m young, and I know\r\n      that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I know I am good,” she\r\n      thought, “but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to\r\n      anyone.” She stood by her mother’s side and exchanged nods with\r\n      acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies’ dresses,\r\n      condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing\r\n      herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought with\r\n      vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others, and\r\n      suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own\r\n      vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to\r\n      her.\nA comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that mild\r\n      solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of\r\n      the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed, the curtain\r\n      was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced\r\n      some words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not understand, made\r\n      Natásha’s breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her.\n“Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good\r\n      forever, forever!” she pleaded.\nThe deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and,\r\n      holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic\r\n      and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and\r\n      solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer....\n“In peace let us pray unto the Lord.”\n“As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united by\r\n      brotherly love—let us pray!” thought Natásha.\n“For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls.”\n“For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,” prayed\r\n      Natásha.\nWhen they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and Denísov.\r\n      When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she remembered Prince\r\n      Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her all the wrongs she\r\n      had done him. When they prayed for those who love us, she prayed for the\r\n      members of her own family, her father and mother and Sónya, realizing for\r\n      the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them, and feeling all the\r\n      strength of her love for them. When they prayed for those who hate us, she\r\n      tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her, in order to pray\r\n      for them. She included among her enemies the creditors and all who had\r\n      business dealings with her father, and always at the thought of enemies\r\n      and those who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done her so much\r\n      harm—and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as for\r\n      an enemy. Only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and calmly of\r\n      Prince Andrew and Anatole, as men for whom her feelings were as nothing\r\n      compared with her awe and devotion to God. When they prayed for the\r\n      Imperial family and the Synod, she bowed very low and made the sign of the\r\n      cross, saying to herself that even if she did not understand, still she\r\n      could not doubt, and at any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for\r\n      it.\nWhen he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his\r\n      breast and said, “Let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ\r\n      the Lord!”\n“Commit ourselves to God,” Natásha inwardly repeated. “Lord God, I submit\r\n      myself to Thy will!” she thought. “I want nothing, wish for nothing; teach\r\n      me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take me!” prayed Natásha,\r\n      with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing herself but letting her\r\n      slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at any moment\r\n      to take her and deliver her from herself, from her regrets, desires,\r\n      remorse, hopes, and sins.\nThe countess looked round several times at her daughter’s softened face\r\n      and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.\nUnexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order\r\n      Natásha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he\r\n      knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors of\r\n      the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his purple velvet biretta\r\n      on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort. Everybody\r\n      followed his example and they looked at one another in surprise. Then came\r\n      the prayer just received from the Synod—a prayer for the deliverance\r\n      of Russia from hostile invasion.\n“Lord God of might, God of our salvation!” began the priest in that voice,\r\n      clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav clergy read and\r\n      which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.\n“Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and\r\n      blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and have\r\n      mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay waste the\r\n      whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are gathered together to\r\n      overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy beloved Russia;\r\n      to defile Thy temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to desecrate our\r\n      holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked triumph? How\r\n      long shall they wield unlawful power?\n“Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might our\r\n      most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander Pávlovich; be mindful\r\n      of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to his\r\n      righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless his\r\n      counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by Thine\r\n      almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou gavest\r\n      Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over Goliath.\r\n      Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who have armed\r\n      themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength for the fight.\r\n      Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us; confound and put to\r\n      shame those who have devised evil against us, may they be before the faces\r\n      of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind, and may Thy mighty Angel\r\n      confound them and put them to flight; may they be ensnared when they know\r\n      it not, and may the plots they have laid in secret be turned against them;\r\n      let them fall before Thy servants’ feet and be laid low by our hosts!\r\n      Lord, Thou art able to save both great and small; Thou art God, and man\r\n      cannot prevail against Thee!\n“God of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness\r\n      which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us, but be gracious to our\r\n      unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not\r\n      our transgressions and iniquities! Create in us a clean heart and renew a\r\n      right spirit within us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our hope,\r\n      inspire us with true love one for another, arm us with unity of spirit in\r\n      the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and to our\r\n      fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the\r\n      destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.\n“O Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust, let us\r\n      not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token of Thy\r\n      blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and be\r\n      put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that Thou art the\r\n      Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord, and\r\n      grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice in Thy\r\n      mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of\r\n      Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor, and the\r\n      victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all glory, to\r\n      Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without end. Amen.”\nIn Natásha’s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her\r\n      strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over\r\n      Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about the\r\n      destruction of “Thy Jerusalem,” and she prayed to God with the tenderness\r\n      and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but without fully\r\n      understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer. She shared with\r\n      all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness, for the\r\n      strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation by love.\r\n      But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when\r\n      but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that\r\n      she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt the righteousness of\r\n      the prayer that was being read on bended knees. She felt in her heart a\r\n      devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes\r\n      men for their sins, and especially of her own sins, and she prayed to God\r\n      to forgive them all, and her too, and to give them all, and her too, peace\r\n      and happiness. And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer."

    "text": "From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostóvs’ with Natásha’s\r\n      grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to be\r\n      fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own\r\n      horizon—from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of\r\n      all earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer\r\n      presented itself. That terrible question “Why?” “Wherefore?” which had\r\n      come to him amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another\r\n      question or by a reply to the former question, but byherimage. When he\r\n      listened to, or himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read\r\n      or heard of human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and\r\n      did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so\r\n      transient and incomprehensible—but he remembered her as he had last\r\n      seen her, and all his doubts vanished—not because she had answered\r\n      the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her\r\n      transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual\r\n      activity in which no one could be justified or guilty—a realm of\r\n      beauty and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness\r\n      presented itself to him, he said to himself:\n“Well, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the\r\n      country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She\r\n      smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and no\r\n      one will ever know it.” And his soul felt calm and peaceful.\nPierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle and\r\n      dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the Rostóvs’ there\r\n      were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and acquaintances\r\n      he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along irresistibly.\r\n      But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of\r\n      war and Natásha’s health began to improve and she no longer aroused in him\r\n      the former feeling of careful pity, an ever-increasing restlessness, which\r\n      he could not explain, took possession of him. He felt that the condition\r\n      he was in could not continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which\r\n      would change his whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for\r\n      signs of that approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had\r\n      revealed to Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from\r\n      the Revelation of St. John.\nIn chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the\r\n      beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred\r\n      threescore and six.\nAnd in the fifth verse of the same chapter:\nAnd there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and\r\n      blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two\r\n      months.\n\nThe French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the\r\n      Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens,\r\n      will have the following significance:\nWriting the wordsL’Empereur Napoléonin numbers, it appears that the\r\n      sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold in the\r\n      Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the wordsquarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that “spoke\r\n      great things and blasphemies,” the same number 666 was obtained; from which it\r\n      followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon’s power had come in the year\r\n      1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy pleased Pierre\r\n      very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of\r\n      the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the same system of using\r\n      letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an answer to the question\r\n      that engrossed him. He wrote the wordsL’Empereur Alexandre, La nation\r\n      russeand added up their numbers, but the sums were either more or less\r\n      than 666. Once when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in\r\n      French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the sum of the numbers did not come\r\n      right. Then he changed the spelling, substituting azfor thesand\r\n      addingdeand the articlele, still without obtaining the desired\r\n      result. Then it occurred to him: if the answer to the question were contained in\r\n      his name, his nationality would also be given in the answer. So he wroteLe\r\n      russe Besuhofand adding up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much,\r\n      and five was represented bye, the very letter elided from the articlelebefore the wordEmpereur. By omitting thee, though\r\n      incorrectly, Pierre got the answer he sought.L’russe Besuhofmade\r\n      666. This discovery excited him. How, or by what means, he was connected with the\r\n      great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that\r\n      connection for a moment. His love for Natásha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion,\r\n      the comet, 666,L’Empereur Napoléon, andL’russe\r\n      Besuhof—all this had to mature and culminate, to lift him out of that\r\n      spellbound, petty sphere of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and\r\n      lead him to a great achievement and great happiness.\n* Forty-two.\n\nOn the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had\r\n      promised the Rostóvs to bring them, from Count Rostopchín whom he knew\r\n      well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the\r\n      morning, when he went to call at Rostopchín’s he met there a courier fresh\r\n      from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at Moscow\r\n      balls.\n“Do, please, for heaven’s sake, relieve me of something!” said the\r\n      courier. “I have a sackful of letters to parents.”\nAmong these letters was one from Nicholas Rostóv to his father. Pierre\r\n      took that letter, and Rostopchín also gave him the Emperor’s appeal to\r\n      Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own\r\n      most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in\r\n      one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of\r\n      Nicholas Rostóv, awarded a St. George’s Cross of the Fourth Class for\r\n      courage shown in the Ostróvna affair, and in the same order the name of\r\n      Prince Andrew Bolkónski, appointed to the command of a regiment of\r\n      Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind the Rostóvs of Bolkónski,\r\n      Pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their son’s\r\n      having received a decoration, so he sent that printed army order and\r\n      Nicholas’ letter to the Rostóvs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the\r\n      other orders to take with him when he went to dinner.\nHis conversation with Count Rostopchín and the latter’s tone of anxious\r\n      hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly\r\n      things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in\r\n      Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised to\r\n      be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the\r\n      Emperor’s being expected to arrive next day—all aroused with fresh\r\n      force that feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had\r\n      been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially\r\n      since the beginning of the war.\nHe had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so had\r\n      he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of\r\n      Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual\r\n      peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he saw\r\n      the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking\r\n      patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief reason\r\n      for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea\r\n      that he wasL’russe Besuhofwho had the number of the beast, 666; that\r\n      his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that\r\n      spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity, and\r\n      that therefore he ought not to undertake anything, but wait for what was\r\n      bound to come to pass."

    "text": "A few intimate friends were dining with the Rostóvs that day, as usual on\r\n      Sundays.\nPierre came early so as to find them alone.\nHe had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he\r\n      not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his bulk\r\n      with evident ease.\nHe went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman did\r\n      not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was at\r\n      the Rostóvs’ he stayed till midnight. The Rostóvs’ footman rushed eagerly\r\n      forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick. Pierre,\r\n      from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the anteroom.\nThe first person he saw in the house was Natásha. Even before he saw her,\r\n      while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa\r\n      exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her\r\n      illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He\r\n      opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at\r\n      church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he\r\n      opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised\r\n      face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.\n“I want to try to sing again,” she said, adding as if by way of excuse,\r\n      “it is, at least, something to do.”\n“That’s capital!”\n“How glad I am you’ve come! I am so happy today,” she said, with the old\r\n      animation Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. “You know Nicholas\r\n      has received a St. George’s Cross? I am so proud of him.”\n“Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don’t want to interrupt you,” he\r\n      added, and was about to go to the drawing room.\nNatásha stopped him.\n“Count, is it wrong of me to sing?” she said blushing, and fixing her eyes\r\n      inquiringly on him.\n“No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?”\n“I don’t know myself,” Natásha answered quickly, “but I should not like to\r\n      do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You don’t\r\n      know how important you are to me, how much you’ve done for me....” She\r\n      spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. “I saw\r\n      in that same army order thathe, Bolkónski” (she whispered the name\r\n      hastily), “is in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?”—she\r\n      was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail her—“Will\r\n      he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me?\r\n      What do you think? What do you think?”\n“I think...” Pierre replied, “that he has nothing to forgive.... If I were\r\n      in his place...”\nBy association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day when,\r\n      trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but the\r\n      best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her hand;\r\n      and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession of him\r\n      and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him time to say\r\n      them.\n“Yes, you... you...” she said, uttering the wordyourapturously—“that’s a different thing. I know no one kinder, more\r\n      generous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now\r\n      too, I don’t know what would have become of me, because...”\nTears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music before\r\n      her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and down the\r\n      room.\nJust then Pétya came running in from the drawing room.\nPétya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and\r\n      resembled Natásha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and\r\n      his friend Obolénski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.\nPétya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair. He\r\n      had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars.\nPierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what Pétya\r\n      was saying.\nPétya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.\n“Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirílych, for heaven’s sake! You are my\r\n      only hope,” said Pétya.\n“Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I’ll mention it, I’ll bring it\r\n      all up today.”\n“Well,mon cher, have you got the manifesto?” asked the old count. “The\r\n      countess has been to Mass at the Razumóvskis’ and heard the new prayer.\r\n      She says it’s very fine.”\n“Yes, I’ve got it,” said Pierre. “The Emperor is to be here tomorrow...\r\n      there’s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are\r\n      talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate\r\n      you!”\n“Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?”\n“We are again retreating. They say we’re already near Smolénsk,” replied\r\n      Pierre.\n“O Lord, O Lord!” exclaimed the count. “Where is the manifesto?”\n“The Emperor’s appeal? Oh yes!”\nPierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find\r\n      them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess who\r\n      entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting Natásha,\r\n      who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room.\n“On my word, I don’t know what I’ve done with it,” he said.\n“There he is, always losing everything!” remarked the countess.\nNatásha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat\r\n      down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierre’s\r\n      features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still\r\n      searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.\n“No, really! I’ll drive home, I must have left them there. I’ll\r\n      certainly...”\n“But you’ll be late for dinner.”\n“Oh! And my coachman has gone.”\nBut Sónya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had found\r\n      them in Pierre’s hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the lining.\r\n      Pierre was about to begin reading.\n“No, after dinner,” said the old count, evidently expecting much enjoyment\r\n      from that reading.\nAt dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new chevalier\r\n      of St. George, Shinshín told them the town news, of the illness of the old\r\n      Georgian princess, of Métivier’s disappearance from Moscow, and of how\r\n      some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchín and accused of being a\r\n      French “spyer” (so Count Rostopchín had told the story), and how\r\n      Rostopchín let him go and assured the people that he was “not a spire at\r\n      all, but only an old German ruin.”\n“People are being arrested...” said the count. “I’ve told the countess she\r\n      should not speak French so much. It’s not the time for it now.”\n“And have you heard?” Shinshín asked. “Prince Golítsyn has engaged a\r\n      master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in\r\n      the streets.”\n“And how about you, Count Peter Kirílych? If they call up the militia, you\r\n      too will have to mount a horse,” remarked the old count, addressing\r\n      Pierre.\nPierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not to\r\n      grasp what was said. He looked at the count.\n“Oh yes, the war,” he said. “No! What sort of warrior should I make? And\r\n      yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can’t make it out. I don’t\r\n      know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no one\r\n      can answer for himself.”\nAfter dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and\r\n      with a serious face asked Sónya, who was considered an excellent reader,\r\n      to read the appeal.\n“To Moscow, our ancient Capital!\n“The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He comes\r\n      to despoil our beloved country.”\nSónya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened\r\n      with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.\nNatásha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and now\r\n      at Pierre.\nPierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess\r\n      shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in\r\n      the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger threatening\r\n      her son would not soon be over. Shinshín, with a sarcastic smile on his\r\n      lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the\r\n      opportunity: Sónya’s reading, any remark of the count’s, or even the\r\n      manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.\nAfter reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes the\r\n      Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility,\r\n      Sónya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was\r\n      being paid to her, read the last words:\n“We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital\r\n      and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the direction of\r\n      all our levies, both those now barring the enemy’s path and those freshly\r\n      formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the ruin he hopes to\r\n      bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered from\r\n      bondage glorify the name of Russia!”\n\n“Yes, that’s it!” cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing\r\n      repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he\r\n      added, “Let the Emperor but say the word and we’ll sacrifice everything\r\n      and begrudge nothing.”\nBefore Shinshín had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the\r\n      count’s patriotism, Natásha jumped up from her place and ran to her\r\n      father.\n“What a darling our Papa is!” she cried, kissing him, and she again looked\r\n      at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her\r\n      better spirits.\n“There! Here’s a patriot for you!” said Shinshín.\n“Not a patriot at all, but simply...” Natásha replied in an injured tone.\r\n      “Everything seems funny to you, but this isn’t at all a joke....”\n“A joke indeed!” put in the count. “Let him but say the word and we’ll all\r\n      go.... We’re not Germans!”\n“But did you notice, it says, ‘for consultation’?” said Pierre.\n“Never mind what it’s for....”\nAt this moment, Pétya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up to\r\n      his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice that\r\n      was now deep and now shrill:\n“Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it’s as you please, but\r\n      I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I can’t...\r\n      that’s all....”\nThe countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and\r\n      turned angrily to her husband.\n“That comes of your talking!” said she.\nBut the count had already recovered from his excitement.\n“Come, come!” said he. “Here’s a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must\r\n      study.”\n“It’s not nonsense, Papa. Fédya Obolénski is younger than I, and he’s\r\n      going too. Besides, all the same I can’t study now when...” Pétya stopped\r\n      short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words, “when our\r\n      Fatherland is in danger.”\n“That’ll do, that’ll do—nonsense....”\n“But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.”\n“Pétya! Be quiet, I tell you!” cried the count, with a glance at his wife,\r\n      who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.\n“And I tell you—Peter Kirílych here will also tell you...”\n“Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother’s milk has hardly dried on your lips\r\n      and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,” and the count\r\n      moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread them in\r\n      his study before having a nap.\n“Well, Peter Kirílych, let’s go and have a smoke,” he said.\nPierre was agitated and undecided. Natásha’s unwontedly brilliant eyes,\r\n      continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced him\r\n      to this condition.\n“No, I think I’ll go home.”\n“Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don’t often\r\n      come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,” said the count\r\n      good-naturedly, pointing to Natásha, “only brightens up when you’re here.”\n“Yes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...” said Pierre\r\n      hurriedly.\n“Well, then,au revoir!” said the count, and went out of the room.\n“Why are you going? Why are you upset?” asked Natásha, and she looked\r\n      challengingly into Pierre’s eyes.\n“Because I love you!” was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it,\r\n      and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.\n“Because it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply I\r\n      have business....”\n“Why? No, tell me!” Natásha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.\nThey looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried to\r\n      smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently kissed\r\n      her hand and went out.\nPierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostóvs’ any more."

    "text": "After the definite refusal he had received, Pétya went to his room and\r\n      there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea, silent,\r\n      morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to notice\r\n      anything.\nNext day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rostóvs’\r\n      domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That morning\r\n      Pétya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar to look\r\n      like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass, gesticulated,\r\n      shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word to anyone, took\r\n      his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to avoid notice. Pétya\r\n      decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and to explain frankly to\r\n      some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor to be always surrounded\r\n      by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostóv, in spite of his youth\r\n      wished to serve his country; that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty,\r\n      and that he was ready to... While dressing, Pétya had prepared many fine\r\n      things he meant to say to the gentleman-in-waiting.\nIt was on the very fact of being so young that Pétya counted for success\r\n      in reaching the Emperor—he even thought how surprised everyone would\r\n      be at his youthfulness—and yet in the arrangement of his collar and\r\n      hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man.\r\n      But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the\r\n      ever-increasing crowds moving toward the Krémlin, the less he remembered\r\n      to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached\r\n      the Krémlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out\r\n      his elbows in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he was so\r\n      pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic\r\n      intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination\r\n      he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in, rumbling beneath\r\n      the archway. Beside Pétya stood a peasant woman, a footman, two tradesmen,\r\n      and a discharged soldier. After standing some time in the gateway, Pétya\r\n      tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the\r\n      carriages to pass, and he began resolutely working his way with his\r\n      elbows, but the woman just in front of him, who was the first against whom\r\n      he directed his efforts, angrily shouted at him:\n“What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don’t you see we’re all\r\n      standing still? Then why push?”\n“Anybody can shove,” said the footman, and also began working his elbows\r\n      to such effect that he pushed Pétya into a very filthy corner of the\r\n      gateway.\nPétya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp\r\n      collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man’s.\nHe felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were\r\n      now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be\r\n      admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up or\r\n      move to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who drove\r\n      past was an acquaintance of the Rostóvs’, and Pétya thought of asking his\r\n      help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to\r\n      do. When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd, carrying Pétya with\r\n      it, streamed forward into the Krémlin Square which was already full of\r\n      people. There were people not only in the square, but everywhere—on\r\n      the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as Pétya found himself in the square\r\n      he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd\r\n      that filled the whole Krémlin.\nFor a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared,\r\n      and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Pétya was being pressed so\r\n      that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, “Hurrah! hurrah!\r\n      hurrah!” Pétya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see\r\n      nothing except the people about him.\nAll the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A\r\n      tradesman’s wife standing beside Pétya sobbed, and the tears ran down her\r\n      cheeks.\n“Father! Angel! Dear one!” she kept repeating, wiping away her tears with\r\n      her fingers.\n“Hurrah!” was heard on all sides.\nFor a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush forward.\nQuite beside himself, Pétya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes\r\n      ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting “hurrah!” as if\r\n      he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but on\r\n      both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed\r\n      forward and everybody shouted “hurrah!”\n“So this is what the Emperor is!” thought Pétya. “No, I can’t petition him\r\n      myself—that would be too bold.” But in spite of this he continued to\r\n      struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those in front\r\n      he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out\r\n      on it; but just then the crowd swayed back—the police in front were\r\n      pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession: the\r\n      Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption—and\r\n      Pétya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was\r\n      squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he\r\n      lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a man of clerical appearance\r\n      with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue\r\n      cassock—probably a church clerk and chanter—was holding him\r\n      under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd\r\n      with the other.\n“You’ve crushed the young gentleman!” said the clerk. “What are you up to?\r\n      Gently!... They’ve crushed him, crushed him!”\nThe Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread out\r\n      again more evenly, and the clerk led Pétya—pale and breathless—to\r\n      the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for Pétya, and suddenly a crowd\r\n      turned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest him\r\n      attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised platform of\r\n      the cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might be) who had\r\n      crushed him.\n“One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing\r\n      people! Poor dear, he’s as white as a sheet!”—various voices were\r\n      heard saying.\nPétya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had\r\n      passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a\r\n      place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who would be\r\n      returning that way. Pétya no longer thought of presenting his petition. If\r\n      he could only see the Emperor he would be happy!\nWhile the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption—it\r\n      was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor’s arrival\r\n      and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the Turks—the\r\n      crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling kvass, gingerbread,\r\n      and poppyseed sweets (of which Pétya was particularly fond), and ordinary\r\n      conversation could again be heard. A tradesman’s wife was showing a rent\r\n      in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost; another was saying\r\n      that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk who had rescued Pétya was\r\n      talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day\r\n      with the bishop. The clerk several times used the word “plenary” (of the\r\n      service), a word Pétya did not understand. Two young citizens were joking\r\n      with some serf girls who were cracking nuts. All these conversations,\r\n      especially the joking with the girls, were such as might have had a\r\n      particular charm for Pétya at his age, but they did not interest him now.\r\n      He sat on his elevation—the pedestal of the cannon—still\r\n      agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by his love for him.\r\n      The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed,\r\n      together with that of rapture, still further intensified his sense of the\r\n      importance of the occasion.\nSuddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment, to\r\n      celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed\r\n      impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing. Pétya too would\r\n      have run there, but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his\r\n      protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding when officers,\r\n      generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the cathedral, and\r\n      after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were again raised, and\r\n      those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again. At last four men\r\n      in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors. “Hurrah! hurrah!”\r\n       shouted the crowd again.\n“Which is he? Which?” asked Pétya in a tearful voice, of those around him,\r\n      but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and Pétya, fixing on\r\n      one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy\r\n      that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm on him—though\r\n      it happened not to be the Emperor—frantically shouted “Hurrah!” and\r\n      resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the army.\nThe crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began to\r\n      disperse. It was already late, and Pétya had not eaten anything and was\r\n      drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with that\r\n      diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while the\r\n      Emperor dined—looking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew\r\n      not what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance\r\n      to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table,\r\n      glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows.\nWhile the Emperor was dining, Valúev, looking out of the window, said:\n“The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.”\nThe dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose and\r\n      went out onto the balcony. The people, with Pétya among them, rushed\r\n      toward the balcony.\n“Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...” cried the crowd, and Pétya with it,\r\n      and again the women and men of weaker mold, Pétya among them, wept with\r\n      joy.\nA largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke\r\n      off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A coachman in a\r\n      jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several\r\n      people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had a\r\n      plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the\r\n      balcony. Pétya’s eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the danger\r\n      of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why, but he\r\n      had to have a biscuit from the Tsar’s hand and he felt that he must not\r\n      give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a\r\n      biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was\r\n      lying on the ground—she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did\r\n      not reach them. Pétya pushed her hand away with his knee, seized a\r\n      biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted “Hurrah!” with a\r\n      voice already hoarse.\nThe Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began to\r\n      disperse.\n“There! I said if only we waited—and so it was!” was being joyfully\r\n      said by various people.\nHappy as Pétya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the\r\n      enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from the\r\n      Krémlin, but called on his friend Obolénski, who was fifteen and was also\r\n      entering the regiment. On returning home Pétya announced resolutely and\r\n      firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away.\r\n      And next day, Count Ilyá Rostóv—though he had not yet quite yielded—went\r\n      to inquire how he could arrange for Pétya to serve where there would be\r\n      least danger."

    "text": "Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages\r\n      were standing outside the Slobóda Palace.\nThe great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in\r\n      their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats of\r\n      blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen’s hall there was an\r\n      incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on\r\n      high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor, but\r\n      most of the gentry were strolling about the room.\nAll these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own\r\n      houses, were in uniform—some in that of Catherine’s day, others in\r\n      that of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexander’s time\r\n      or the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic of\r\n      being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse\r\n      and familiar personalities, both old and young. The old men, dim-eyed,\r\n      toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, were\r\n      especially striking. For the most part they sat quietly in their places\r\n      and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached themselves\r\n      to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd Pétya\r\n      had seen in the Square, there was a striking contradiction: the general\r\n      expectation of a solemn event, and at the same time the everyday interests\r\n      in a boston card party, Peter the cook, Zinaída Dmítrievna’s health, and\r\n      so on.\nPierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman’s\r\n      uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated; this\r\n      extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant-class—les\r\n      états généraux(States-General)—evoked in him a whole series of\r\n      ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul:\r\n      thoughts of theContrat Socialand the French Revolution. The words that\r\n      had struck him in the Emperor’s appeal—that the sovereign was coming\r\n      to the capital for consultation with his people—strengthened this\r\n      idea. And imagining that in this direction something important which he\r\n      had long awaited was drawing near, he strolled about watching and\r\n      listening to conversations, but nowhere finding any confirmation of the\r\n      ideas that occupied him.\nThe Emperor’s manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved\r\n      about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre\r\n      heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when\r\n      the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperor’s honor,\r\n      whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces...\r\n      and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or what the nobility had\r\n      been convened for, the talk became undecided and indefinite. Then all\r\n      preferred listening to speaking.\nA middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired naval\r\n      officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was pressing\r\n      round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker\r\n      and listened. Count Ilyá Rostóv, in a military uniform of Catherine’s\r\n      time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd, with all of\r\n      whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and listened with a\r\n      kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did, to what the speaker\r\n      was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very boldly, as was evident\r\n      from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that\r\n      some people Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away\r\n      disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him. Pierre pushed his way\r\n      into the middle of the group, listened, and convinced himself that the man\r\n      was indeed a liberal, but of views quite different from his own. The naval\r\n      officer spoke in a particularly sonorous, musical, and aristocratic\r\n      baritone voice, pleasantly swallowing hisr’s and generally slurring his\r\n      consonants: the voice of a man calling out to his servant, “Heah! Bwing me\r\n      my pipe!” It was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority.\n“What if the Smolénsk people have offahd to waise militia for the Empewah?\r\n      Ah we to take Smolénsk as our patte’n? If the noble awistocwacy of the\r\n      pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our sov’weign\r\n      the Empewah in other ways. Have we fo’gotten the waising of the militia in\r\n      the yeah ‘seven? All that did was to enwich the pwiests’ sons and thieves\r\n      and wobbahs....”\nCount Ilyá Rostóv smiled blandly and nodded approval.\n“And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined\r\n      our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o’ ou’ men will wetu’n\r\n      neithah soldiers no’ peasants, and we’ll get only depwavity fwom them. The\r\n      nobility don’t gwudge theah lives—evewy one of us will go and bwing\r\n      in more wecwuits, and the sov’weign” (that was the way he referred to the\r\n      Emperor) “need only say the word and we’ll all die fo’ him!” added the\r\n      orator with animation.\nCount Rostóv’s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but\r\n      Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred, but\r\n      not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he opened\r\n      his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his head,\r\n      with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first speaker,\r\n      interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and to\r\n      maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:\n“I imagine, sir,” said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, “that we\r\n      have been summoned here not to discuss whether it’s best for the empire at\r\n      the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia. We\r\n      have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the\r\n      Emperor has honored us. But to judge what is best—conscription or\r\n      the militia—we can leave to the supreme authority....”\nPierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart\r\n      against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into\r\n      the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and interrupted\r\n      him. He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he began to speak\r\n      eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing himself in bookish\r\n      Russian.\n“Excuse me, your excellency,” he began. (He was well acquainted with the\r\n      senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him\r\n      formally.) “Though I don’t agree with the gentleman...” (he hesitated: he\r\n      wished to say,“Mon très honorable préopinant”—“My very honorable\r\n      opponent”) “with the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing, I\r\n      suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their\r\n      sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can\r\n      assist our Fatherland! I imagine,” he went on, warming to his subject,\r\n      “that the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely\r\n      owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, andchair à\r\n      canon* we are ready to make of ourselves—and not to obtain from us\r\n      any co-co-counsel.”\n* “Food for cannon.”\nMany persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator’s sarcastic\r\n      smile and the freedom of Pierre’s remarks. Only Count Rostóv was pleased\r\n      with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the\r\n      senator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.\n“I think that before discussing these questions,” Pierre continued, “we\r\n      should ask the Emperor—most respectfully ask His Majesty—to\r\n      let us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army\r\n      and our forces now are, and then...”\nBut scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from\r\n      three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance, a\r\n      boston player who had always been well disposed toward him, Stepán\r\n      Stepánovich Adráksin. Adráksin was in uniform, and whether as a result of\r\n      the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a\r\n      different man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face,\r\n      Adráksin shouted at Pierre:\n“In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor\r\n      about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the\r\n      Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are moved according to\r\n      the enemy’s movements and the number of men increases and decreases....”\nAnother voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years\r\n      of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies’ and knew as a bad\r\n      cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre,\r\n      interrupted Adráksin.\n“Yes, and this is not a time for discussing,” he continued, “but for\r\n      acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy Russia,\r\n      to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives and\r\n      children.” The nobleman smote his breast. “We will all arise, everyone of\r\n      us will go, for our father the Tsar!” he shouted, rolling his bloodshot\r\n      eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd. “We are Russians\r\n      and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith, the throne, and the\r\n      Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of our Fatherland! We will\r\n      show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of Russia!”\nPierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his\r\n      words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the\r\n      sound of his opponent’s voice.\nCount Rostóv at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several\r\n      persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase,\r\n      said:\n“That’s right, quite right! Just so!”\nPierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his serfs,\r\n      or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be\r\n      able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices shouted and\r\n      talked at the same time, so that Count Rostóv had not time to signify his\r\n      approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed, re-formed, and\r\n      then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table.\r\n      Not only was Pierre’s attempt to speak unsuccessful, but he was rudely\r\n      interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away from him as from a\r\n      common enemy. This happened not because they were displeased by the\r\n      substance of his speech, which had even been forgotten after the many\r\n      subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object\r\n      to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the latter. Many\r\n      other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in the same tone.\r\n      Many spoke eloquently and with originality.\nGlínka, the editor of theRussian Messenger, who was recognized (cries of\r\n      “author! author!” were heard in the crowd), said that “hell must be\r\n      repulsed by hell,” and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning\r\n      flashes and thunderclaps, but “we will not be that child.”\n“Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!” was repeated approvingly in the back rows of\r\n      the crowd.\nThe crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald\r\n      seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed, almost all of whom\r\n      Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing boston\r\n      at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the\r\n      table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs, the\r\n      orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together. Those standing\r\n      behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it.\r\n      Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and\r\n      hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre knew, sat and turned\r\n      to look first at one and then at another, and their faces for the most\r\n      part only expressed the fact that they found it very hot. Pierre, however,\r\n      felt excited, and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to\r\n      all lengths—which found expression in the tones and looks more than\r\n      in the substance of the speeches—infected him too. He did not\r\n      renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to\r\n      justify himself.\n“I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when\r\n      we know what is needed!” said he, trying to be heard above the other\r\n      voices.\nOne of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was\r\n      immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.\n“Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!” shouted one\r\n      man.\n“He is the enemy of mankind!” cried another. “Allow me to speak....”\r\n       “Gentlemen, you are crushing me!...”"

    "text": "At that moment Count Rostopchín with his protruding chin and alert eyes,\r\n      wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered the\r\n      room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.\n“Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,” said Rostopchín. “I\r\n      am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think there\r\n      is little need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon us and\r\n      the merchants. Millions will pour forth from there”—he pointed to\r\n      the merchants’ hall—“but our business is to supply men and not spare\r\n      ourselves.... That is the least we can do!”\nA conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table. The\r\n      whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding noise\r\n      the sound of their old voices saying one after another, “I agree,” or for\r\n      variety, “I too am of that opinion,” and so on had even a mournful effect.\nThe secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow nobility\r\n      and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped, out of every\r\n      thousand serfs, as the Smolénsk gentry had done. Their chairs made a\r\n      scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent\r\n      relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to stretch their legs\r\n      and converse in couples.\n“The Emperor! The Emperor!” a sudden cry resounded through the halls and\r\n      the whole throng hurried to the entrance.\nThe Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of\r\n      nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre\r\n      stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From\r\n      what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger\r\n      threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow nobility.\r\n      He was answered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just\r\n      arrived at.\n“Gentlemen!” said the Emperor with a quivering voice.\nThere was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that Pierre\r\n      distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying with\r\n      emotion:\n“I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has\r\n      surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland!\r\n      Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious....”\nThe Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and\r\n      rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.\n“Yes, most precious... a royal word,” said Count Rostóv, with a sob. He\r\n      stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood\r\n      everything in his own way.\nFrom the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants.\r\n      There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him\r\n      come out from the merchants’ hall with tears of emotion in his eyes. As\r\n      became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before\r\n      tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice. When\r\n      Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants, one\r\n      of whom Pierre knew, a fatotkupshchík. The other was the mayor, a man\r\n      with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were weeping. Tears filled\r\n      the thin man’s eyes, and the fatotkupshchíksobbed outright like a\r\n      child and kept repeating:\n“Our lives and property—take them, Your Majesty!”\nPierre’s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready\r\n      to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now felt\r\n      ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an\r\n      opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count Mamónov was furnishing\r\n      a regiment, Bezúkhov at once informed Rostopchín that he would give a\r\n      thousand men and their maintenance.\nOld Rostóv could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and\r\n      at once consented to Pétya’s request and went himself to enter his name.\nNext day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took off their\r\n      uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs, and not without\r\n      some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment, feeling\r\n      amazed themselves at what they had done."

    "text": "Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going to\r\n      Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he received,\r\n      could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating\r\n      influence of a June morning, and could not refrain from bursts of anger in\r\n      the presence of Kurákin and then of Balashëv.\nAlexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally\r\n      insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best way,\r\n      because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander.\r\n      Rostóv charged the French because he could not restrain his wish for a\r\n      gallop across a level field; and in the same way the innumerable people\r\n      who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal\r\n      characteristics, habits, circumstances, and aims. They were moved by fear\r\n      or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining that they knew\r\n      what they were doing and did it of their own free will, but they all were\r\n      involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work concealed from them but\r\n      comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable fate of men of action, and\r\n      the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free.\nThe actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal\r\n      interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that time\r\n      but its historic results.\nProvidence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to\r\n      further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all\r\n      expected—neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of\r\n      those who did the actual fighting.\nThe cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us\r\n      now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance\r\n      into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for a\r\n      winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war by the\r\n      burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the\r\n      Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems so evident)\r\n      that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men—the\r\n      best in the world and led by the best general—could be destroyed in\r\n      conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by\r\n      inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was.Not only did no one see\r\n      this, buton the Russian sideevery effort was made to hinder the only\r\n      thing that could save Russia, whileon the French side, despite Napoleon’s\r\n      experience and so-called military genius, every effort was directed to\r\n      pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to doing the very\r\n      thing that was bound to lead to destruction.\nIn historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of\r\n      saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he sought\r\n      a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolénsk, and of\r\n      making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even\r\n      then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from\r\n      the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was adopted to lure\r\n      Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some of them attribute\r\n      to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to Toll, and others again\r\n      to Alexander himself—pointing to notes, projects, and letters which\r\n      contain hints of such a line of action. But all these hints at what\r\n      happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are advanced only\r\n      because they fit in with the event. Had that event not occurred these\r\n      hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the thousands and\r\n      millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then\r\n      but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them. There are\r\n      always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it\r\n      may end there will always be people to say: “I said then that it would be\r\n      so,” quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to\r\n      quite the contrary effect.\nConjectures as to Napoleon’s awareness of the danger of extending his\r\n      line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths of\r\n      Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can\r\n      historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals, or\r\n      such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat\r\n      contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war not\r\n      only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French into the\r\n      heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia everything\r\n      was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his\r\n      line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek\r\n      battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.\nAt the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole aim\r\n      was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant\r\n      to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our Emperor\r\n      joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian soil and\r\n      not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel’s plan, and\r\n      there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor reproached the\r\n      commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could not bear the\r\n      idea of letting the enemy even reach Smolénsk, still less could he\r\n      contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did unite he was\r\n      displeased that Smolénsk was abandoned and burned without a general\r\n      engagement having been fought under its walls.\nSo thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still\r\n      more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the\r\n      depths of the country.\nNapoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and\r\n      missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at\r\n      Smolénsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now see\r\n      that advance was evidently ruinous to him.\nThe facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the\r\n      advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then think\r\n      of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of Napoleon into\r\n      the depths of the country was not the result of any plan, for no one\r\n      believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex interplay of\r\n      intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in the war and had\r\n      no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one way of saving\r\n      Russia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies were divided at the\r\n      commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident\r\n      intention of giving battle and checking the enemy’s advance, and by this\r\n      effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and\r\n      necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle—we led the\r\n      French on to Smolénsk. But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because\r\n      the French advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more\r\n      acute and we withdrew still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an\r\n      unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagratión (who would come under his\r\n      command), and Bagratión—being in command of the second army—tried\r\n      to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay’s command as long as he\r\n      could. Bagratión was slow in effecting the junction—though that was\r\n      the chief aim of all at headquarters—because, as he alleged, he\r\n      exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was best for him to\r\n      retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying the enemy from\r\n      flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his army; and it\r\n      looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the\r\n      detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior to his own.\nThe Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence and\r\n      ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of advisers and\r\n      plans, destroyed the first army’s energy and it retired.\nThe intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci, aiming\r\n      at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy to\r\n      influence Alexander, and Pfuel’s whole plan was abandoned and the command\r\n      entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence his power\r\n      was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of command, and\r\n      Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division, and the\r\n      unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted on the one\r\n      hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could not have\r\n      refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else, instead of\r\n      Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing indignation\r\n      against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.\nAt last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed\r\n      the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary\r\n      for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in\r\n      general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow the\r\n      strength of the Russian army was trebled.\nHe left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief’s undivided\r\n      control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then be\r\n      taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and\r\n      enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsarévich, and a swarm of adjutants general\r\n      remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation\r\n      and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under the\r\n      observation of all these “eyes of the Emperor,” became still more cautious\r\n      of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.\nBarclay stood for caution. The Tsarévich hinted at treachery and demanded\r\n      a general engagement. Lubomírski, Bronnítski, Wlocki, and the others of\r\n      that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under pretext of\r\n      sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish adjutants general\r\n      to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with Bennigsen and the\r\n      Tsarévich.\nAt Smolénsk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagratión disliked it.\nBagratión drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay. Barclay\r\n      donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer\r\n      Bagratión.\nDespite his seniority in rank Bagratión, in this contest of magnanimity,\r\n      took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed with him less\r\n      than ever. By the Emperor’s orders Bagratión reported direct to him. He\r\n      wrote to Arakchéev, the Emperor’s confidant: “It must be as my sovereign\r\n      pleases, but I cannot work with theMinister(meaning Barclay). For God’s\r\n      sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment. I cannot\r\n      stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian cannot\r\n      exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought I was really serving my\r\n      sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out that I am serving Barclay.\r\n      I confess I do not want to.”\nThe swarm of Bronnítskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further\r\n      embittered the relations between the commanders in chief, and even less\r\n      unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the French before\r\n      Smolénsk. A general was sent to survey the position. This general, hating\r\n      Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander, and, having\r\n      spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned, as unsuitable\r\n      from every point of view, the battleground he had not seen.\nWhile disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of\r\n      battle, and while we were looking for the French—having lost touch\r\n      with them—the French stumbled upon Nevérovski’s division and reached\r\n      the walls of Smolénsk.\nIt was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolénsk to save our\r\n      lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were killed on\r\n      both sides.\nSmolénsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the\r\n      whole people. But Smolénsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had been\r\n      misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting an example\r\n      to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own losses but\r\n      kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther and we retired, thus\r\n      arriving at the very result which caused his destruction."

    "text": "The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary to\r\n      come to his study.\n“Well? Are you satisfied now?” said he. “You’ve made me quarrel with my\r\n      son! Satisfied, are you? That’s all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts me,\r\n      it hurts. I’m old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then, gloat\r\n      over it! Gloat over it!”\nAfter that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was\r\n      ill and did not leave his study.\nPrincess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old\r\n      prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne either. Tíkhon alone attended him.\nAt the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of\r\n      life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations and\r\n      the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations\r\n      with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold tone to his daughter\r\n      seemed to say: “There, you see? You plotted against me, you lied to Prince\r\n      Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with\r\n      him, but you see I need neither her nor you!”\nPrincess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching his\r\n      lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to Dessalles;\r\n      the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her old nurse, or with\r\n      “God’s folk” who sometimes came by the back door to see her.\nOf the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She feared\r\n      for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at the strange\r\n      cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did not understand\r\n      the significance of this war, which seemed to her like all previous wars.\r\n      She did not realize the significance of this war, though Dessalles with\r\n      whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress\r\n      and tried to explain his own conception of it to her, and though the\r\n      “God’s folk” who came to see her reported, in their own way, the rumors\r\n      current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist, and though Julie\r\n      (now Princess Drubetskáya), who had resumed correspondence with her, wrote\r\n      patriotic letters from Moscow.\n“I write you in Russian, my good friend,” wrote Julie in her Frenchified\r\n      Russian, “because I have a detestation for all the French, and the same\r\n      for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in Moscow\r\n      are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.\n“My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the\r\n      news which I have inspires me yet more.\n“You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raévski, embracing his two\r\n      sons and saying: ‘I will perish with them but we will not be shaken!’ And\r\n      truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were unshakable. We\r\n      pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The princesses Aline and\r\n      Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy widows of live men, make\r\n      beautiful conversations over ourcharpie, only you, my friend, are\r\n      missing...” and so on.\nThe chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of\r\n      this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize it,\r\n      and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner. The prince’s tone\r\n      was so calm and confident that Princess Mary unhesitatingly believed him.\nAll that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated. He\r\n      planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs.\r\n      The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that he slept\r\n      very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual, changed his\r\n      sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp bed to be set up\r\n      in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the couch or on the\r\n      lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing, while—instead\r\n      of Mademoiselle Bourienne—a serf boy read to him. Then again he\r\n      would spend a night in the dining room.\nOn August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his first\r\n      letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had dutifully\r\n      asked his father’s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and\r\n      begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old prince had\r\n      replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the Frenchwoman at a\r\n      distance. Prince Andrew’s second letter, written near Vítebsk after the\r\n      French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of the whole campaign,\r\n      enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further\r\n      progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his\r\n      father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and\r\n      on the army’s direct line of march, and advised him to move to Moscow.\nAt dinner that day, on Dessalles’ mentioning that the French were said to\r\n      have already entered Vítebsk, the old prince remembered his son’s letter.\n“There was a letter from Prince Andrew today,” he said to Princess Mary—“Haven’t\r\n      you read it?”\n“No, Father,” she replied in a frightened voice.\nShe could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had\r\n      arrived.\n“He writes about this war,” said the prince, with the ironic smile that\r\n      had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.\n“That must be very interesting,” said Dessalles. “Prince Andrew is in a\r\n      position to know...”\n“Oh, very interesting!” said Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n“Go and get it for me,” said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne.\r\n      “You know—under the paperweight on the little table.”\nMademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.\n“No, don’t!” he exclaimed with a frown. “You go, Michael Ivánovich.”\nMichael Ivánovich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left\r\n      the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin and\r\n      went himself.\n“They can’t do anything... always make some muddle,” he muttered.\nWhile he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and\r\n      even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned\r\n      with quick steps, accompanied by Michael Ivánovich, bringing the letter\r\n      and a plan. These he put down beside him—not letting anyone read\r\n      them at dinner.\nOn moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and,\r\n      spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes\r\n      upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so Princess\r\n      Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the plan,\r\n      evidently engrossed in his own ideas.\n“What do you think of it, Prince?” Dessalles ventured to ask.\n“I? I?...” said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking his\r\n      eyes from the plan of the building.\n“Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...”\n“Ha ha ha! The theater of war!” said the prince. “I have said and still\r\n      say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get beyond\r\n      the Niemen.”\nDessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the Niemen\r\n      when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary, forgetting\r\n      the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what her father was\r\n      saying was correct.\n“When the snow melts they’ll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they could\r\n      fail to see it,” the prince continued, evidently thinking of the campaign\r\n      of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. “Bennigsen should have advanced\r\n      into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different turn...”\n“But, Prince,” Dessalles began timidly, “the letter mentions Vítebsk....”\n“Ah, the letter? Yes...” replied the prince peevishly. “Yes... yes...” His\r\n      face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. “Yes, he writes that\r\n      the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?”\nDessalles dropped his eyes.\n“The prince says nothing about that,” he remarked gently.\n“Doesn’t he? But I didn’t invent it myself.”\nNo one spoke for a long time.\n“Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivánovich,” he suddenly went on, raising his\r\n      head and pointing to the plan of the building, “tell me how you mean to\r\n      alter it....”\nMichael Ivánovich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to\r\n      him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and\r\n      went to his own room.\nPrincess Mary saw Dessalles’ embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her\r\n      father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her father\r\n      had forgotten his son’s letter on the drawing room table; but she was not\r\n      only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his confusion\r\n      and silence, but was afraid even to think about it.\nIn the evening Michael Ivánovich, sent by the prince, came to Princess\r\n      Mary for Prince Andrew’s letter which had been forgotten in the drawing\r\n      room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so,\r\n      ventured to ask him what her father was doing.\n“Always busy,” replied Michael Ivánovich with a respectfully ironic smile\r\n      which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. “He’s worrying very much about\r\n      the new building. He has been reading a little, but now”—Michael\r\n      Ivánovich went on, lowering his voice—“now he’s at his desk, busy\r\n      with his will, I expect.” (One of the prince’s favorite occupations of\r\n      late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his\r\n      death and which he called his “will.”)\n“And Alpátych is being sent to Smolénsk?” asked Princess Mary.\n“Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.”"

    "text": "When Michael Ivánovich returned to the study with the letter, the old\r\n      prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his\r\n      open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched\r\n      hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript—his\r\n      “Remarks” as he termed it—which was to be transmitted to the Emperor\r\n      after his death.\nWhen Michael Ivánovich went in there were tears in the prince’s eyes\r\n      evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had\r\n      been written. He took the letter from Michael Ivánovich’s hand, put it in\r\n      his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alpátych who had long been\r\n      waiting.\nThe prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolénsk and, walking up\r\n      and down the room past Alpátych who stood by the door, he gave his\r\n      instructions.\n“First, notepaper—do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample,\r\n      gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax, as\r\n      in Michael Ivánovich’s list.”\nHe paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.\n“Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.”\nNext, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of\r\n      a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case had to\r\n      be ordered to keep the “will” in.\nThe instructions to Alpátych took over two hours and still the prince did\r\n      not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and dozed\r\n      off. Alpátych made a slight movement.\n“Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I’ll send after you.”\nAlpátych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it,\r\n      fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table to\r\n      write to the governor.\nIt was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished to\r\n      sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing\r\n      thoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tíkhon and went through the\r\n      rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.\nHe went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed unsatisfactory,\r\n      but worst of all was his customary couch in the study. That couch was\r\n      dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had\r\n      when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere, but the corner behind\r\n      the piano in the sitting room was better than other places: he had never\r\n      slept there yet.\nWith the help of a footman Tíkhon brought in the bedstead and began\r\n      putting it up.\n“That’s not right! That’s not right!” cried the prince, and himself pushed\r\n      it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.\n“Well, at last I’ve finished, now I’ll rest,” thought the prince, and let\r\n      Tíkhon undress him.\nFrowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his\r\n      coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the bed, and\r\n      appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered\r\n      yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the moment of\r\n      making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed. “Ugh,\r\n      how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end andyouwould release me!”\r\n       thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that effort for the\r\n      twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had he done so before he\r\n      felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were\r\n      breathing heavily and jolting. This happened to him almost every night. He\r\n      opened his eyes as they were closing.\n“No peace, damn them!” he muttered, angry he knew not with\r\n      whom. “Ah yes, there was something else important, very important,\r\n      that I was keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him\r\n      about them. No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess\r\n      Mary talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something\r\n      in my pocket—can’t remember....”\n“Tíkhon, what did we talk about at dinner?”\n“About Prince Michael...”\n“Be quiet, quiet!” The prince slapped his hand on the table. “Yes, I know,\r\n      Prince Andrew’s letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said something\r\n      about Vítebsk. Now I’ll read it.”\nHe had the letter taken from his pocket and the table—on which stood\r\n      a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle—moved close to the bed,\r\n      and putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness\r\n      of the night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he\r\n      grasp its meaning for a moment.\n“The French at Vítebsk, in four days’ march they may be at Smolénsk;\r\n      perhaps are already there! Tíkhon!” Tíkhon jumped up. “No, no, I don’t\r\n      want anything!” he shouted.\nHe put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there\r\n      rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian camp, and\r\n      himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face, vigorous and\r\n      alert, entering Potëmkin’s gaily colored tent, and a burning sense of\r\n      jealousy of “the favorite” agitated him now as strongly as it had done\r\n      then. He recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with\r\n      Potëmkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather sallow-faced, short, stout\r\n      woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile and her words at her first\r\n      gracious reception of him, and then that same face on the catafalque, and\r\n      the encounter he had with Zúbov over her coffin about his right to kiss\r\n      her hand.\n“Oh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all the\r\n      present! Quicker, quicker—and that they should leave me in peace!”"

    "text": "Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski’s estate, lay forty miles east from\r\n      Smolénsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.\nThe same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpátych,\r\n      Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the prince\r\n      was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety, though\r\n      from Prince Andrew’s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills\r\n      might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter by\r\n      Alpátych to the Provincial Governor at Smolénsk, asking him to let her\r\n      know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills\r\n      was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess\r\n      Mary, she signed it, and it was given to Alpátych with instructions to\r\n      hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there\r\n      was danger.\nHaving received all his orders Alpátych, wearing a white beaver hat—a\r\n      present from the prince—and carrying a stick as the prince did, went\r\n      out accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed\r\n      to a small conveyance with a leather hood.\nThe larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed\r\n      with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with ringing\r\n      bells; but on a long journey Alpátych liked to have them. His satellites—the\r\n      senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid, a cook, two old\r\n      women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various domestic serfs—were\r\n      seeing him off.\nHis daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and\r\n      behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one\r\n      of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.\n“There! There! Women’s fuss! Women, women!” said Alpátych, puffing and\r\n      speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap.\nAfter giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alpátych, not\r\n      trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and\r\n      crossed himself three times.\n“If there is anything... come back, Yákov Alpátych! For Christ’s sake\r\n      think of us!” cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the\r\n      enemy.\n“Women, women! Women’s fuss!” muttered Alpátych to himself and started on\r\n      his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the\r\n      still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just\r\n      being plowed a second time.\nAs he went along he looked with pleasure at the year’s splendid crop of\r\n      corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already\r\n      being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest, and\r\n      asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the prince’s orders.\nHaving baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward\r\n      evening on the fourth of August.\nAlpátych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the\r\n      road. As he approached Smolénsk he heard the sounds of distant firing, but\r\n      these did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a\r\n      splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was\r\n      being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact impressed\r\n      Alpátych, but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it.\nAll the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded\r\n      by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit. Everything\r\n      not connected with the execution of the prince’s orders did not interest\r\n      and did not even exist for Alpátych.\nOn reaching Smolénsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up in\r\n      the Gáchina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferapóntov,\r\n      where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years.\r\n      Some thirty years ago Ferapóntov, by Alpátych’s advice, had bought a wood\r\n      from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an inn, and a\r\n      corn dealer’s shop in that province. He was a stout, dark, red-faced\r\n      peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a nose, similar\r\n      knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.\nWearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapóntov was standing before\r\n      his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alpátych he went up to\r\n      him.\n“You’re welcome, Yákov Alpátych. Folks are leaving the town, but you have\r\n      come to it,” said he.\n“Why are they leaving the town?” asked Alpátych.\n“That’s what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.”\n“Women’s fuss, women’s fuss!” said Alpátych.\n“Just what I think, Yákov Alpátych. What I say is: orders have been given\r\n      not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are asking\r\n      three rubles for carting—it isn’t Christian!”\nYákov Alpátych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for hay\r\n      for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.\nAll night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning Alpátych\r\n      donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a\r\n      sunny morning and by eight o’clock it was already hot. “A good day for\r\n      harvesting,” thought Alpátych.\nFrom beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight\r\n      o’clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many\r\n      people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers, but\r\n      cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and service\r\n      was being held in the churches as usual. Alpátych went to the shops, to\r\n      government offices, to the post office, and to the Governor’s. In the\r\n      offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the\r\n      army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town, everybody was\r\n      asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm one another.\nIn front of the Governor’s house Alpátych found a large number of people,\r\n      Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor’s. At the porch he met\r\n      two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an ex-captain of\r\n      police, was saying angrily:\n“It’s no joke, you know! It’s all very well if you’re single. ‘One man\r\n      though undone is but one,’ as the proverb says, but with thirteen in your\r\n      family and all the property... They’ve brought us to utter ruin! What sort\r\n      of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged—the\r\n      brigands!...”\n“Oh come, that’s enough!” said the other.\n“What do I care? Let him hear! We’re not dogs,” said the ex-captain of\r\n      police, and looking round he noticed Alpátych.\n“Oh, Yákov Alpátych! What have you come for?”\n“To see the Governor by his excellency’s order,” answered Alpátych,\r\n      lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his coat\r\n      as he always did when he mentioned the prince.... “He has ordered me to\r\n      inquire into the position of affairs,” he added.\n“Yes, go and find out!” shouted the angry gentleman. “They’ve brought\r\n      things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it is\r\n      again, do you hear?” said he, pointing in the direction whence came the\r\n      sounds of firing.\n“They’ve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!” he repeated, and\r\n      descended the porch steps.\nAlpátych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were\r\n      tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The door\r\n      of the Governor’s room opened and they all rose and moved forward. An\r\n      official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout official\r\n      with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished again,\r\n      evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to\r\n      him. Alpátych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed\r\n      him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat, and handed him\r\n      two letters.\n“To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkónski,” he\r\n      announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to\r\n      him and took the letters.\nA few minutes later the Governor received Alpátych and hurriedly said to\r\n      him:\n“Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the\r\n      highest instructions—here...” and he handed a paper to Alpátych.\r\n      “Still, as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to\r\n      Moscow. I am just starting myself. Inform them...”\nBut the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the\r\n      room and began to say something in French. The Governor’s face expressed\r\n      terror.\n“Go,” he said, nodding his head to Alpátych, and began questioning the\r\n      officer.\nEager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpátych when he came\r\n      out of the Governor’s room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing,\r\n      which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, Alpátych hurried to\r\n      his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:\n“I assure you that the town of Smolénsk is not in the slightest danger as\r\n      yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any. I from the one\r\n      side and Prince Bagratión from the other are marching to unite our forces\r\n      before Smolénsk, which junction will be effected on the 22nd instant, and\r\n      both armies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the\r\n      province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back\r\n      the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last warrior in our valiant\r\n      ranks has perished. From this you will see that you have a perfect right\r\n      to reassure the inhabitants of Smolénsk, for those defended by two such\r\n      brave armies may feel assured of victory.” (Instructions from Barclay de\r\n      Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of Smolénsk, 1812.)\nPeople were anxiously roaming about the streets.\nCarts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept\r\n      emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets. Loaded\r\n      carts stood at the house next to Ferapóntov’s and women were wailing and\r\n      lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round barking in\r\n      front of the harnessed horses.\nAlpátych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went\r\n      straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was\r\n      asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage.\r\n      From the host’s room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing\r\n      sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of Ferapóntov. The cook\r\n      began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen,\r\n      just as Alpátych entered.\n“He’s done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her\r\n      about so!...”\n“What for?” asked Alpátych.\n“She kept begging to go away. She’s a woman! ‘Take me away,’ says she,\r\n      ‘don’t let me perish with my little children! Folks,’ she says, ‘are all\r\n      gone, so why,’ she says, ‘don’t we go?’ And he began beating and pulling\r\n      her about so!”\nAt these words Alpátych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to hear\r\n      more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper’s, where he had\r\n      left his purchases.\n“You brute, you murderer!” screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby in\r\n      her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the door at\r\n      that moment and down the steps into the yard.\nFerapóntov came out after her, but on seeing Alpátych adjusted his\r\n      waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpátych into the\r\n      opposite room.\n“Going already?” said he.\nAlpátych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages\r\n      and asked how much he owed.\n“We’ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor’s?” asked\r\n      Ferapóntov. “What has been decided?”\nAlpátych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.\n“With our business, how can we get away?” said Ferapóntov. “We’d have to\r\n      pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobúzh and I tell them they’re not\r\n      Christians to ask it! Selivánov, now, did a good stroke last Thursday—sold\r\n      flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have some tea?” he\r\n      added.\nWhile the horses were being harnessed Alpátych and Ferapóntov over their\r\n      tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for\r\n      harvesting.\n“Well, it seems to be getting quieter,” remarked Ferapóntov, finishing his\r\n      third cup of tea and getting up. “Ours must have got the best of it. The\r\n      orders were not to let them in. So we’re in force, it seems.... They say\r\n      the other day Matthew Iványch Plátov drove them into the river Márina and\r\n      drowned some eighteen thousand in one day.”\nAlpátych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come\r\n      in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and\r\n      bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.\nIt was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the\r\n      other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpátych looked out of the window and\r\n      went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling and\r\n      thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar\r\n      that set the windows rattling.\nHe went out into the street: two men were running past toward the bridge.\r\n      From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls\r\n      and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds were hardly\r\n      heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and\r\n      attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was being\r\n      bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered up after\r\n      four o’clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of this\r\n      bombardment.\nAt first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity.\r\n      Ferapóntov’s wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed,\r\n      became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate, listening to\r\n      the sounds and looking in silence at the people.\nThe cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity\r\n      everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their\r\n      heads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.\n“What force!” remarked one. “Knocked the roof and ceiling all to\r\n      splinters!”\n“Routed up the earth like a pig,” said another.\n“That’s grand, it bucks one up!” laughed the first. “Lucky you jumped\r\n      aside, or it would have wiped you out!”\nOthers joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen\r\n      on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with the\r\n      swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable\r\n      intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people’s heads incessantly, but\r\n      not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alpátych was getting into his\r\n      trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.\n“What are you staring at?” he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt,\r\n      with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the\r\n      corner to listen to what was being said.\n“What marvels!” she exclaimed, but hearing her master’s voice she turned\r\n      back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.\nOnce more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping\r\n      downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the street,\r\n      something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.\n“Scoundrel, what are you doing?” shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the\r\n      cook.\nAt that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different\r\n      sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently with\r\n      pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her\r\n      wailing.\n“Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don’t let me die! My good souls!...”\nFive minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her thigh\r\n      broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen. Alpátych,\r\n      his coachman, Ferapóntov’s wife and children and the house porter were all\r\n      sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the whistling of\r\n      projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook, which rose above the\r\n      other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress rocked and hushed\r\n      her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper\r\n      what had become of her husband who had remained in the street. A shopman\r\n      who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the\r\n      cathedral, whence they were fetching the wonder-working icon of Smolénsk.\nToward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpátych left the cellar and\r\n      stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was clouded\r\n      with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon shone\r\n      strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed\r\n      to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps, the\r\n      moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed\r\n      widespread everywhere. The cook’s moans had now subsided. On two sides\r\n      black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through the\r\n      streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different\r\n      directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them ran into\r\n      Ferapóntov’s yard before Alpátych’s eyes. Alpátych went out to the gate. A\r\n      retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the street.\nNoticing him, an officer said: “The town is being abandoned. Get away, get\r\n      away!” and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:\n“I’ll teach you to run into the yards!”\nAlpátych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to set\r\n      off. Ferapóntov’s whole household came out too, following Alpátych and the\r\n      coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly began to wail\r\n      as they looked at the fires—the smoke and even the flames of which\r\n      could be seen in the failing twilight—and as if in reply the same\r\n      kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street. Inside the\r\n      shed Alpátych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of\r\n      their horses with trembling hands.\nAs Alpátych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in\r\n      Ferapóntov’s open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and\r\n      knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapóntov returned\r\n      and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at\r\n      them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs and\r\n      laughter:\n“Loot everything, lads! Don’t let those devils get it!” he cried, taking\r\n      some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.\nSome of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on filling\r\n      their bags. On seeing Alpátych, Ferapóntov turned to him:\n“Russia is done for!” he cried. “Alpátych, I’ll set the place on fire\r\n      myself. We’re done for!...” and Ferapóntov ran into the yard.\nSoldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it\r\n      completely, so that Alpátych could not pass out and had to wait.\r\n      Ferapóntov’s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till it\r\n      was possible to drive out.\nNight had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out\r\n      amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper\r\n      Alpátych’s cart and that of the innkeeper’s wife, which were slowly moving\r\n      amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop. In a side\r\n      street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a house and\r\n      some shops were on fire. This fire was already burning itself out. The\r\n      flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now suddenly flared\r\n      up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the\r\n      people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures flitted about before the\r\n      fire, and through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and\r\n      shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on\r\n      for some time, Alpátych got down and turned into the side street to look\r\n      at the fire. Soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near\r\n      it, and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning\r\n      beams into another yard across the street, while others carried bundles of\r\n      hay.\nAlpátych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was\r\n      blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen\r\n      in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The crowd\r\n      was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and Alpátych watched for\r\n      it too.\n“Alpátych!” a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.\n“Mercy on us! Your excellency!” answered Alpátych, immediately recognizing\r\n      the voice of his young prince.\nPrince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking\r\n      at Alpátych from the back of the crowd.\n“Why are you here?” he asked.\n“Your... your excellency,” stammered Alpátych and broke into sobs. “Are we\r\n      really lost? Master!...”\n“Why are you here?” Prince Andrew repeated.\nAt that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master’s pale\r\n      worn face. Alpátych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it\r\n      was to get away.\n“Are we really quite lost, your excellency?” he asked again.\nPrince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee\r\n      began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:\n“Smolénsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy\r\n      within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when\r\n      you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyázh.”\nHaving written this and given the paper to Alpátych, he told him how to\r\n      arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the boy’s\r\n      tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before he had had\r\n      time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff followed by a\r\n      suite galloped up to him.\n“You are a colonel?” shouted the chief of staff with a German accent, in a\r\n      voice familiar to Prince Andrew. “Houses are set on fire in your presence\r\n      and you stand by! What does this mean? You will answer for it!” shouted\r\n      Berg, who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the commander of the\r\n      left flank of the infantry of the first army, a place, as Berg said, “very\r\n      agreeable and wellen évidence.”\nPrince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to\r\n      Alpátych.\n“So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by the\r\n      tenth I don’t receive news that they have all got away I shall have to\r\n      throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.”\n“Prince,” said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, “I only spoke because I\r\n      have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly.... You must please\r\n      excuse me,” he went on apologetically.\nSomething cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and\r\n      wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another\r\n      terrible crash and something huge collapsed.\n“Ou-rou-rou!” yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof\r\n      of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all\r\n      around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted,\r\n      exhausted faces of the spectators.\nThe man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:\n“It’s fine, lads! Now it’s raging... It’s fine!”\n“That’s the owner himself,” cried several voices.\n“Well then,” continued Prince Andrew to Alpátych, “report to them as I\r\n      have told you”; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside\r\n      him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street."

    "text": "From Smolénsk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy. On\r\n      the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching\r\n      along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and drought\r\n      had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy clouds floated\r\n      across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward evening the sky\r\n      cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist. Heavy night dews\r\n      alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was scorched and shed its\r\n      grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no food\r\n      on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and in the forests while the dew\r\n      lasted was there any freshness. But on the road, the highroad along which\r\n      the troops marched, there was no such freshness even at night or when the\r\n      road passed through the forest; the dew was imperceptible on the sandy\r\n      dust churned up more than six inches deep. As soon as day dawned the march\r\n      began. The artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep\r\n      dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank\r\n      ankle-deep in that soft, choking, hot dust that never cooled even at\r\n      night. Some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the\r\n      rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears,\r\n      hair, and nostrils, and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as\r\n      they moved along that road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that\r\n      cloud of dust, and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could\r\n      look with naked eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in\r\n      the unclouded sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that\r\n      motionless atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their\r\n      noses and mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to\r\n      the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.\nPrince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that\r\n      regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and giving\r\n      orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolénsk and its abandonment made an\r\n      epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against the foe made him\r\n      forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the affairs of his\r\n      regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers. In the\r\n      regiment they called him “our prince,” were proud of him and loved him.\r\n      But he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment, to Timókhin and\r\n      the like—people quite new to him, belonging to a different world and\r\n      who could not know and understand his past. As soon as he came across a\r\n      former acquaintance or anyone from the staff, he bristled up immediately\r\n      and grew spiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. Everything that reminded\r\n      him of his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that\r\n      former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be\r\n      unfair.\nIn truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince\r\n      Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolénsk on the sixth of\r\n      August (he considered that it could and should have been defended) and\r\n      after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to pillage his\r\n      dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled. But despite\r\n      this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to think about\r\n      entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously he had received\r\n      news that his father, son, and sister had left for Moscow; and though\r\n      there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a\r\n      characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride\r\n      there.\nHe ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the march,\r\n      rode to his father’s estate where he had been born and spent his\r\n      childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of\r\n      women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden\r\n      beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that\r\n      the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was\r\n      floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper’s\r\n      lodge. No one was at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood\r\n      open. Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and horses and\r\n      calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode up to the\r\n      hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the trees in tubs\r\n      some were overturned and others dried up. He called for Tarás the\r\n      gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round the corner of the hothouse\r\n      to the ornamental garden, he saw that the carved garden fence was broken\r\n      and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit. An old\r\n      peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was\r\n      sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast shoe.\nHe was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on the\r\n      seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of bast\r\n      were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.\nPrince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had\r\n      been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of\r\n      the house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at\r\n      one window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran\r\n      into the house. Alpátych, having sent his family away, was alone at Bald\r\n      Hills and was sitting indoors reading theLives of the Saints. On hearing\r\n      that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on his nose,\r\n      buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word began weeping\r\n      and kissing Prince Andrew’s knee.\nThen, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report on the\r\n      position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been removed to\r\n      Boguchárovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away. The hay\r\n      and the spring corn, of which Alpátych said there had been a remarkable\r\n      crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while\r\n      still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too had gone to\r\n      Boguchárovo, only a few remained.\nWithout waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:\n“When did my father and sister leave?” meaning when did they leave for\r\n      Moscow.\nAlpátych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for\r\n      Boguchárovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went into\r\n      details concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.\n“Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them? We\r\n      have still six hundred quarters left,” he inquired.\n“What am I to say to him?” thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the old\r\n      man’s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on his\r\n      face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions were\r\n      and only asked them to allay his grief.\n“Yes, let them have it,” replied Prince Andrew.\n“If you noticed some disorder in the garden,” said Alpátych, “it was\r\n      impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent the\r\n      night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their commanding\r\n      officer, to hand in a complaint about it.”\n“Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy\r\n      occupies the place?” asked Prince Andrew.\nAlpátych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly\r\n      with a solemn gesture raised his arm.\n“He is my refuge! His will be done!” he exclaimed.\nA group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward\r\n      the prince.\n“Well, good-by!” said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpátych. “You must\r\n      go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the Ryazán\r\n      estate or to the one near Moscow.”\nAlpátych clung to Prince Andrew’s leg and burst into sobs. Gently\r\n      disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue\r\n      at a gallop.\nThe old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly\r\n      impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on\r\n      which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out from\r\n      the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the\r\n      trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master, the\r\n      elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand\r\n      and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some green\r\n      plums they had dropped.\nPrince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them see\r\n      that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened little\r\n      girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible desire to\r\n      do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when, seeing\r\n      these girls, he realized the existence of other human interests entirely\r\n      aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him.\r\n      Evidently these girls passionately desired one thing—to carry away\r\n      and eat those green plums without being caught—and Prince Andrew\r\n      shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He could not resist\r\n      looking at them once more. Believing their danger past, they sprang from\r\n      their ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill little voices and\r\n      holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned feet scampered\r\n      merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.\nPrince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty\r\n      highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills\r\n      he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting\r\n      place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one o’clock. The sun, a red\r\n      ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably through\r\n      his black coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk\r\n      that came from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he crossed the\r\n      dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond. He longed to\r\n      get into that water, however dirty it might be, and he glanced round at\r\n      the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small,\r\n      muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam,\r\n      because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red\r\n      hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing about in it. All this naked\r\n      white human flesh, laughing and shrieking, floundered about in that dirty\r\n      pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the suggestion of\r\n      merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic.\nOne fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew\r\n      knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself,\r\n      stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another, a\r\n      dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his waist\r\n      in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted with\r\n      satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened to\r\n      the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another, yelling, and\r\n      puffing.\nEverywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy,\r\n      white, muscular flesh. The officer, Timókhin, with his red little nose,\r\n      standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing\r\n      the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.\n“It’s very nice, your excellency! Wouldn’t you like to?” said he.\n“It’s dirty,” replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.\n“We’ll clear it out for you in a minute,” said Timókhin, and, still\r\n      undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.\n“The prince wants to bathe.”\n“What prince? Ours?” said many voices, and the men were in such haste to\r\n      clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he would\r\n      rather wash himself with water in the barn.\n“Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!” he thought, and he looked at his own naked\r\n      body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror\r\n      he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that immense number\r\n      of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.\n\nOn the seventh of August Prince Bagratión wrote as follows from his\r\n      quarters at Mikháylovna on the Smolénsk road:\nDear Count Aléxis Andréevich—(He was writing to Arakchéev but knew\r\n      that his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every\r\n      word in it to the best of his ability.)\nI expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the\r\n      abandonment of Smolénsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and the\r\n      whole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly\r\n      abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently and finally\r\n      wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear to you on my\r\n      honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost\r\n      half his army but could not have taken Smolénsk. Our troops fought, and\r\n      are fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy\r\n      at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; buthewould not hold out even\r\n      for fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and as for\r\n      him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If he reports that our losses\r\n      were great, it is not true; perhaps about four thousand, not more, and not\r\n      even that; but even were they ten thousand, that’s war! But the enemy has\r\n      lost masses....\nWhat would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would\r\n      have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men or\r\n      horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent\r\n      instructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this way,\r\n      or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow....\nThere is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you\r\n      should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You\r\n      would set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed to\r\n      wear the uniform. If it has come to this—we must fight as long as\r\n      Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand....\nOne man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps be\r\n      good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable,\r\n      yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I am really\r\n      frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear that the man\r\n      who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the Minister should\r\n      command the army, does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us\r\n      all. So I write you frankly: call out the militia. For the Minister is\r\n      leading these visitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly way. The\r\n      whole army feels great suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He\r\n      is said to be more Napoleon’s man than ours, and he is always advising the\r\n      Minister. I am not merely civil to him but obey him like a corporal,\r\n      though I am his senior. This is painful, but, loving my benefactor and\r\n      sovereign, I submit. Only I am sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our\r\n      fine army to such as he. Consider that on our retreat we have lost by\r\n      fatigue and left in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had\r\n      we attacked this would not have happened. Tell me, for God’s sake, what\r\n      will Russia, our mother Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why\r\n      are we abandoning our good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and\r\n      implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we\r\n      scared at and of whom are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister\r\n      is vacillating, a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The\r\n      whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him...."

    "text": "Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human life\r\n      one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and those\r\n      in which form prevails. To the latter—as distinguished from village,\r\n      country, provincial, or even Moscow life—we may allot Petersburg\r\n      life, and especially the life of its salons. That life of the salons is\r\n      unchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again quarreled\r\n      with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again, but the\r\n      salons of Anna Pávlovna and Hélène remained just as they had been—the\r\n      one seven and the other five years before. At Anna Pávlovna’s they talked\r\n      with perplexity of Bonaparte’s successes just as before and saw in them\r\n      and in the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns a\r\n      malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness\r\n      and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna Pávlovna was the\r\n      representative. And in Hélène’s salon, which Rumyántsev himself honored\r\n      with his visits, regarding Hélène as a remarkably intelligent woman, they\r\n      talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808 of the “great nation” and\r\n      the “great man,” and regretted our rupture with France, a rupture which,\r\n      according to them, ought to be promptly terminated by peace.\nOf late, since the Emperor’s return from the army, there had been some\r\n      excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of\r\n      hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency. In Anna\r\n      Pávlovna’s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were deep-rooted\r\n      legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one\r\n      ought not to go to the French theater and that to maintain the French\r\n      troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps. The\r\n      progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only the reports most\r\n      flattering to our army were circulated. In the French circle of Hélène and\r\n      Rumyántsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were\r\n      contradicted and all Napoleon’s attempts at conciliation were discussed.\r\n      In that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations\r\n      for a removal to Kazán of the court and the girls’ educational\r\n      establishments under the patronage of the Dowager Empress. In Hélène’s\r\n      circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal\r\n      demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the view prevailed\r\n      expressed by Bilíbin—who now in Petersburg was quite at home in\r\n      Hélène’s house, which every clever man was obliged to visit—that not\r\n      by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled. In\r\n      that circle the Moscow enthusiasm—news of which had reached\r\n      Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor’s return—was ridiculed\r\n      sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.\nAnna Pávlovna’s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm\r\n      and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients. Prince\r\n      Vasíli, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a connecting\r\n      link between these two circles. He visited his “good friend Anna Pávlovna”\r\n       as well as his daughter’s “diplomatic salon,” and often in his constant\r\n      comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at\r\n      Hélène’s what he should have said at Anna Pávlovna’s and vice versa.\nSoon after the Emperor’s return Prince Vasíli in a conversation about the\r\n      war at Anna Pávlovna’s severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was\r\n      undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the\r\n      visitors, usually spoken of as “a man of great merit,” having described\r\n      how he had that day seen Kutúzov, the newly chosen chief of the Petersburg\r\n      militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the Treasury,\r\n      cautiously ventured to suggest that Kutúzov would be the man to satisfy\r\n      all requirements.\nAnna Pávlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutúzov had done\r\n      nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.\n“I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,” Prince Vasíli\r\n      interrupted, “but they did not listen to me. I told them his election as\r\n      chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They did not listen to\r\n      me.\n“It’s all this mania for opposition,” he went on. “And who for? It is all\r\n      because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,” Prince\r\n      Vasíli continued, forgetting for a moment that though at Hélène’s one had\r\n      to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna Pávlovna’s one had to be\r\n      ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. “Now, is it\r\n      suitable that Count Kutúzov, the oldest general in Russia, should preside\r\n      at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains! How could they make a\r\n      man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops asleep at a\r\n      council, and has the very worst morals! A good reputation he made for\r\n      himself at Bucharest! I don’t speak of his capacity as a general, but at a\r\n      time like this how they appoint a decrepit, blind old man, positively\r\n      blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He can’t see anything. To play\r\n      blindman’s buff? He can’t see at all!”\nNo one replied to his remarks.\nThis was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the\r\n      twenty-ninth of July Kutúzov received the title of Prince. This might\r\n      indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vasíli’s opinion\r\n      continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express it.\r\n      But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal\r\n      Saltykóv, Arakchéev, Vyazmítinov, Lopukhín, and Kochubéy met to consider\r\n      the progress of the war. This committee came to the conclusion that our\r\n      failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the members\r\n      of the committee were aware of the Emperor’s dislike of Kutúzov, after a\r\n      short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in\r\n      chief. That same day Kutúzov was appointed commander in chief with full\r\n      powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them.\nOn the ninth of August Prince Vasíli at Anna Pávlovna’s again met the “man\r\n      of great merit.” The latter was very attentive to Anna Pávlovna because he\r\n      wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments\r\n      for young ladies. Prince Vasíli entered the room with the air of a happy\r\n      conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.\n“Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutúzov is field marshal! All\r\n      dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last we have a\r\n      man!” said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the\r\n      drawing room.\nThe “man of great merit,” despite his desire to obtain the post of\r\n      director, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasíli of his former\r\n      opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vasíli in Anna Pávlovna’s\r\n      drawing room, and also to Anna Pávlovna herself who had received the news\r\n      with delight, he could not resist the temptation.\n“But, Prince, they say he is blind!” said he, reminding Prince Vasíli of\r\n      his own words.\n“Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,” said Prince Vasíli rapidly, in a deep\r\n      voice and with a slight cough—the voice and cough with which he was\r\n      wont to dispose of all difficulties.\n“He sees well enough,” he added. “And what I am so pleased about,” he went\r\n      on, “is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies\r\n      and the whole region—powers no commander in chief ever had before.\r\n      He is a second autocrat,” he concluded with a victorious smile.\n“God grant it! God grant it!” said Anna Pávlovna.\nThe “man of great merit,” who was still a novice in court circles,\r\n      wishing to flatter Anna Pávlovna by defending her former position on this\r\n      question, observed:\n“It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutúzov those powers.\r\n      They say he blushed like a girl to whomJocondeis read, when he said to\r\n      Kutúzov: ‘Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.’”\n“Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech,” said Anna Pávlovna.\n“Oh, no, no!” warmly rejoined Prince Vasíli, who would not now yield\r\n      Kutúzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutúzov was not only admirable himself,\r\n      but was adored by everybody. “No, that’s impossible,” said he,\r\n      “for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.”\n“God grant only that Prince Kutúzov assumes real power and does not allowanyoneto put a spoke in his wheel,” observed Anna Pávlovna.\nUnderstanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasíli said in a\r\n      whisper:\n“I know for a fact that Kutúzov made it an absolute condition that the\r\n      Tsarévich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the\r\n      Emperor?”\nAnd Prince Vasíli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by\r\n      Kutúzov to the Emperor. “I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor\r\n      reward him if he does right.”\n“Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutúzov! I have known him a long time!”\n“They even say,” remarked the “man of great merit” who did not yet possess\r\n      courtly tact, “that his excellency made it an express condition that the\r\n      sovereign himself should not be with the army.”\nAs soon as he said this both Prince Vasíli and Anna Pávlovna turned away\r\n      from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naïveté."

    "text": "While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already passed\r\n      Smolénsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napoleon’s\r\n      historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his hero\r\n      says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will. He is as\r\n      right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic events\r\n      in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians who\r\n      maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the Russian\r\n      commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards all the\r\n      past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur, the law of\r\n      reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good chessplayer\r\n      having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a\r\n      mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening, but forgets\r\n      that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none\r\n      of his moves were perfect. He only notices the mistake to which he pays\r\n      attention, because his opponent took advantage of it. How much more\r\n      complex than this is the game of war, which occurs under certain limits of\r\n      time, and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects, but\r\n      everything results from innumerable conflicts of various wills!\nAfter Smolénsk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobúzh at Vyázma, and\r\n      then at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction of\r\n      innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till they\r\n      reached Borodinó, seventy miles from Moscow. From Vyázma Napoleon ordered\r\n      a direct advance on Moscow.\nMoscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacrée des\r\n      peuples d’Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables églises en forme de\r\n      pagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleon’s imagination no rest. On\r\n      the march from Vyázma to Tsárevo-Zaymíshche he rode his light bay\r\n      bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages, and\r\n      aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to question a\r\n      Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by Lelorgne d’Ideville,\r\n      an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse\r\n      with an amused expression.\n* “Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the\r\n     sacred city of Alexander’s people, Moscow with its\r\n     innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.”\n“Well?” asked Napoleon.\n“One of Plátov’s Cossacks says that Plátov’s corps is joining up with the\r\n      main army and that Kutúzov has been appointed commander in chief. He is a\r\n      very shrewd and garrulous fellow.”\nNapoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the\r\n      man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped\r\n      off, and an hour later, Lavrúshka, the serf Denísov had handed over to\r\n      Rostóv, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly’s jacket and on a French cavalry\r\n      saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride by his\r\n      side and began questioning him.\n“You are a Cossack?”\n“Yes, a Cossack, your Honor.”\n“The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon’s plain\r\n      appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind the\r\n      presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of\r\n      the war,” says Thiers, narrating this episode. In reality Lavrúshka,\r\n      having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless, had been\r\n      whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens, where he engaged in\r\n      looting till the French took him prisoner. Lavrúshka was one of those\r\n      coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things, consider it\r\n      necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way, are ready to render\r\n      any sort of service to their master, and are keen at guessing their\r\n      master’s baser impulses, especially those prompted by vanity and\r\n      pettiness.\nFinding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily\r\n      and surely recognized, Lavrúshka was not in the least abashed but merely\r\n      did his utmost to gain his new master’s favor.\nHe knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon’s presence could no\r\n      more intimidate him than Rostóv’s, or a sergeant major’s with the rods,\r\n      would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or\r\n      Napoleon could deprive him of.\nSo he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the orderlies.\r\n      Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the Russians thought\r\n      they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrúshka screwed up his eyes and\r\n      considered.\nIn this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning in\r\n      everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.\n“It’s like this,” he said thoughtfully, “if there’s a battle soon, yours\r\n      will win. That’s right. But if three days pass, then after that, well,\r\n      then that same battle will not soon be over.”\nLelorgne d’Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus:\r\n      “If a battle takes place within the next three days the French will win,\r\n      but if later, God knows what will happen.” Napoleon did not smile, though\r\n      he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words to be\r\n      repeated.\nLavrúshka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to\r\n      know who Napoleon was, added:\n“We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the\r\n      world, but we are a different matter...”—without knowing why or how\r\n      this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.\nThe interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and\r\n      Bonaparte smiled. “The young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile,”\r\n       says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence, Napoleon turned to\r\n      Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the\r\n      Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who had written his immortally\r\n      victorious name on the Pyramids, would affect thisenfant du Don. *\n* “Child of the Don.”\nThe fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrúshka.\nLavrúshka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that\r\n      Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters\r\n      promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes wide,\r\n      and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped. “As\r\n      soon as Napoleon’s interpreter had spoken,” says Thiers, “the Cossack,\r\n      seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode on, his eyes\r\n      fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of\r\n      the East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naïve\r\n      and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after making the Cossack a\r\n      present, had him set free like a bird restored to its native fields.”\nNapoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his\r\n      imagination, and “the bird restored to its native fields” galloped to our\r\n      outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he\r\n      meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did not\r\n      wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He found the\r\n      Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with Plátov’s detachment and\r\n      by evening found his master, Nicholas Rostóv, quartered at Yankóvo. Rostóv\r\n      was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with\r\n      Ilyín; he let Lavrúshka have another horse and took him along with him."

    "text": "Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew\r\n      supposed.\nAfter the return of Alpátych from Smolénsk the old prince suddenly seemed\r\n      to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called up from\r\n      the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in chief\r\n      informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last\r\n      extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief’s discretion\r\n      to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where one of\r\n      Russia’s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he announced to\r\n      his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.\nBut while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of the\r\n      princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguchárovo and thence to\r\n      Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her father’s feverish and sleepless\r\n      activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to leave him\r\n      alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him. She\r\n      refused to go away and her father’s fury broke over her in a terrible\r\n      storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to\r\n      convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with\r\n      his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her\r\n      life to poison his existence, and he drove her from his study telling her\r\n      that if she did not go away it was all the same to him. He declared that\r\n      he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to\r\n      let him see her. The fact that he did not, as she had feared, order her to\r\n      be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered\r\n      Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof that in the depth of his soul he\r\n      was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away.\nThe morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his full\r\n      uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. Hiscalèchewas\r\n      already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in his\r\n      uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed\r\n      peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to his voice\r\n      which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came running up\r\n      the avenue with frightened faces.\nPrincess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and\r\n      into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving\r\n      toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by the armpits\r\n      and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations. She ran\r\n      up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots\r\n      through the shade of the lime-tree avenue, could not be sure what change\r\n      there was in his face. All she could see was that his former stern and\r\n      determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission. On\r\n      seeing his daughter he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound. It\r\n      was impossible to make out what he wanted. He was lifted up, carried to\r\n      his study, and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late.\nThe doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the\r\n      prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.\nIt was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and next\r\n      day they moved the prince to Boguchárovo, the doctor accompanying him.\nBy the time they reached Boguchárovo, Dessalles and the little prince had\r\n      already left for Moscow.\nFor three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house\r\n      Prince Andrew had built at Boguchárovo, ever in the same state, getting\r\n      neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like a distorted\r\n      corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips twitching, and it\r\n      was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him\r\n      or not. One thing was certain—that he was suffering and wished to\r\n      say something. But what it was, no one could tell: it might be some\r\n      caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate to public\r\n      affairs, or possibly to family concerns.\nThe doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to\r\n      physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell her\r\n      something, and the fact that her presence always increased his\r\n      restlessness confirmed her opinion.\nHe was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no hope\r\n      of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do to let\r\n      him die on the road. “Would it not be better if the end did come, the very\r\n      end?” Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly sleeping at\r\n      all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched him not with hope\r\n      of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the\r\n      approach of the end.\nStrange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet there\r\n      it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her\r\n      father’s illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with him\r\n      expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes that\r\n      had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts that had\r\n      not entered her mind for years—thoughts of a life free from the fear\r\n      of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family happiness—floated\r\n      continually in her imagination like temptations of the devil. Thrust them\r\n      aside as she would, questions continually recurred to her as to how she\r\n      would order her life now, afterthat. These were temptations of the devil\r\n      and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the sole weapon againsthimwas\r\n      prayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed an attitude of prayer, looked\r\n      at the icons, repeated the words of a prayer, but she could not pray. She\r\n      felt that a different world had now taken possession of her—the life\r\n      of a world of strenuous and free activity, quite opposed to the spiritual\r\n      world in which till now she had been confined and in which her greatest\r\n      comfort had been prayer. She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly\r\n      cares took possession of her.\nIt was becoming dangerous to remain in Boguchárovo. News of the approach\r\n      of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from\r\n      Boguchárovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.\nThe doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the provincial\r\n      Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary to persuade her\r\n      to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the rural police\r\n      having come to Boguchárovo urged the same thing, saying that the French\r\n      were only some twenty-five miles away, that French proclamations were\r\n      circulating in the villages, and that if the princess did not take her\r\n      father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer for the\r\n      consequences.\nThe princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation\r\n      and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day.\r\n      She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in the\r\n      room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, waking up, she\r\n      heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps of\r\n      Tíkhon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she\r\n      listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder\r\n      than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not sleep and\r\n      several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter but not\r\n      deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw and knew how\r\n      unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him. She had\r\n      noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she sometimes\r\n      involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during the night at\r\n      an unusual hour would irritate him.\nBut never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him.\r\n      She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his found\r\n      an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories\r\n      temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of how\r\n      things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life would be\r\n      ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward morning he\r\n      became quiet and she fell asleep.\nShe woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her\r\n      clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father’s illness. On waking\r\n      she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him groan,\r\n      said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.\n“But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!” she\r\n      cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.\nShe washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In front\r\n      of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed into the\r\n      vehicles.\nIt was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still\r\n      horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts\r\n      before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to\r\n      her.\n“He is a little better today,” said he. “I was looking for\r\n      you. One can make out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer.\r\n      Come in, he is asking for you....”\nPrincess Mary’s heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale\r\n      and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to him,\r\n      feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with those\r\n      dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.\n“Come,” said the doctor.\nPrincess Mary entered her father’s room and went up to his bed. He was\r\n      lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with their\r\n      knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed straight\r\n      before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips motionless. He\r\n      seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face seemed to have\r\n      shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller. Princess Mary went up\r\n      and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers so that she understood\r\n      that he had long been waiting for her to come. He twitched her hand, and\r\n      his brows and lips quivered angrily.\nShe looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When\r\n      she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he calmed\r\n      down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips and\r\n      tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and\r\n      imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.\nStraining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic efforts\r\n      with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty\r\n      repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something, repeating the\r\n      same words several times. She could not understand them, but tried to\r\n      guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered.\n“Mmm...ar...ate...ate...” he repeated several times.\nIt was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought he\r\n      had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated:“Mary, are you\r\n      afraid?”The prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.\n“My mind, my mind aches?”questioned Princess Mary.\nHe made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and began\r\n      pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find the\r\n      right place for it.\n“Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...” he then uttered much more\r\n      clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being understood.\nPrincess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs\r\n      and tears.\nHe moved his hand over her hair.\n“I have been calling you all night...” he brought out.\n“If only I had known...” she said through her tears. “I was afraid to come\r\n      in.”\nHe pressed her hand.\n“Weren’t you asleep?”\n“No, I did not sleep,” said Princess Mary, shaking her head.\nUnconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as he\r\n      did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move with\r\n      difficulty.\n“Dear one... Dearest...” Princess Mary could not quite make out what he\r\n      had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender\r\n      caressing word such as he had never used to her before. “Why didn’t you\r\n      come in?”\n“And I was wishing for his death!” thought Princess Mary.\nHe was silent awhile.\n“Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank\r\n      you!... forgive!... thank you!...” and tears began to flow from his eyes.\r\n      “Call Andrew!” he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression of doubt\r\n      showed itself on his face as he spoke.\nHe himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it\r\n      seemed to Princess Mary.\n“I have a letter from him,” she replied.\nHe glanced at her with timid surprise.\n“Where is he?”\n“He’s with the army, Father, at Smolénsk.”\nHe closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in answer\r\n      to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and\r\n      remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.\n“Yes,” he said, softly and distinctly. “Russia has perished. They’ve\r\n      destroyed her.”\nAnd he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary\r\n      could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.\nAgain he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and\r\n      Tíkhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.\nThen he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could\r\n      understand for a long time, till at last Tíkhon understood and repeated\r\n      it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which\r\n      he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia, or\r\n      Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and so\r\n      she could not guess his words.\n“Put on your white dress. I like it,” was what he said.\nHaving understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor\r\n      taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to\r\n      persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the\r\n      prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the\r\n      Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and\r\n      then he had a second and final stroke.\nPrincess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and\r\n      sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing,\r\n      except passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had\r\n      never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as\r\n      far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had\r\n      planted.\n“Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end\r\n      quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What\r\n      use will peace be when he is no longer here?” Princess Mary murmured,\r\n      pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom\r\n      which heaved with convulsive sobs.\nWhen she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her again to\r\n      the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne—who had remained at\r\n      Boguchárovo and did not wish to leave it—coming toward her with a\r\n      stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who had\r\n      come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt\r\n      departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she led him\r\n      to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then, excusing\r\n      herself, she went to the door of the old prince’s room. The doctor came\r\n      out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.\n“Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!”\nShe returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the\r\n      slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how long\r\n      she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman’s\r\n      footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Dunyásha her maid, who\r\n      was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm on\r\n      seeing her mistress.\n“Please come, Princess... The Prince,” said Dunyásha in a breaking voice.\n“Immediately, I’m coming, I’m coming!” replied the princess hurriedly, not\r\n      giving Dunyásha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to avoid\r\n      seeing the girl she ran toward the house.\n“Princess, it’s God’s will! You must be prepared for everything,” said the\r\n      Marshal, meeting her at the house door.\n“Let me alone; it’s not true!” she cried angrily to him.\nThe doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her father’s\r\n      door. “Why are these people with frightened faces stopping me? I don’t\r\n      want any of them! And what are they doing here?” she thought. She opened\r\n      the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened room startled\r\n      her. In the room were her nurse and other women. They all drew back from\r\n      the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the bed as before, but\r\n      the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess Mary stop short on\r\n      the threshold.\n“No, he’s not dead—it’s impossible!” she told herself and approached\r\n      him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips to\r\n      his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the\r\n      tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was\r\n      replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. “No, he is\r\n      no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and\r\n      hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!” And hiding her\r\n      face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor, who\r\n      held her up.\n\nIn the presence of Tíkhon and the doctor the women washed what had been\r\n      the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not\r\n      stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the legs\r\n      that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform with\r\n      his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table. Heaven\r\n      only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done as if of\r\n      its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his coffin, a pall\r\n      was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of juniper, a printed\r\n      band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a corner of the room\r\n      sat a chanter reading the psalms.\nJust as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the inmates\r\n      of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffin—the\r\n      Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women—and all with fixed and\r\n      frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old prince’s\r\n      cold and stiffened hand."

    "text": "Until Prince Andrew settled in Boguchárovo its owners had always been\r\n      absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from those\r\n      of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress, and disposition.\r\n      They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used to approve of them\r\n      for their endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills to help with the\r\n      harvest. or to dig ponds and ditches, but he disliked them for their\r\n      boorishness.\nPrince Andrew’s last stay at Boguchárovo, when he introduced hospitals and\r\n      schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not softened\r\n      their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits\r\n      of character the old prince called boorishness. Various obscure rumors\r\n      were always current among them: at one time a rumor that they would all be\r\n      enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to which they were all\r\n      to be converted; then of some proclamation of the Tsar’s and of an oath to\r\n      the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that\r\n      freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it), then of\r\n      Peter Fëdorovich’s return to the throne in seven years’ time, when\r\n      everything would be made free and so “simple” that there would be no\r\n      restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and his invasion were\r\n      connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of\r\n      Antichrist, the end of the world, and “pure freedom.”\nIn the vicinity of Boguchárovo were large villages belonging to the crown\r\n      or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased.\r\n      There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very\r\n      few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the peasantry of those\r\n      parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the Russian people, the\r\n      causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries, were more\r\n      clearly and strongly noticeable than among others. One instance, which had\r\n      occurred some twenty years before, was a movement among the peasants to\r\n      emigrate to some unknown “warm rivers.” Hundreds of peasants, among them\r\n      the Boguchárovo folk, suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in\r\n      whole families toward the southeast. As birds migrate to somewhere beyond\r\n      the sea, so these men with their wives and children streamed to the\r\n      southeast, to parts where none of them had ever been. They set off in\r\n      caravans, bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove or walked\r\n      toward the “warm rivers.” Many of them were punished, some sent to\r\n      Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, many returned of their\r\n      own accord, and the movement died down of itself just as it had sprung up,\r\n      without apparent reason. But such undercurrents still existed among the\r\n      people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as\r\n      strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time simply, naturally, and\r\n      forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone living in close touch with these people\r\n      it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing\r\n      an eruption.\nAlpátych, who had reached Boguchárovo shortly before the old prince’s\r\n      death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to what\r\n      was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of forty\r\n      miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be\r\n      devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region round\r\n      Boguchárovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French, received\r\n      leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He\r\n      learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who\r\n      possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been\r\n      away driving a government transport, had returned with news that the\r\n      Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not\r\n      harm them. Alpátych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had\r\n      even brought from the village of Visloúkhovo, which was occupied by the\r\n      French, a proclamation by a French general that no harm would be done to\r\n      the inhabitants, and if they remained they would be paid for anything\r\n      taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had brought from Visloúkhovo\r\n      a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that they were false) paid to\r\n      him in advance for hay.\nMore important still, Alpátych learned that on the morning of the very day\r\n      he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the princess’\r\n      luggage from Boguchárovo, there had been a village meeting at which it had\r\n      been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no time to waste. On\r\n      the fifteenth, the day of the old prince’s death, the Marshal had insisted\r\n      on Princess Mary’s leaving at once, as it was becoming dangerous. He had\r\n      told her that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what\r\n      might happen. On the evening of the day the old prince died the Marshal\r\n      went away, promising to return next day for the funeral. But this he was\r\n      unable to do, for he received tidings that the French had unexpectedly\r\n      advanced, and had barely time to remove his own family and valuables from\r\n      his estate.\nFor some thirty years Boguchárovo had been managed by the village Elder,\r\n      Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive “Drónushka.”\nDron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow\r\n      big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are\r\n      sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as straight\r\n      and strong at sixty as at thirty.\nSoon after the migration to the “warm rivers,” in which he had taken part\r\n      like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of Boguchárovo,\r\n      and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty-three years. The\r\n      peasants feared him more than they did their master. The masters, both the\r\n      old prince and the young, and the steward respected him and jestingly\r\n      called him “the Minister.” During the whole time of his service Dron had\r\n      never been drunk or ill, never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks\r\n      had he shown the least fatigue, and though he could not read he had never\r\n      forgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any\r\n      of the endless cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the\r\n      whole corn crop on any single acre of the Boguchárovo fields.\nAlpátych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his\r\n      Dron on the day of the prince’s funeral and told him to have twelve horses\r\n      got ready for the princess’ carriages and eighteen carts for the things to\r\n      be removed from Boguchárovo. Though the peasants paid quitrent, Alpátych\r\n      thought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order, for\r\n      there were two hundred and thirty households at work in Boguchárovo and\r\n      the peasants were well to do. But on hearing the order Dron lowered his\r\n      eyes and remained silent. Alpátych named certain peasants he knew, from\r\n      whom he told him to take the carts.\nDron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting. Alpátych\r\n      named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses available:\r\n      some horses were carting for the government, others were too weak, and\r\n      others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses could be had\r\n      even for the carriages, much less for the carting.\nAlpátych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model\r\n      village Elder, so Alpátych had not managed the prince’s estates for twenty\r\n      years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest degree\r\n      the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with.\r\n      Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did not\r\n      express his personal views but the general mood of the Boguchárovo\r\n      commune, by which the Elder had already been carried away. But he also\r\n      knew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune,\r\n      must be hesitating between the two camps: the masters’ and the serfs’. He\r\n      noticed this hesitation in Dron’s look and therefore frowned and moved\r\n      closer up to him.\n“Now just listen, Drónushka,” said he. “Don’t talk nonsense to me. His\r\n      excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people\r\n      away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the\r\n      Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you\r\n      hear?”\n“I hear,” Dron answered without lifting his eyes.\nAlpátych was not satisfied with this reply.\n“Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!” he said, shaking his head.\n“The power is in your hands,” Dron rejoined sadly.\n“Eh, Dron, drop it!” Alpátych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his\r\n      bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron’s feet. “I can see\r\n      through you and three yards into the ground under you,” he continued,\r\n      gazing at the floor in front of Dron.\nDron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpátych and again lowered his\r\n      eyes.\n“You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their\r\n      homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for the\r\n      princess’ things. And don’t go to any meeting yourself, do you hear?”\nDron suddenly fell on his knees.\n“Yákov Alpátych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me, for\r\n      Christ’s sake!”\n“Stop that!” cried Alpátych sternly. “I see through you and three yards\r\n      under you,” he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his\r\n      knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had been\r\n      able to retain the old prince’s favor for twenty years had long since\r\n      gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of seeing\r\n      three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.\nDron got up and was about to say something, but Alpátych interrupted him.\n“What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking of,\r\n      eh?”\n“What am I to do with the people?” said Dron. “They’re quite beside\r\n      themselves; I have already told them...”\n“‘Told them,’ I dare say!” said Alpátych. “Are they drinking?” he asked\r\n      abruptly.\n“Quite beside themselves, Yákov Alpátych; they’ve fetched another barrel.”\n“Well, then, listen! I’ll go to the police officer, and you tell them so,\r\n      and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.”\n“I understand.”\nAlpátych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time and\r\n      knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that\r\n      they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive “I understand” from\r\n      Dron, Alpátych contented himself with that, though he not only doubted but\r\n      felt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be\r\n      forthcoming.\nAnd so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the\r\n      village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which\r\n      decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts\r\n      should not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the princess,\r\n      Alpátych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived\r\n      from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for the princess’\r\n      carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities."

    "text": "After her father’s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and\r\n      did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alpátych was\r\n      asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with\r\n      Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been\r\n      lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away\r\n      and begged to be left in peace.\nThe windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She lay on\r\n      the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the leather\r\n      cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused thoughts\r\n      were centered on one subject—the irrevocability of death and her own\r\n      spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had shown\r\n      itself during her father’s illness. She wished to pray but did not dare\r\n      to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God. She lay\r\n      for a long time in that position.\nThe sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays\r\n      shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco\r\n      cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts\r\n      suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up, and\r\n      went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but\r\n      windy evening.\n“Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will\r\n      hinder you,” she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her\r\n      head fall on the window sill.\nSomeone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and\r\n      kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black\r\n      dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed\r\n      her, and immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All\r\n      their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind. But she\r\n      remembered too howhehad changed of late toward Mademoiselle Bourienne\r\n      and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were the\r\n      reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. “Besides, is it\r\n      for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?” she thought.\nPrincess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was\r\n      dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry for her and held\r\n      out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle Bourienne at\r\n      once began crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of the princess’\r\n      sorrow and making herself a partner in it. She said her only consolation\r\n      was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow, that all\r\n      the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief;\r\n      that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone, and thathe, from\r\n      above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess heard her, not\r\n      heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the\r\n      sound of her voice.\n“Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess,” said Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne after a pause. “I understand that you could not, and cannot,\r\n      think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has Alpátych\r\n      been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?” she asked.\nPrincess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or\r\n      where to. “Is it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not all\r\n      the same?” she thought, and did not reply.\n“You know,chère Marie,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, “that\r\n      we are in danger—are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move\r\n      now. If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows...”\nPrincess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was\r\n      talking about.\n“Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,” she said. “Of\r\n      course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... Alpátych did say\r\n      something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing, nothing, and\r\n      don’t want to....”\n“I’ve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow,\r\n      but I think it would now be better to stay here,” said Mademoiselle\r\n      Bourienne. “Because, you will agree,chère Marie, to fall into the\r\n      hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.”\nMademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not printed\r\n      on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau’s, telling people not to\r\n      leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford them proper\r\n      protection. She handed this to the princess.\n“I think it would be best to appeal to that general,” she continued, “and\r\n      I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.”\nPrincess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled\r\n      sobs.\n“From whom did you get this?” she asked.\n“They probably recognized that I am French, by my name,” replied\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.\nPrincess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with a\r\n      pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrew’s\r\n      study.\n“Dunyásha, send Alpátych, or Drónushka, or somebody to me!” she said, “and\r\n      tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,” she added, hearing\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne’s voice. “We must go at once, at once!” she said,\r\n      appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.\n“If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That I, the\r\n      daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkónski, asked General Rameau for protection\r\n      and accepted his favor!” This idea horrified her, made her shudder, blush,\r\n      and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced\r\n      before. All that was distressing, and especially all that was humiliating,\r\n      in her position rose vividly to her mind. “They, the French, would settle\r\n      in this house: M. le Général Rameau would occupy Prince Andrew’s study and\r\n      amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers.\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of Boguchárovo for him. I\r\n      should be given a small room as a favor, the soldiers would violate my\r\n      father’s newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars, they would tell\r\n      me of their victories over the Russians, and would pretend to sympathize\r\n      with my sorrow...” thought Princess Mary, not thinking her own thoughts\r\n      but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother. For herself\r\n      she did not care where she remained or what happened to her, but she felt\r\n      herself the representative of her dead father and of Prince Andrew.\r\n      Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings. What\r\n      they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say\r\n      and do. She went into Prince Andrew’s study, trying to enter completely\r\n      into his ideas, and considered her position.\nThe demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her father’s\r\n      death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force\r\n      and took possession of her.\nAgitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael Ivánovich\r\n      and now for Tíkhon or Dron. Dunyásha, the nurse, and the other maids could\r\n      not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne’s statement was correct.\r\n      Alpátych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither could the\r\n      architect Michael Ivánovich, who on being sent for came in with sleepy\r\n      eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile of agreement\r\n      with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old\r\n      prince without expressing views of his own, he now replied to Princess\r\n      Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his answers. The old\r\n      valet Tíkhon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the stamp of\r\n      inconsolable grief, replied: “Yes, Princess” to all Princess Mary’s\r\n      questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.\nAt length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow to\r\n      Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.\nPrincess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him.\n“Drónushka,” she said, regarding as a sure friend this Drónushka who\r\n      always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the\r\n      fair at Vyázma every year and smilingly offer it to her, “Drónushka, now\r\n      since our misfortune...” she began, but could not go on.\n“We are all in God’s hands,” said he, with a sigh.\nThey were silent for a while.\n“Drónushka, Alpátych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn to.\r\n      Is it true, as they tell me, that I can’t even go away?”\n“Why shouldn’t you go away, your excellency? You can go,” said Dron.\n“I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I can\r\n      do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away tonight\r\n      or early tomorrow morning.”\nDron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: “There are no\r\n      horses; I told Yákov Alpátych so.”\n“Why are there none?” asked the princess.\n“It’s all God’s scourge,” said Dron. “What horses we had have been taken\r\n      for the army or have died—this is such a year! It’s not a case of\r\n      feeding horses—we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go\r\n      three days without eating. We’ve nothing, we’ve been ruined.”\nPrincess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.\n“The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?” she asked.\n“They’re dying of hunger,” said Dron. “It’s not a case of carting.”\n“But why didn’t you tell me, Drónushka? Isn’t it possible to help them?\r\n      I’ll do all I can....”\nTo Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow was\r\n      filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich could\r\n      refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there was such a\r\n      thing as “landlord’s corn” which was sometimes given to the peasants. She\r\n      also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the\r\n      peasants in need, she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about\r\n      the distribution of the grain she wished to give. She was glad such cares\r\n      presented themselves, enabling her without scruple to forget her own\r\n      grief. She began asking Dron about the peasants’ needs and what there was\r\n      in Boguchárovo that belonged to the landlord.\n“But we have grain belonging to my brother?” she said.\n“The landlord’s grain is all safe,” replied Dron proudly. “Our prince did\r\n      not order it to be sold.”\n“Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave in\r\n      my brother’s name,” said she.\nDron made no answer but sighed deeply.\n“Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I give\r\n      this order in my brother’s name; and tell them that what is ours is\r\n      theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.”\nDron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.\n“Discharge me, little mother, for God’s sake! Order the keys to be taken\r\n      from me,” said he. “I have served twenty-three years and have done no\r\n      wrong. Discharge me, for God’s sake!”\nPrincess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was\r\n      asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his\r\n      devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the\r\n      peasants."

    "text": "An hour later Dunyásha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and\r\n      all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess’ order and\r\n      wished to have word with their mistress.\n“But I never told them to come,” said Princess Mary. “I only told Dron to\r\n      let them have the grain.”\n“Only, for God’s sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and don’t go out\r\n      to them. It’s all a trick,” said Dunyásha, “and when Yákov Alpátych\r\n      returns let us get away... and please don’t...”\n“What is a trick?” asked Princess Mary in surprise.\n“I know it is, only listen to me for God’s sake! Ask nurse too. They say\r\n      they don’t agree to leave Boguchárovo as you ordered.”\n“You’re making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,” said\r\n      Princess Mary. “Call Drónushka.”\nDron came and confirmed Dunyásha’s words; the peasants had come by the\r\n      princess’ order.\n“But I never sent for them,” declared the princess. “You must have given\r\n      my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.”\nDron only sighed in reply.\n“If you order it they will go away,” said he.\n“No, no. I’ll go out to them,” said Princess Mary, and in spite of the\r\n      nurse’s and Dunyásha’s protests she went out into the porch; Dron,\r\n      Dunyásha, the nurse, and Michael Ivánovich following her.\n“They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain\r\n      here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the French,”\r\n       thought Princess Mary. “I will offer them monthly rations and housing at\r\n      our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in my place,” she\r\n      thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd standing on the\r\n      pasture by the barn.\nThe men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their hats.\r\n      Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, came close up\r\n      to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed on her, and\r\n      there were so many different faces, that she could not distinguish any of\r\n      them and, feeling that she must speak to them all at once, did not know\r\n      how to do it. But again the sense that she represented her father and her\r\n      brother gave her courage, and she boldly began her speech.\n“I am very glad you have come,” she said without raising her eyes, and\r\n      feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. “Drónushka tells me that\r\n      the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I shall grudge\r\n      nothing to help you. I am myself going away because it is dangerous\r\n      here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving you everything, my\r\n      friends, and I beg you to take everything, all our grain, so that you may\r\n      not suffer want! And if you have been told that I am giving you the grain\r\n      to keep you here—that is not true. On the contrary, I ask you to go\r\n      with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow, and I promise you I\r\n      will see to it that there you shall want for nothing. You shall be given\r\n      food and lodging.”\nThe princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.\n“I am not doing this on my own account,” she continued, “I do it in the\r\n      name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother\r\n      and his son.”\nAgain she paused. No one broke the silence.\n“Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is\r\n      mine is yours,” she concluded, scanning the faces before her.\nAll eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She could\r\n      not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or apprehension\r\n      and distrust—but the expression on all the faces was identical.\n“We are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won’t do for us to take\r\n      the landlord’s grain,” said a voice at the back of the crowd.\n“But why not?” asked the princess.\nNo one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that\r\n      every eye she met now was immediately dropped.\n“But why don’t you want to take it?” she asked again.\nNo one answered.\nThe silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch someone’s\r\n      eye.\n“Why don’t you speak?” she inquired of a very old man who stood just in\r\n      front of her leaning on his stick. “If you think something more is wanted,\r\n      tell me! I will do anything,” said she, catching his eye.\nBut as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:\n“Why should we agree? We don’t want the grain.”\n“Why should we give up everything? We don’t agree. Don’t agree.... We are\r\n      sorry for you, but we’re not willing. Go away yourself, alone...” came\r\n      from various sides of the crowd.\nAnd again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression, though\r\n      now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude, but of\r\n      angry resolve.\n“But you can’t have understood me,” said Princess Mary with a\r\n      sad smile. “Why don’t you want to go? I promise to house and feed\r\n      you, while here the enemy would ruin you....”\nBut her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.\n“We’re not willing. Let them ruin us! We won’t take your grain. We don’t\r\n      agree.”\nAgain Princess Mary tried to catch someone’s eye, but not a single eye in\r\n      the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying to avoid her\r\n      look. She felt strange and awkward.\n“Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses\r\n      and go into bondage! I dare say! ‘I’ll give you grain, indeed!’ she says,”\r\n       voices in the crowd were heard saying.\nWith drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the\r\n      house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her\r\n      departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone with her\r\n      own thoughts."

    "text": "For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her\r\n      room hearing the sound of the peasants’ voices that reached her from the\r\n      village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt that she could\r\n      not understand them however much she might think about them. She thought\r\n      only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused by cares for\r\n      the present, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she could remember\r\n      it and weep or pray.\nAfter sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh. Toward\r\n      midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began\r\n      to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to rise,\r\n      and stillness reigned over the village and the house.\nPictures of the near past—her father’s illness and last moments—rose\r\n      one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered\r\n      over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the picture of\r\n      his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at\r\n      this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures presented\r\n      themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now\r\n      present, now past, and now future.\nShe vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being\r\n      dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills, muttering\r\n      something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray eyebrows and\r\n      looking uneasily and timidly at her.\n“Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,” she\r\n      thought. “He had always thought what he said then.” And she recalled in\r\n      all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke, when\r\n      with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will.\r\n      She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going to the\r\n      door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the\r\n      door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to Tíkhon,\r\n      speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress. Evidently\r\n      he had wanted to talk. “And why didn’t he call me? Why didn’t he let me be\r\n      there instead of Tíkhon?” Princess Mary had thought and thought again now.\r\n      “Now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul. Never will that\r\n      moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to\r\n      say, and not Tíkhon but I might have heard and understood him. Why didn’t\r\n      I enter the room?” she thought. “Perhaps he would then have said to me\r\n      what he said the day he died. While talking to Tíkhon he asked about me\r\n      twice. He wanted to see me, and I was standing close by, outside the door.\r\n      It was sad and painful for him to talk to Tíkhon who did not understand\r\n      him. I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were\r\n      alive—he had forgotten she was dead—and Tíkhon reminded him\r\n      that she was no more, and he shouted, ‘Fool!’ He was greatly depressed.\r\n      From behind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and\r\n      loudly exclaimed, ‘My God!’ Why didn’t I go in then? What could he have\r\n      done to me? What could I have lost? And perhaps he would then have been\r\n      comforted and would have said that word to me.” And Princess Mary uttered\r\n      aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death.\r\n      “Dear-est!” she repeated, and began sobbing, with tears that relieved her\r\n      soul. She now saw his face before her. And not the face she had known ever\r\n      since she could remember and had always seen at a distance, but the timid,\r\n      feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely, with all its\r\n      wrinkles and details, when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he\r\n      said.\n“Dear-est!” she repeated again.\n“What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking now?”\r\n       This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she saw him\r\n      before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his\r\n      coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the horror\r\n      that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself thatthatwas nothe, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her again. She\r\n      tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do neither. With\r\n      wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows, expecting every\r\n      moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the silence brooding over\r\n      the house and within it held her fast.\n“Dunyásha,” she whispered. “Dunyásha!” she screamed wildly, and tearing\r\n      herself out of this silence she ran to the servants’ quarters to meet her\r\n      old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER XIII",
    "text": "On the seventeenth of August Rostóv and Ilyín, accompanied by Lavrúshka\r\n      who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left their\r\n      quarters at Yankóvo, ten miles from Boguchárovo, and went for a ride—to\r\n      try a new horse Ilyín had bought and to find out whether there was any hay\r\n      to be had in the villages.\nFor the last three days Boguchárovo had lain between the two hostile\r\n      armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as\r\n      for the French vanguard; Rostóv, as a careful squadron commander, wished\r\n      to take such provisions as remained at Boguchárovo before the French could\r\n      get them.\nRostóv and Ilyín were in the merriest of moods. On the way to Boguchárovo,\r\n      a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find\r\n      many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned Lavrúshka about\r\n      Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one another to try Ilyín’s\r\n      horse.\nRostóv had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of\r\n      that very Bolkónski who had been engaged to his sister.\nRostóv and Ilyín gave rein to their horses for a last race along the\r\n      incline before reaching Boguchárovo, and Rostóv, outstripping Ilyín, was\r\n      the first to gallop into the village street.\n“You’re first!” cried Ilyín, flushed.\n“Yes, always first both on the grassland and here,” answered Rostóv,\r\n      stroking his heated Donéts horse.\n“And I’d have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,” said Lavrúshka from\r\n      behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, “only I didn’t wish to mortify\r\n      you.”\nThey rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants was\r\n      standing.\nSome of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals\r\n      without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and\r\n      scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and singing\r\n      some incoherent song, and approached the officers.\n“Fine fellows!” said Rostóv laughing. “Is there any hay here?”\n“And how like one another,” said Ilyín.\n“A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!” sang one of the peasants with a\r\n      blissful smile.\nOne of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostóv.\n“Who do you belong to?” he asked.\n“The French,” replied Ilyín jestingly, “and here is Napoleon himself”—and\r\n      he pointed to Lavrúshka.\n“Then you are Russians?” the peasant asked again.\n“And is there a large force of you here?” said another, a short man,\r\n      coming up.\n“Very large,” answered Rostóv. “But why have you collected here?” he\r\n      added. “Is it a holiday?”\n“The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,” replied\r\n      the peasant, moving away.\nAt that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a\r\n      man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.\n“The one in pink is mine, so keep off!” said Ilyín on seeing Dunyásha\r\n      running resolutely toward him.\n“She’ll be ours!” said Lavrúshka to Ilyín, winking.\n“What do you want, my pretty?” said Ilyín with a smile.\n“The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.”\n“This is Count Rostóv, squadron commander, and I am your humble servant.”\n“Co-o-om-pa-ny!” roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he\r\n      looked at Ilyín talking to the girl. Following Dunyásha, Alpátych advanced\r\n      to Rostóv, having bared his head while still at a distance.\n“May I make bold to trouble your honor?” said he respectfully, but with a\r\n      shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand\r\n      thrust into his bosom. “My mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince\r\n      Nicholas Bolkónski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding\r\n      herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people”—he\r\n      pointed to the peasants—“asks you to come up to the house.... Won’t\r\n      you, please, ride on a little farther,” said Alpátych with a melancholy\r\n      smile, “as it is not convenient in the presence of...?” He pointed to the\r\n      two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.\n“Ah!... Alpátych... Ah, Yákov Alpátych... Grand! Forgive us for Christ’s\r\n      sake, eh?” said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.\nRostóv looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.\n“Or perhaps they amuse your honor?” remarked Alpátych with a staid air, as\r\n      he pointed at the old men with his free hand.\n“No, there’s not much to be amused at here,” said Rostóv, and rode on a\r\n      little way. “What’s the matter?” he asked.\n“I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don’t wish\r\n      to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her\r\n      horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her\r\n      excellency cannot get away.”\n“Impossible!” exclaimed Rostóv.\n“I have the honor to report to you the actual truth,” said Alpátych.\nRostóv dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alpátych to\r\n      the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared that\r\n      the princess’ offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and her talk\r\n      with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect that Dron\r\n      had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared\r\n      when Alpátych sent for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave\r\n      orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd\r\n      to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village:\r\n      that there was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the\r\n      horses. Alpátych had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was\r\n      chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing himself in the crowd)\r\n      that they could not let the princess go, that there was an order to the\r\n      contrary, but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey\r\n      her in everything.\nAt the moment when Rostóv and Ilyín were galloping along the road,\r\n      Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpátych, her nurse, and the\r\n      maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the\r\n      cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran\r\n      away, and the women in the house began to wail.\n“Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!” exclaimed deeply moved voices as\r\n      Rostóv passed through the anteroom.\nPrincess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting\r\n      room, when Rostóv was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why he\r\n      had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian face, and\r\n      by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her\r\n      own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began\r\n      speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This meeting\r\n      immediately struck Rostóv as a romantic event. “A helpless girl\r\n      overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And\r\n      what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there are\r\n      in her features and expression!” thought he as he looked at her and\r\n      listened to her timid story.\nWhen she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her\r\n      father’s funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if\r\n      fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at\r\n      him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in Rostóv’s\r\n      eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that\r\n      radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.\n“I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here\r\n      and am able to show my readiness to serve you,” said Rostóv, rising. “Go\r\n      when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to\r\n      cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.” And\r\n      bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward the\r\n      door.\nRostóv’s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider\r\n      himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to take advantage\r\n      of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.\nPrincess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.\n“I am very, very grateful to you,” she said in French, “but I hope it was\r\n      all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.” She suddenly\r\n      began to cry.\n“Excuse me!” she said.\nRostóv, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow."

    "text": "“Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend—my pink one is delicious; her name\r\n      is Dunyásha....”\nBut on glancing at Rostóv’s face Ilyín stopped short. He saw that his hero\r\n      and commander was following quite a different train of thought.\nRostóv glanced angrily at Ilyín and without replying strode off with rapid\r\n      steps to the village.\n“I’ll show them; I’ll give it to them, the brigands!” said he to himself.\nAlpátych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with\r\n      him with difficulty.\n“What decision have you been pleased to come to?” said he.\nRostóv stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on\r\n      Alpátych.\n“Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...” cried he. “What have you been\r\n      about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can’t manage them? You’re a\r\n      traitor yourself! I know you. I’ll flay you all alive!...” And as if\r\n      afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alpátych and went rapidly\r\n      forward. Alpátych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with Rostóv\r\n      at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said the peasants\r\n      were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to\r\n      “overresist” them without an armed force, and would it not be better first\r\n      to send for the military?\n“I’ll give them armed force... I’ll ‘overresist’ them!” uttered Rostóv\r\n      meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent\r\n      it.\nWithout considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick,\r\n      resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more\r\n      Alpátych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results.\r\n      The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw Rostóv’s\r\n      rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.\nAfter the hussars had come to the village and Rostóv had gone to see the\r\n      princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd.\r\n      Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and might\r\n      take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of this\r\n      opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked their\r\n      ex-Elder.\n“How many years have you been fattening on the commune?” Karp shouted at\r\n      him. “It’s all one to you! You’ll dig up your pot of money and take it\r\n      away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined\r\n      or not?”\n“We’ve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes or\r\n      take away a single grain, and that’s all about it!” cried another.\n“It was your son’s turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged your\r\n      lump of a son,” a little old man suddenly began attacking Dron—“and\r\n      so they took my Vánka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to die.”\n“To be sure, we all have to die. I’m not against the commune,” said Dron.\n“That’s it—not against it! You’ve filled your belly....”\nThe two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostóv, followed by Ilyín,\r\n      Lavrúshka, and Alpátych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting his fingers\r\n      into his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front. Dron on the\r\n      contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together.\n“Who is your Elder here? Hey?” shouted Rostóv, coming up to the crowd with\r\n      quick steps.\n“The Elder? What do you want with him?...” asked Karp.\nBut before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a\r\n      fierce blow jerked his head to one side.\n“Caps off, traitors!” shouted Rostóv in a wrathful voice. “Where’s the\r\n      Elder?” he cried furiously.\n“The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakhárych, you!” meek and\r\n      flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come\r\n      off their heads.\n“We don’t riot, we’re following the orders,” declared Karp, and at that\r\n      moment several voices began speaking together.\n“It’s as the old men have decided—there’s too many of you giving\r\n      orders.”\n“Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!” cried Rostóv unmeaningly in a\r\n      voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. “Bind him, bind him!” he\r\n      shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrúshka and Alpátych.\nLavrúshka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from behind.\n“Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?” he called out.\nAlpátych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come\r\n      and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking\r\n      off their belts.\n“Where’s the Elder?” demanded Rostóv in a loud voice.\nWith a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.\n“Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrúshka!” shouted Rostóv, as if that\r\n      order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.\nAnd in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own\r\n      belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.\n“And you all listen to me!” said Rostóv to the peasants. “Be off to your\r\n      houses at once, and don’t let one of your voices be heard!”\n“Why, we’ve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness.\r\n      It’s all nonsense.... I said then that it was not in order,” voices\r\n      were heard bickering with one another.\n“There! What did I say?” said Alpátych, coming into his own\r\n      again. “It’s wrong, lads!”\n“All our stupidity, Yákov Alpátych,” came the answers, and the\r\n      crowd began at once to disperse through the village.\nThe two bound men were led off to the master’s house. The two drunken\r\n      peasants followed them.\n“Aye, when I look at you!...” said one of them to Karp.\n“How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of, you\r\n      fool?” added the other—“A real fool!”\nTwo hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the\r\n      Boguchárovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the proprietor’s\r\n      goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, liberated at Princess\r\n      Mary’s wish from the cupboard where he had been confined, was standing in\r\n      the yard directing the men.\n“Don’t put it in so carelessly,” said one of the peasants, a man with a\r\n      round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. “You know it has\r\n      cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord\r\n      where it’ll get rubbed? I don’t like that way of doing things. Let it all\r\n      be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put it under the bast\r\n      matting and cover it with hay—that’s the way!”\n“Eh, books, books!” said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrew’s\r\n      library cupboards. “Don’t catch up against it! It’s heavy, lads—solid\r\n      books.”\n“Yes, they worked all day and didn’t play!” remarked the tall,\r\n      round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the\r\n      dictionaries that were on the top.\n\nUnwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostóv did not go back to\r\n      the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her\r\n      carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight\r\n      miles from Boguchárovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At\r\n      the inn at Yankóvo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time\r\n      permitting himself to kiss her hand.\n“How can you speak so!” he blushingly replied to Princess Mary’s\r\n      expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had\r\n      occurred. “Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had only\r\n      peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,” said he\r\n      with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. “I am only happy\r\n      to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance. Good-by,\r\n      Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again\r\n      in happier circumstances. If you don’t want to make me blush, please don’t\r\n      thank me!”\nBut the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked him\r\n      with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and\r\n      tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for.\r\n      On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she\r\n      would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the French, and\r\n      that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her,\r\n      and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul,\r\n      able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind, honest eyes,\r\n      with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she\r\n      spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.\nWhen she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her\r\n      eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange\r\n      question presented itself to her: did she love him?\nOn the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess’ position was not a\r\n      cheerful one, Dunyásha, who went with her in the carriage, more than once\r\n      noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something\r\n      with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.\n“Well, supposing I do love him?” thought Princess Mary.\nAshamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love\r\n      with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted herself with\r\n      the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to\r\n      blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she continued to the end\r\n      of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first\r\n      and last time in her life.\nSometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his words,\r\n      happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those moments that\r\n      Dunyásha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window.\n“Was it not fate that brought him to Boguchárovo, and at that very\r\n      moment?” thought Princess Mary. “And that caused his sister to refuse my\r\n      brother?” And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.\nThe impression the princess made on Rostóv was a very agreeable one. To\r\n      remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his\r\n      adventure at Boguchárovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay and\r\n      having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew angry.\r\n      It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle Princess\r\n      Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune, had against\r\n      his will more than once entered his head. For himself personally Nicholas\r\n      could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her he would make the\r\n      countess his mother happy, would be able to put his father’s affairs in\r\n      order, and would even—he felt it—ensure Princess Mary’s\r\n      happiness.\nBut Sónya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostóv grew angry when he\r\n      was rallied about Princess Bolkónskaya."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER XV",
    "text": "On receiving command of the armies Kutúzov remembered Prince Andrew and\r\n      sent an order for him to report at headquarters.\nPrince Andrew arrived at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche on the very day and at the\r\n      very hour that Kutúzov was reviewing the troops for the first time. He\r\n      stopped in the village at the priest’s house in front of which stood the\r\n      commander in chief’s carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate\r\n      awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called Kutúzov. From the\r\n      field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the\r\n      roar of many voices shouting “Hurrah!” to the new commander in chief. Two\r\n      orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces from\r\n      Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kutúzov’s absence and of the fine\r\n      weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick\r\n      mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew,\r\n      inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and whether he\r\n      would soon be back.\nPrince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness’ staff but\r\n      was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart\r\n      orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chief’s\r\n      orderly speaks to officers, replied:\n“What? His Serene Highness? I expect he’ll be here soon. What do you\r\n      want?”\nThe lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the\r\n      orderly’s tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and\r\n      approached Bolkónski with a slight bow. Bolkónski made room for him on the\r\n      bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.\n“You’re also waiting for the commander in chief?” said he. “They say he\r\n      weceives evewyone, thank God!... It’s awful with those sausage eaters!\r\n      Ermólov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now p’waps\r\n      Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what was\r\n      happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in the\r\n      campaign?” he asked.\n“I had the pleasure,” replied Prince Andrew, “not only of taking part in\r\n      the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear—not to\r\n      mention the estate and home of my birth—my father, who died of\r\n      grief. I belong to the province of Smolénsk.”\n“Ah? You’re Pwince Bolkónski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance! I’m\r\n      Lieutenant Colonel Denísov, better known as ‘Váska,’” said Denísov,\r\n      pressing Prince Andrew’s hand and looking into his face with a\r\n      particularly kindly attention. “Yes, I heard,” said he sympathetically,\r\n      and after a short pause added: “Yes, it’s Scythian warfare. It’s all vewy\r\n      well—only not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince\r\n      Andwew Bolkónski?” He swayed his head. “Vewy pleased, Pwince, to make your\r\n      acquaintance!” he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again pressed\r\n      Prince Andrew’s hand.\nPrince Andrew knew Denísov from what Natásha had told him of her first\r\n      suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful\r\n      feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found place\r\n      in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious\r\n      impressions—such as the retreat from Smolénsk, his visit to Bald\r\n      Hills, and the recent news of his father’s death—and had experienced\r\n      so many emotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered\r\n      his mind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their\r\n      former strength. For Denísov, too, the memories awakened by the name of\r\n      Bolkónski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and\r\n      after Natásha’s singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen\r\n      without realizing what he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of that\r\n      time and of his love for Natásha, and passed at once to what now\r\n      interested him passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign\r\n      he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had\r\n      proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to\r\n      Kutúzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line of operation\r\n      was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or concurrently with,\r\n      action on the front to bar the advance of the French, we should attack\r\n      their line of communication. He began explaining his plan to Prince\r\n      Andrew.\n“They can’t hold all that line. It’s impossible. I will undertake to bweak\r\n      thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line, that’s\r\n      certain! There’s only one way—guewilla warfare!”\nDenísov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to\r\n      Bolkónski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the\r\n      army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music and\r\n      songs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of hoofs\r\n      and shouts were nearing the village.\n“He’s coming! He’s coming!” shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.\nBolkónski and Denísov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers (a\r\n      guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutúzov coming down the street\r\n      mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals rode\r\n      behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of officers\r\n      ran after and around them shouting, “Hurrah!”\nHis adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutúzov was impatiently\r\n      urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he raised\r\n      his hand to his white Horse Guard’s cap with a red band and no peak,\r\n      nodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of honor, a\r\n      fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were giving him the\r\n      salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute\r\n      with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of\r\n      generals and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed a subtle\r\n      expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity.\n“And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,\r\n      General,” he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and Denísov.\n“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” shouted those behind him.\nSince Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutúzov had grown still more\r\n      corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the\r\n      familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing\r\n      the white Horse Guard’s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging\r\n      over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on his\r\n      brisk little horse.\n“Whew... whew... whew!” he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard.\r\n      His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to\r\n      rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup and,\r\n      lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort,\r\n      raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee, groaned,\r\n      and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants who stood\r\n      ready to assist him.\nHe pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced at\r\n      Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his waddling\r\n      gait to the porch. “Whew... whew... whew!” he whistled, and again glanced\r\n      at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was only after some\r\n      seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrew’s face linked itself\r\n      up with Kutúzov’s remembrance of his personality.\n“Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come\r\n      along...” said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the porch\r\n      which creaked under his weight.\nHe unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.\n“And how’s your father?”\n“I received news of his death, yesterday,” replied Prince Andrew abruptly.\nKutúzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off\r\n      his cap and crossed himself:\n“May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God’s will be done to us all!” He\r\n      sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. “I\r\n      loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.”\nHe embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some\r\n      time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that\r\n      Kutúzov’s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He\r\n      sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.\n“Come! Come with me, we’ll have a talk,” said he.\nBut at that moment Denísov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by\r\n      the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite the\r\n      angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kutúzov, his hands\r\n      still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. Denísov, having given\r\n      his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene Highness a\r\n      matter of great importance for their country’s welfare. Kutúzov looked\r\n      wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance, folded\r\n      them across his stomach, repeating the words: “For our country’s welfare?\r\n      Well, what is it? Speak!” Denísov blushed like a girl (it was strange to\r\n      see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) and boldly\r\n      began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy’s lines of communication\r\n      between Smolénsk and Vyázma. Denísov came from those parts and knew the\r\n      country well. His plan seemed decidedly a good one, especially from the\r\n      strength of conviction with which he spoke. Kutúzov looked down at his own\r\n      legs, occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if\r\n      expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And from that hut, while\r\n      Denísov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under his arm really did\r\n      appear.\n“What?” said Kutúzov, in the midst of Denísov’s explanations, “are you\r\n      ready so soon?”\n“Ready, your Serene Highness,” replied the general.\nKutúzov swayed his head, as much as to say: “How is one man to deal with\r\n      it all?” and again listened to Denísov.\n“I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,” said Denísov, “that I can\r\n      bweak Napoleon’s line of communication!”\n“What relation are you to Intendant General Kiríl Andréevich Denísov?”\r\n       asked Kutúzov, interrupting him.\n“He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.”\n“Ah, we were friends,” said Kutúzov cheerfully. “All right, all right,\r\n      friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we’ll have a talk.”\nWith a nod to Denísov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers\r\n      Konovnítsyn had brought him.\n“Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?” said the general\r\n      on duty in a discontented voice, “the plans must be examined and several\r\n      papers have to be signed.”\nAn adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness\r\n      within. But Kutúzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was\r\n      disengaged. He made a grimace....\n“No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I’ll look\r\n      at them here,” said he. “Don’t go away,” he added, turning\r\n      to Prince Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general’s report.\nWhile this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman’s\r\n      voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on\r\n      glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome\r\n      woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding a\r\n      dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.\r\n      Kutúzov’s adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of\r\n      the priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene\r\n      Highness bread and salt. “Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness\r\n      with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the\r\n      house.... She’s very pretty,” added the adjutant with a smile. At those\r\n      words Kutúzov looked round. He was listening to the general’s report—which\r\n      consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche—as\r\n      he had listened to Denísov, and seven years previously had listened to the\r\n      discussion at the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only\r\n      because he had ears which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them,\r\n      could not help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general could\r\n      say would surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that would be\r\n      said beforehand, and heard it all only because he had to, as one has to\r\n      listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. All that Denísov had said\r\n      was clever and to the point. What the general was saying was even more\r\n      clever and to the point, but it was evident that Kutúzov despised\r\n      knowledge and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the\r\n      matter—something independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince\r\n      Andrew watched the commander in chief’s face attentively, and the only\r\n      expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the\r\n      meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to\r\n      observe propriety. It was evident that Kutúzov despised cleverness and\r\n      learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denísov, but despised\r\n      them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge—he did\r\n      not try to display any of these—but because of something else. He\r\n      despised them because of his old age and experience of life. The only\r\n      instruction Kutúzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to\r\n      looting by the Russian troops. At the end of the report the general put\r\n      before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from\r\n      army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners\r\n      lodged petitions for compensation.\nAfter hearing the matter, Kutúzov smacked his lips together and shook his\r\n      head.\n“Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my dear\r\n      fellow,” said he, “into the fire with all such things! Let them cut the\r\n      crops and burn wood to their hearts’ content. I don’t order it or allow\r\n      it, but I don’t exact compensation either. One can’t get on without it.\r\n      ‘When wood is chopped the chips will fly.’” He looked at the paper again.\r\n      “Oh, this German precision!” he muttered, shaking his head."

    "text": "“Well, that’s all!” said Kutúzov as he signed the last of the documents,\r\n      and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he\r\n      moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.\nThe priest’s wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after all\r\n      not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long been\r\n      preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to Kutúzov.\nHe screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:\n“Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!”\nHe took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish\r\n      for her. “Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?” he asked, moving to\r\n      the door of the room assigned to him. The priest’s wife smiled, and with\r\n      dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room. The adjutant came\r\n      out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with him. Half an hour\r\n      later Prince Andrew was again called to Kutúzov. He found him reclining in\r\n      an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned overcoat. He had in his hand a\r\n      French book which he closed as Prince Andrew entered, marking the place\r\n      with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the cover that it wasLes Chevaliers du\r\n      Cygneby Madame de Genlis.\n“Well, sit down, sit down here. Let’s have a talk,” said Kutúzov. “It’s\r\n      sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you, a\r\n      second father....”\nPrince Andrew told Kutúzov all he knew of his father’s death, and what he\r\n      had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.\n“What... what they have brought us to!” Kutúzov suddenly cried in an\r\n      agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince\r\n      Andrew’s story the condition Russia was in. “But give me time, give me\r\n      time!” he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this\r\n      agitating conversation, and added: “I sent for you to keep you with me.”\n“I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the\r\n      staff,” replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kutúzov noticed.\nKutúzov glanced inquiringly at him.\n“But above all,” added Prince Andrew, “I have grown used to my regiment,\r\n      am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be\r\n      sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you,\r\n      believe me...”\nA shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutúzov’s podgy\r\n      face. He cut Bolkónski short.\n“I am sorry, for I need you. But you’re right, you’re right! It’s not here\r\n      that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are not. The\r\n      regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers served there\r\n      as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember, yes, I remember\r\n      you with the standard!” said Kutúzov, and a flush of pleasure suffused\r\n      Prince Andrew’s face at this recollection.\nTaking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutúzov offered his cheek to be\r\n      kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man’s eyes.\r\n      Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutúzov’s tears came easily, and that he\r\n      was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show\r\n      sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleasant\r\n      and flattering to him.\n“Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of honor!”\r\n       He paused. “I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to send.” And\r\n      changing the subject, Kutúzov began to speak of the Turkish war and the\r\n      peace that had been concluded. “Yes, I have been much blamed,” he said,\r\n      “both for that war and the peace... but everything came at the right time.Tout vient à point à celui qui sait attendre.* And there were as many\r\n      advisers there as here...” he went on, returning to the subject of\r\n      “advisers” which evidently occupied him. “Ah, those advisers!” said he.\r\n      “If we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey\r\n      and should not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but\r\n      more haste, less speed. Kámenski would have been lost if he had not died.\r\n      He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to\r\n      capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign. For that, not\r\n      storming and attacking butpatience and timeare wanted. Kámenski sent\r\n      soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed these two things and took more\r\n      fortresses than Kámenski and made them Turks eat horseflesh!” He swayed\r\n      his head. “And the French shall too, believe me,” he went on, growing\r\n      warmer and beating his chest, “I’ll make them eat horseflesh!”\r\n      And tears again dimmed his eyes.\n* “Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.”\n“But shan’t we have to accept battle?” remarked Prince Andrew.\n“We shall if everybody wants it; it can’t be helped.... But believe me, my\r\n      dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two:patience and time,\r\n      they will do it all. But the advisersn’entendent pas de cette oreille,\r\n      voilà le mal.* Some want a thing—others don’t. What’s one to do?”\r\n       he asked, evidently expecting an answer. “Well, what do you want us to\r\n      do?” he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look. “I’ll tell\r\n      you what to do,” he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not reply: “I\r\n      will tell you what to do, and what I do.Dans le doute, mon cher,” he\r\n      paused,“abstiens-toi”*(2)—he articulated the French proverb\r\n      deliberately.\n* “Don’t see it that way, that’s the trouble.”\n* (2) “When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.”\n“Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share\r\n      your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince,\r\n      nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come straight\r\n      to me. Good-by, my dear boy.”\nAgain he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter had left\r\n      the room Kutúzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished\r\n      novel,Les Chevaliers du Cygneby Madame de Genlis.\nPrince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that\r\n      interview with Kutúzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the\r\n      general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted.\r\n      The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man—in\r\n      whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions, and in place of an\r\n      intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions) only the capacity\r\n      calmly to contemplate the course of events—the more reassured he was\r\n      that everything would be as it should. “He will not bring in any plan of\r\n      his own. He will not devise or undertake anything,” thought Prince Andrew,\r\n      “but he will hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in\r\n      its place. He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful.\r\n      He understands that there is something stronger and more important than\r\n      his own will—the inevitable course of events, and he can see them\r\n      and grasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain\r\n      from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else.\r\n      And above all,” thought Prince Andrew, “one believes in him because he’s\r\n      Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because\r\n      his voice shook when he said: ‘What they have brought us to!’ and had a\r\n      sob in it when he said he would ‘make them eat horseflesh!’”\nOn such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and\r\n      general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the\r\n      popular choice of Kutúzov as commander in chief was received."

    "text": "After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual\r\n      course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember\r\n      the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe that\r\n      Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English Club were\r\n      also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it. The one\r\n      thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the\r\n      Emperor’s stay was the call for contributions of men and money, a\r\n      necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal,\r\n      official form and became unavoidable.\nWith the enemy’s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites’ view of their\r\n      situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more\r\n      frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger\r\n      approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that\r\n      speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a man\r\n      to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it; the\r\n      other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and painful\r\n      to think of the danger, since it is not in man’s power to foresee\r\n      everything and avert the general course of events, and it is therefore\r\n      better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to think about what\r\n      is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to the first voice, but\r\n      in society to the second. So it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow. It\r\n      was long since people had been as gay in Moscow as that year.\nRostopchín’s broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman,\r\n      and a Moscow burgher called Karpúshka Chigírin,“who—having been a\r\n      militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub—heard that\r\n      Napoleon wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the French in very\r\n      bad language, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the\r\n      eagle, began to address the assembled people,”were read and discussed,\r\n      together with the latest of Vasíli Lvóvich Púshkin’sbouts rimés.\nIn the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these\r\n      broadsheets, and some liked the way Karpúshka jeered at the French,\r\n      saying:“They will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our buckwheat\r\n      porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all dwarfs and\r\n      one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.”Others did not\r\n      like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was said that\r\n      Rostopchín had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners from Moscow,\r\n      and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon among them; but\r\n      this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopchín’s witty remark on that\r\n      occasion. The foreigners were deported to Nízhni by boat, and Rostopchín\r\n      had said to them in French:“Rentrez en vous-mêmes; entrez dans la barque,\r\n      et n’en faites pas une barque de Charon.”* There was talk of all\r\n      the government offices having been already removed from Moscow, and to this\r\n      Shinshín’s witticism was added—that for that alone Moscow ought to\r\n      be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mamónov’s regiment would cost\r\n      him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bezúkhov had spent even more\r\n      on his, but that the best thing about Bezúkhov’s action was that he\r\n      himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his regiment\r\n      without charging anything for the show.\n* “Think it over; get into the barque, and take care not to\r\n     make it a barque of Charon.”\n“You don’t spare anyone,” said Julie Drubetskáya as she collected\r\n      and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed fingers.\nJulie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell\r\n      soiree.\n“Bezúkhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What pleasure\r\n      is there to be socaustique?”\n“A forfeit!” cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called“mon\r\n      chevalier,”and who was going with her to Nízhni.\nIn Julie’s set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed\r\n      that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a slip\r\n      and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary\r\n      Contributions.\n“Another forfeit for a Gallicism,” said a Russian writer who was present.\r\n      “‘What pleasure is there to be’ is not Russian!”\n“You spare no one,” continued Julie to the young man without heeding the\r\n      author’s remark.\n“Forcaustique—I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay\r\n      again for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I won’t be\r\n      responsible,” she remarked, turning to the author: “I have neither the\r\n      money nor the time, like Prince Galítsyn, to engage a master to teach me\r\n      Russian!”\n“Ah, here he is!” she added. “Quand on... No, no,” she said to the militia\r\n      officer, “you won’t catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its rays!” and\r\n      she smiled amiably at Pierre. “We were just talking of you,” she said with\r\n      the facility in lying natural to a society woman. “We were saying that\r\n      your regiment would be sure to be better than Mamónov’s.”\n“Oh, don’t talk to me of my regiment,” replied Pierre, kissing his\r\n      hostess’ hand and taking a seat beside her. “I am so sick of it.”\n“You will, of course, command it yourself?” said Julie, directing a sly,\r\n      sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.\nThe latter in Pierre’s presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face\r\n      expressed perplexity as to what Julie’s smile might mean. In spite of his\r\n      absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre’s personality immediately\r\n      checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.\n“No,” said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. “I\r\n      should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I should\r\n      hardly be able to climb onto a horse.”\nAmong those whom Julie’s guests happened to choose to gossip about were\r\n      the Rostóvs.\n“I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,” said Julie. “And he is\r\n      so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The Razumóvskis wanted to buy\r\n      his house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He asks too\r\n      much.”\n“No, I think the sale will come off in a few days,” said someone. “Though\r\n      it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.”\n“Why?” asked Julie. “You don’t think Moscow is in danger?”\n“Then why are you leaving?”\n“I? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is\r\n      going: and besides—I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.”\n“Well, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.”\n“If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his\r\n      debts,” said the militia officer, speaking of Rostóv.\n“A kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so long in\r\n      Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite\r\n      well again now, isn’t she?” Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.\n“They are waiting for their younger son,” Pierre replied. “He joined\r\n      Obolénski’s Cossacks and went to Bélaya Tsérkov where the regiment is\r\n      being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are\r\n      expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the\r\n      countess won’t on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.”\n“I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkhárovs’. Natalie has\r\n      recovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily some\r\n      people get over everything!”\n“Get over what?” inquired Pierre, looking displeased.\nJulie smiled.\n“You know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de Souza’s\r\n      novels.”\n“What knights? What do you mean?” demanded Pierre, blushing.\n“Oh, come, my dear count!C’est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous admire,\r\n      ma parole d’honneur!”*\n* “It is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!”\n“Forfeit, forfeit!” cried the militia officer.\n“All right, one can’t talk—how tiresome!”\n“What is ‘the talk of all Moscow’?” Pierre asked angrily, rising to his\r\n      feet.\n“Come now, Count, you know!”\n“I don’t know anything about it,” said Pierre.\n“I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more\r\n      friendly with Véra—that dear Véra.”\n“No, madame!” Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, “I have not taken\r\n      on myself the role of Natalie Rostóva’s knight at all, and have not been\r\n      to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the cruelty...”\n“Qui s’excuse s’accuse,”* said Julie, smiling and waving the lint\r\n      triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject.\r\n      “Do you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolkónskaya arrived in Moscow\r\n      yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?”\n* “Who excuses himself, accuses himself.”\n“Really? Where is she? I should like very much to see her,” said Pierre.\n“I spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their estate near\r\n      Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.”\n“Well, and how is she?” asked Pierre.\n“She is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a\r\n      romance. Nicholas Rostóv! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill her\r\n      and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her....”\n“Another romance,” said the militia officer. “Really, this general flight\r\n      has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche is one and\r\n      Princess Bolkónskaya another.”\n“Do you know, I really believe she isun petit peu amoureuse du jeune\r\n      homme.” *\n* “A little bit in love with the young man.”\n“Forfeit, forfeit, forfeit!”\n“But how could one say that in Russian?”"

    "text": "When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchín’s broadsheets\r\n      that had been brought that day.\nThe first declared that the report that Count Rostopchín had forbidden\r\n      people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that ladies\r\n      and tradesmen’s wives were leaving the city. “There will be less panic and\r\n      less gossip,” ran the broadsheet “but I will stake my life on it that\r\n      that scoundrel will not enter Moscow.” These words showed Pierre clearly for\r\n      the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The second broadsheet\r\n      stated that our headquarters were at Vyázma, that Count Wittgenstein had\r\n      defeated the French, but that as many of the inhabitants of Moscow wished\r\n      to be armed, weapons were ready for them at the arsenal: sabers, pistols,\r\n      and muskets which could be had at a low price. The tone of the\r\n      proclamation was not as jocose as in the former Chigírin talks. Pierre\r\n      pondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had\r\n      desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused\r\n      involuntary horror in him was drawing near.\n“Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?” he asked himself\r\n      for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table and\r\n      began to lay them out for a game of patience.\n“If this patience comes out,” he said to himself after shuffling the\r\n      cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, “if it comes out,\r\n      it means... what does it mean?”\nHe had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the\r\n      eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.\n“Then it will mean that I must go to the army,” said Pierre to himself.\r\n      “Come in, come in!” he added to the princess.\nOnly the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist, was\r\n      still living in Pierre’s house. The two younger ones had both married.\n“Excuse my coming to you, cousin,” she said in a reproachful and agitated\r\n      voice. “You know some decision must be come to. What is going to happen?\r\n      Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is it that we are\r\n      staying on?”\n“On the contrary, things seem satisfactory,ma cousine,” said\r\n      Pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling\r\n      uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.\n“Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivánovna told me today\r\n      how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them\r\n      credit! And the people too are quite mutinous—they no longer obey,\r\n      even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin\r\n      beating us. One can’t walk in the streets. But, above all, the French will\r\n      be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one thing of\r\n      you, cousin,” she went on, “arrange for me to be taken to Petersburg.\r\n      Whatever I may be, I can’t live under Bonaparte’s rule.”\n“Oh, come,ma cousine!Where do you get your information from? On the\r\n      contrary...”\n“I won’t submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you\r\n      don’t want to do this...”\n“But I will, I’ll give the order at once.”\nThe princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with.\r\n      Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.\n“But you have been misinformed,” said Pierre. “Everything is quiet in the\r\n      city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I’ve just been\r\n      reading...” He showed her the broadsheet. “Count Rostopchín writes that he\r\n      will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.”\n“Oh, that count of yours!” said the princess malevolently. “He is a\r\n      hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didn’t he\r\n      write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, ‘whoever it might be,\r\n      should be dragged to the lockup by his hair’? (How silly!) ‘And honor and\r\n      glory to whoever captures him,’ he says. This is what his cajolery has\r\n      brought us to! Barbara Ivánovna told me the mob near killed her because\r\n      she said something in French.”\n“Oh, but it’s so... You take everything so to heart,” said Pierre, and\r\n      began laying out his cards for patience.\nAlthough that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army, but\r\n      remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,\r\n      irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting something\r\n      terrible.\nNext day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre’s head steward\r\n      came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment\r\n      could not be found without selling one of the estates. In general the head\r\n      steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising a regiment would\r\n      ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to repress a smile.\n“Well then, sell it,” said he. “What’s to be done? I can’t draw back now!”\nThe worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better was\r\n      Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he\r\n      expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie\r\n      had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the\r\n      Rostóvs remained, but he did not go to see them.\nTo distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Vorontsóvo to\r\n      see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe, and a\r\n      trial balloon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet ready,\r\n      but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor’s desire.\r\n      The Emperor had written to Count Rostopchín as follows:\nAs soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and\r\n      intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutúzov to let\r\n      him know. I have informed him of the matter.\nPlease impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for the\r\n      first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy’s\r\n      hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the\r\n      commander in chief.\n\nOn his way home from Vorontsóvo, as he was passing the Bolótnoe Place\r\n      Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lóbnoe Place, stopped and got out\r\n      of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The\r\n      flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the\r\n      flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and a\r\n      green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and pale,\r\n      stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With a\r\n      frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchman’s\r\n      face, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.\n“What is it? Who is it? What is it for?” he kept asking.\nBut the attention of the crowd—officials, burghers, shopkeepers,\r\n      peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses—was so eagerly\r\n      centered on what was passing in Lóbnoe Place that no one answered him. The\r\n      stout man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to\r\n      appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but\r\n      suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded\r\n      grown-up men cry, though angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd\r\n      people began talking loudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed\r\n      to Pierre.\n“He’s cook to some prince.”\n“Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his\r\n      teeth on edge!” said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre, when\r\n      the Frenchman began to cry.\nThe clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be\r\n      appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in\r\n      dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.\nPierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back to\r\n      his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his seat. As\r\n      they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that\r\n      the coachman asked him:\n“What is your pleasure?”\n“Where are you going?” shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to\r\n      Lubyánka Street.\n“To the Governor’s, as you ordered,” answered the coachman.\n“Fool! Idiot!” shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman—a thing he\r\n      rarely did. “Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!” “I must get\r\n      away this very day,” he murmured to himself.\nAt the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the\r\n      Lóbnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no\r\n      longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it\r\n      seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man\r\n      ought to have known it for himself.\nOn reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstáfey—his head coachman\r\n      who knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow—that\r\n      he would leave that night for the army at Mozháysk, and that his saddle\r\n      horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged that day, so\r\n      on Evstáfey’s representation Pierre had to put off his departure till next\r\n      day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.\nOn the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and\r\n      after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night in\r\n      Perkhúshkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that evening.\r\n      (This was the battle of Shevárdino.) He was told that there in\r\n      Perkhúshkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer\r\n      his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching\r\n      Mozháysk.\nEvery house in Mozháysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel\r\n      where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be\r\n      had. It was full of officers.\nEverywhere in Mozháysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the\r\n      march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon\r\n      were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the\r\n      farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of\r\n      troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful\r\n      feeling he had not experienced before. It was a feeling akin to what he\r\n      had felt at the Slobóda Palace during the Emperor’s visit—a sense of\r\n      the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something. He now\r\n      experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes men’s\r\n      happiness—the comforts of life, wealth, even life itself—is\r\n      rubbish it is pleasant to throw away, compared with something... With\r\n      what? Pierre could not say, and he did not try to determine for whom and\r\n      for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything. He was\r\n      not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for; the fact of\r\n      sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation."

    "text": "On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevárdino Redoubt was\r\n      fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on\r\n      the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodinó itself took place.\nWhy and how were the battles of Shevárdino and Borodinó given and\r\n      accepted? Why was the battle of Borodinó fought? There was not the least\r\n      sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result\r\n      for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer to\r\n      the destruction of Moscow—which we feared more than anything in the\r\n      world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were brought\r\n      nearer to the destruction of their whole army—which they feared more\r\n      than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite obvious, and\r\n      yet Napoleon offered and Kutúzov accepted that battle.\nIf the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must\r\n      have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and\r\n      giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army, he was\r\n      advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally clear to\r\n      Kutúzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his\r\n      army he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kutúzov this was mathematically\r\n      clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one man less and go\r\n      on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore should not exchange.\r\n      When my opponent has sixteen men and I have fourteen, I am only one eighth\r\n      weaker than he, but when I have exchanged thirteen more men he will be\r\n      three times as strong as I am.\nBefore the battle of Borodinó our strength in proportion to the French was\r\n      about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than one to\r\n      two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty\r\n      thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred\r\n      thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced Kutúzov accepted the battle,\r\n      while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius, gave it, losing\r\n      a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still\r\n      more. If it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying\r\n      Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, there is\r\n      much evidence to the contrary. Napoleon’s historians themselves tell us\r\n      that from Smolénsk onwards he wished to stop, knew the danger of his\r\n      extended position, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be the\r\n      end of the campaign, for he had seen at Smolénsk the state in which\r\n      Russian towns were left to him, and had not received a single reply to his\r\n      repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate.\nIn giving and accepting battle at Borodinó, Kutúzov acted involuntarily\r\n      and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians\r\n      provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the\r\n      generals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and\r\n      involuntary.\nThe ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish\r\n      the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom\r\n      ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are\r\n      meaningless.\nOn the other question, how the battle of Borodinó and the preceding battle\r\n      of Shevárdino were fought, there also exists a definite and well-known,\r\n      but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the affair as\r\n      follows:\nThe Russian army,they say,in its retreat from Smolénsk sought out for\r\n      itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a\r\n      position at Borodinó.\nThe Russians,they say,fortified this position in advance on the left of\r\n      the highroad (from Moscow to Smolénsk) and almost at a right angle to it,\r\n      from Borodinó to Utítsa, at the very place where the battle was fought.\nIn front of this position,they say,a fortified outpost was set up on the\r\n      Shevárdino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth,we are told,Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the\r\n      twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on\r\n      the field of Borodinó.\nSo the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to\r\n      look into the matter can easily convince himself.\nThe Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,\r\n      during the retreat passed many positions better than Borodinó. They did\r\n      not stop at any one of these positions because Kutúzov did not wish to\r\n      occupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand\r\n      for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because\r\n      Milorádovich had not yet arrived with the militia, and for many other\r\n      reasons. The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger,\r\n      and that the position at Borodinó (the one where the battle was fought),\r\n      far from being strong, was no more apositionthan any other spot one\r\n      might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard.\nNot only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of\r\n      Borodinó to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that is,\r\n      the position on which the battle took place), but never till the\r\n      twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be fought\r\n      there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments\r\n      there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty-fifth and\r\n      twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the position of the\r\n      Shevárdino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless in front of the\r\n      position where the battle was accepted. Why was it more strongly fortified\r\n      than any other post? And why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand\r\n      men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty-fourth? A\r\n      Cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof\r\n      that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and\r\n      that the Shevárdino Redoubt was not an advanced post of that position, we\r\n      have the fact that up to the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagratión\r\n      were convinced that the Shevárdino Redoubt was theleft flankof the\r\n      position, and that Kutúzov himself in his report, written in hot haste\r\n      after the battle, speaks of the Shevárdino Redoubt as theleft flankof\r\n      the position. It was much later, when reports on the battle of Borodinó\r\n      were written at leisure, that the incorrect and extraordinary statement\r\n      was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who\r\n      had to be represented as infallible) that the Shevárdino Redoubt was anadvancedpost—whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on\r\n      the left flank—and that the battle of Borodinó was fought by us on\r\n      an entrenched position previously selected, whereas it was fought on a\r\n      quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched.\nThe case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river\r\n      Kolochá—which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an\r\n      acute angle—so that the left flank was at Shevárdino, the right\r\n      flank near the village of Nóvoe, and the center at Borodinó at the\r\n      confluence of the rivers Kolochá and Vóyna.\nTo anyone who looks at the field of Borodinó without thinking of how the\r\n      battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river Kolochá,\r\n      presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an\r\n      enemy from advancing along the Smolénsk road to Moscow.\nNapoleon, riding to Valúevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the\r\n      history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utítsa to\r\n      Borodinó (he could not have seen that position because it did not exist),\r\n      nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while pursuing\r\n      the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the Russian position—at\r\n      the Shevárdino Redoubt—and unexpectedly for the Russians moved his\r\n      army across the Kolochá. And the Russians, not having time to begin a\r\n      general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the position they had\r\n      intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen\r\n      and was not fortified. By crossing to the other side of the Kolochá to the\r\n      left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from\r\n      right to left (looking from the Russian side) and transferred it to the\r\n      plain between Utítsa, Semënovsk, and Borodinó—a plain no more\r\n      advantageous as a position than any other plain in Russia—and there\r\n      the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took place.\nHad Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the\r\n      Kolochá, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt\r\n      but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that the\r\n      Shevárdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the battle\r\n      would have taken place where we expected it. In that case we should\r\n      probably have defended the Shevárdino Redoubt—our left flank—still\r\n      more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the center or on the\r\n      right, and the engagement would have taken place on the twenty-fifth, in\r\n      the position we intended and had fortified. But as the attack on our left\r\n      flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard (that\r\n      is, immediately after the fight at Gridnëva), and as the Russian\r\n      commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a general\r\n      engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first and chief\r\n      action of the battle of Borodinó was already lost on the twenty-fourth,\r\n      and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twenty-sixth.\nAfter the loss of the Shevárdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the\r\n      morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and\r\n      were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to\r\n      be.\nNot only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,\r\n      unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was\r\n      increased by the fact that the Russian commanders—not having fully\r\n      realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left\r\n      flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from\r\n      right to left—maintained their extended position from the village of\r\n      Nóvoe to Utítsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to\r\n      left during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle\r\n      the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left\r\n      flank with but half as many men. (Poniatowski’s action against Utítsa, and\r\n      Uvárov’s on the right flank against the French, were actions distinct from\r\n      the main course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodinó did not take\r\n      place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders’ mistakes even at\r\n      the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it\r\n      has been described. The battle of Borodinó was not fought on a chosen and\r\n      entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the\r\n      enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the Shevárdino Redoubt, the\r\n      Russians fought the battle of Borodinó on an open and almost unentrenched\r\n      position, with forces only half as numerous as the French; that is to say,\r\n      under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten\r\n      hours and secure an indecisive result, but unthinkable to keep an army\r\n      even from complete disintegration and flight."

    "text": "On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozháysk. At the\r\n      descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the\r\n      town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and\r\n      the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on\r\n      foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by\r\n      its singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who\r\n      had been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers,\r\n      shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The\r\n      carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or\r\n      sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline\r\n      to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with rags, with\r\n      pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of\r\n      the carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost all of them\r\n      stared with naïve, childlike curiosity at Pierre’s white hat and green\r\n      swallow-tail coat.\nPierre’s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one\r\n      side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill with its\r\n      singers, surrounded Pierre’s carriage and blocked the road. Pierre\r\n      stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road\r\n      ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting\r\n      and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierre’s head was the bright\r\n      August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the carts with\r\n      wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The driver in his\r\n      bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one of its tireless\r\n      hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his little horse.\nOne of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following\r\n      the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look\r\n      at Pierre.\n“I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to\r\n      Moscow?” he asked.\nPierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was\r\n      looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded,\r\n      now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men were\r\n      sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had\r\n      probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags and\r\n      one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby’s head. His nose and mouth\r\n      were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the cathedral and\r\n      crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired recruit as white as\r\n      though there was no blood in his thin face, looked at Pierre kindly, with\r\n      a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his face was not visible. The\r\n      cavalry singers were passing close by:\nAh lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,Living in a foreign land...\nthey sang their soldiers’ dance song.\nAs if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the\r\n      metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of\r\n      the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of\r\n      merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the\r\n      panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.\nThe soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers.\n“Oh, the coxcombs!” he muttered reproachfully.\n“It’s not the soldiers only, but I’ve seen peasants today, too.... The\r\n      peasants—even they have to go,” said the soldier behind the cart,\r\n      addressing Pierre with a sad smile. “No distinctions made nowadays....\r\n      They want the whole nation to fall on them—in a word, it’s Moscow!\r\n      They want to make an end of it.”\nIn spite of the obscurity of the soldier’s words Pierre understood what he\r\n      wanted to say and nodded approval.\nThe road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.\nHe kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only\r\n      saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different\r\n      branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white hat\r\n      and green tail coat.\nHaving gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and eagerly\r\n      addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was driving\r\n      toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon, and on\r\n      recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driver’s seat to\r\n      pull up.\n“Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?” asked the doctor.\n“Well, you know, I wanted to see...”\n“Yes, yes, there will be something to see....”\nPierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of\r\n      taking part in a battle.\nThe doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutúzov.\n“Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?” he\r\n      said, exchanging glances with his young companion. “Anyhow his Serene\r\n      Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That’s what you must\r\n      do.”\nThe doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.\n“You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is\r\n      exactly?” said Pierre.\n“The position?” repeated the doctor. “Well, that’s not my line. Drive past\r\n      Tatárinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock and\r\n      you’ll see.”\n“Can one see from there?... If you would...”\nBut the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.\n“I would go with you but on my honor I’m up to here”—and he pointed\r\n      to his throat. “I’m galloping to the commander of the corps. How do\r\n      matters stand?... You know, Count, there’ll be a battle tomorrow. Out of\r\n      an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand\r\n      wounded, and we haven’t stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors\r\n      enough for six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we need other\r\n      things as well—we must manage as best we can!”\nThe strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who had\r\n      stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had\r\n      noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death\r\n      amazed Pierre.\n“They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?” And\r\n      by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozháysk hill, the\r\n      carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the sun,\r\n      and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.\n“The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment\r\n      think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. Yet from\r\n      among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my\r\n      hat! Strange!” thought Pierre, continuing his way to Tatárinova.\nIn front of a landowner’s house to the left of the road stood carriages,\r\n      wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The commander in chief was\r\n      putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and hardly\r\n      any of the staff were there—they had gone to the church service.\r\n      Pierre drove on toward Górki.\nWhen he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he\r\n      saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with\r\n      crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and\r\n      perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right\r\n      of the road.\nSome of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along\r\n      planks, while others stood about doing nothing.\nTwo officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing\r\n      these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their\r\n      position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at\r\n      Mozháysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: “They\r\n      want the whole nation to fall on them.” The sight of these bearded\r\n      peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots and\r\n      perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward the\r\n      middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed Pierre\r\n      more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than\r\n      anything he had yet seen or heard."

    "text": "Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen,\r\n      ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield\r\n      could be seen.\nIt was about eleven o’clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and behind\r\n      him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like an\r\n      amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.\nFrom above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the Smolénsk\r\n      highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five hundred\r\n      paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was Borodinó. Below the\r\n      village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding down and up,\r\n      rose higher and higher to the village of Valúevo visible about four miles\r\n      away, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond Valúevo the road\r\n      disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in the distance in\r\n      that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the cross and belfry\r\n      of the Kolochá Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and there over the whole\r\n      of that blue expanse, to right and left of the forest and the road,\r\n      smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops—ours\r\n      and the enemy’s. The ground to the right—along the course of the\r\n      Kolochá and Moskvá rivers—was broken and hilly. Between the hollows\r\n      the villages of Bezúbova and Zakhárino showed in the distance. On the left\r\n      the ground was more level; there were fields of grain, and the smoking\r\n      ruins of Semënovsk, which had been burned down, could be seen.\nAll that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right\r\n      side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere could he see\r\n      the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields, meadows, troops,\r\n      woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and streams; and try as\r\n      he would he could descry no military “position” in this place which teemed\r\n      with life, nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemy’s.\n“I must ask someone who knows,” he thought, and addressed an officer who\r\n      was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.\n“May I ask you,” said Pierre, “what village that is in front?”\n“Búrdino, isn’t it?” said the officer, turning to his companion.\n“Borodinó,” the other corrected him.\nThe officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to\r\n      Pierre.\n“Are those our men there?” Pierre inquired.\n“Yes, and there, further on, are the French,” said the officer. “There\r\n      they are, there... you can see them.”\n“Where? Where?” asked Pierre.\n“One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!”\nThe officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond\r\n      the river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre had\r\n      noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.\n“Ah, those are the French! And over there?...” Pierre pointed to a knoll\r\n      on the left, near which some troops could be seen.\n“Those are ours.”\n“Ah, ours! And there?...” Pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance\r\n      with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow where also some\r\n      campfires were smoking and something black was visible.\n“That’shisagain,” said the officer. (It was the Shevárdino Redoubt.) “It\r\n      was ours yesterday, but now it ishis.”\n“Then how about our position?”\n“Our position?” replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. “I can\r\n      tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our\r\n      entrenchments. There, you see? There’s our center, at Borodinó, just\r\n      there,” and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white\r\n      church. “That’s where one crosses the Kolochá. You see down there where\r\n      the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there’s the bridge. That’s our\r\n      center. Our right flank is over there”—he pointed sharply to the\r\n      right, far away in the broken ground—“That’s where the Moskvá River\r\n      is, and we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones. The left\r\n      flank...” here the officer paused. “Well, you see, that’s difficult to\r\n      explain.... Yesterday our left flank was there at Shevárdino, you see,\r\n      where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wing—now it is\r\n      over there, do you see that village and the smoke? That’s Semënovsk, yes,\r\n      there,” he pointed to Raévski’s knoll. “But the battle will hardly be\r\n      there.Hishaving moved his troops there is only a ruse;hewill probably\r\n      pass round to the right of the Moskvá. But wherever it may be, many a man\r\n      will be missing tomorrow!” he remarked.\nAn elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving\r\n      these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking, but\r\n      at this point, evidently not liking the officer’s remark, interrupted him.\n“Gabions must be sent for,” said he sternly.\nThe officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might think\r\n      of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak of it.\n“Well, send number three company again,” the officer replied hurriedly.\n“And you, are you one of the doctors?”\n“No, I’ve come on my own,” answered Pierre, and he went down the hill\r\n      again, passing the militiamen.\n“Oh, those damned fellows!” muttered the officer who followed him, holding\r\n      his nose as he ran past the men at work.\n“There they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They’ll be\r\n      here in a minute...” voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers,\r\n      soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.\nA church procession was coming up the hill from Borodinó. First along the\r\n      dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms reversed.\r\n      From behind them came the sound of church singing.\nSoldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the procession.\n“They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of God!”\r\n       someone cried.\n“The Smolénsk Mother of God,” another corrected him.\nThe militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who had\r\n      been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the\r\n      church procession. Following the battalion that marched along the dusty\r\n      road came priests in their vestments—one little old man in a hood\r\n      with attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a\r\n      large, dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon\r\n      that had been brought from Smolénsk and had since accompanied the army.\r\n      Behind, before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads\r\n      walked, ran, and bowed to the ground.\nAt the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had been\r\n      holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others,\r\n      the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot rays of the\r\n      sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the\r\n      bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon. The singing did not\r\n      sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd of bareheaded officers,\r\n      soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon. Behind the priest and a\r\n      chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for them. A bald general\r\n      with a St. George’s Cross on his neck stood just behind the priest’s back,\r\n      and without crossing himself (he was evidently a German) patiently awaited\r\n      the end of the service, which he considered it necessary to hear to the\r\n      end, probably to arouse the patriotism of the Russian people. Another\r\n      general stood in a martial pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in\r\n      front of his chest while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of\r\n      peasants, Pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables,\r\n      but did not look at them—his whole attention was absorbed in\r\n      watching the serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and\r\n      militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired\r\n      chanters, who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day,\r\n      began lazily and mechanically to sing: “Save from calamity Thy servants, O\r\n      Mother of God,” and the priest and deacon chimed in: “For to Thee under\r\n      God we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,” there again\r\n      kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the\r\n      solemnity of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the\r\n      foot of the hill at Mozháysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had\r\n      met that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed\r\n      back, and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were\r\n      heard.\nThe crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.\r\n      Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way\r\n      was made for him, was approaching the icon.\nIt was Kutúzov, who had been riding round the position and on his way back\r\n      to Tatárinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre\r\n      recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him\r\n      from everybody else.\nWith a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body, with\r\n      uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he\r\n      had lost, Kutúzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into the crowd and\r\n      stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an accustomed movement,\r\n      bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and bowed his white head\r\n      with a deep sigh. Behind Kutúzov was Bennigsen and the suite. Despite the\r\n      presence of the commander in chief, who attracted the attention of all the\r\n      superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers\r\n      without looking at him.\nWhen the service was over, Kutúzov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily to\r\n      his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to rise,\r\n      but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His white head\r\n      twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as a child does\r\n      with naïvely pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched the ground with\r\n      his hand. The other generals followed his example, then the officers, and\r\n      after them with excited faces, pressing on one another, crowding, panting,\r\n      and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and militiamen."

    "text": "Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.\n“Count Peter Kirílovich! How did you get here?” said a voice.\nPierre looked round. Borís Drubetskóy, brushing his knees with his hand\r\n      (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon),\r\n      came up to him smiling. Borís was elegantly dressed, with a slightly\r\n      martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like\r\n      Kutúzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.\nMeanwhile Kutúzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade\r\n      of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run to fetch and\r\n      another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and brilliant suite\r\n      surrounded him.\nThe icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped\r\n      some thirty paces from Kutúzov, talking to Borís.\nHe explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position.\n“This is what you must do,” said Borís. “I will do the honors of the camp\r\n      to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen will be. I\r\n      am in attendance on him, you know; I’ll mention it to him. But if you want\r\n      to ride round the position, come along with us. We are just going to the\r\n      left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night with me and we’ll\r\n      arrange a game of cards. Of course you know Dmítri Sergéevich? Those are\r\n      his quarters,” and he pointed to the third house in the village of Górki.\n“But I should like to see the right flank. They say it’s very strong,”\r\n       said Pierre. “I should like to start from the Moskvá River and ride round\r\n      the whole position.”\n“Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.”\n“Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkónski’s regiment? Can you point it out\r\n      to me?”\n“Prince Andrew’s? We shall pass it and I’ll take you to him.”\n“What about the left flank?” asked Pierre\n“To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our\r\n      left flank is in,” said Borís confidentially lowering his voice. “It is\r\n      not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll\r\n      quite differently, but...” Borís shrugged his shoulders, “his Serene\r\n      Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...” but\r\n      Borís did not finish, for at that moment Kaysárov, Kutúzov’s adjutant,\r\n      came up to Pierre. “Ah, Kaysárov!” said Borís, addressing him with an\r\n      unembarrassed smile, “I was just trying to explain our position to the\r\n      count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the\r\n      intentions of the French!”\n“You mean the left flank?” asked Kaysárov.\n“Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.”\nThough Kutúzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, Borís had\r\n      contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had established\r\n      himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom Borís had been in\r\n      attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskóy an invaluable man.\nIn the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kutúzov’s\r\n      party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Borís belonged to the\r\n      latter and no one else, while showing servile respect to Kutúzov, could so\r\n      create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that\r\n      Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come\r\n      when Kutúzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even\r\n      if Kutúzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by\r\n      Bennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for\r\n      tomorrow’s action, and new men would come to the front. So Borís was full\r\n      of nervous vivacity all day.\nAfter Kaysárov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not\r\n      time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon\r\n      him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed\r\n      animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of the\r\n      excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of\r\n      personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different\r\n      expression he saw on other faces—an expression that spoke not of\r\n      personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death. Kutúzov\r\n      noticed Pierre’s figure and the group gathered round him.\n“Call him to me,” said Kutúzov.\nAn adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness’ wish, and Pierre went\r\n      toward Kutúzov’s bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was\r\n      Dólokhov.\n“How did that fellow get here?” asked Pierre.\n“He’s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!” was the answer. “He has been\r\n      degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He’s been proposing some\r\n      scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy’s picket line at night....\r\n      He’s a brave fellow.”\nPierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutúzov.\n“I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send me\r\n      away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldn’t lose\r\n      anything...” Dólokhov was saying.\n“Yes, yes.”\n“But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland for\r\n      which I am ready to die.”\n“Yes, yes.”\n“And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his\r\n      skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene\r\n      Highness.”\n“Yes... Yes...” Kutúzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and more\r\n      as he looked at Pierre.\nJust then Borís, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to Pierre’s\r\n      side near Kutúzov and in a most natural manner, without raising his voice,\r\n      said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted conversation:\n“The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What\r\n      heroism, Count!”\nBorís evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his Serene\r\n      Highness. He knew Kutúzov’s attention would be caught by those words, and\r\n      so it was.\n“What are you saying about the militia?” he asked Borís.\n“Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness—for death—they\r\n      have put on clean shirts.”\n“Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!” said Kutúzov; and he closed his\r\n      eyes and swayed his head. “A matchless people!” he repeated with a sigh.\n“So you want to smell gunpowder?” he said to Pierre. “Yes, it’s a pleasant\r\n      smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife’s adorers. Is she well? My\r\n      quarters are at your service.”\nAnd as often happens with old people, Kutúzov began looking about\r\n      absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.\nThen, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew\r\n      Kaysárov, his adjutant’s brother.\n“Those verses... those verses of Márin’s... how do they go, eh? Those he\r\n      wrote about Gerákov: ‘Lectures for the corps inditing’... Recite them,\r\n      recite them!” said he, evidently preparing to laugh.\nKaysárov recited.... Kutúzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of\r\n      the verses.\nWhen Pierre had left Kutúzov, Dólokhov came up to him and took his hand.\n“I am very glad to meet you here, Count,” he said aloud, regardless of the\r\n      presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone. “On\r\n      the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to survive, I am\r\n      glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the misunderstandings\r\n      that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling\r\n      for me. I beg you to forgive me.”\nPierre looked at Dólokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him.\r\n      With tears in his eyes Dólokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.\nBorís said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to\r\n      Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.\n“It will interest you,” said he.\n“Yes, very much,” replied Pierre.\nHalf an hour later Kutúzov left for Tatárinova, and Bennigsen and his\r\n      suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line."

    "text": "From Górki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when\r\n      they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as being\r\n      the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by\r\n      the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of Borodinó\r\n      and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of troops and\r\n      guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging. This was the\r\n      redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as the Raévski\r\n      Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special attention to it.\r\n      He did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other\r\n      spot on the plain of Borodinó.\nThey then crossed the hollow to Semënovsk, where the soldiers were\r\n      dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode\r\n      downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by\r\n      hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of\r\n      the plowed land, and reached someflèches* which were still being dug.\n* A kind of entrenchment.\nAt theflèchesBennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevárdino\r\n      Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several\r\n      horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or\r\n      Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of\r\n      horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the\r\n      scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men rode\r\n      away from the mound and disappeared.\nBennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining the\r\n      whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each\r\n      faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but\r\n      was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the\r\n      task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and,\r\n      noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:\n“I don’t think this interests you?”\n“On the contrary it’s very interesting!” replied Pierre not quite\r\n      truthfully.\nFrom theflèchesthey rode still farther to the left, along a road winding\r\n      through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the wood a brown\r\n      hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of the many\r\n      horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them\r\n      for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only when\r\n      several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the\r\n      thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half they\r\n      came out on a glade where troops of Túchkov’s corps were stationed to\r\n      defend the left flank.\nHere, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with\r\n      much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military\r\n      importance. In front of Túchkov’s troops was some high ground not occupied\r\n      by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying that it was\r\n      madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied\r\n      and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed the same\r\n      opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they were put\r\n      there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops\r\n      to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank increased\r\n      Pierre’s doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters.\r\n      Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the\r\n      troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and shared their opinion,\r\n      but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them\r\n      there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder.\nPierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed, put\r\n      there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as an\r\n      ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an\r\n      approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved the\r\n      troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to\r\n      the commander in chief."

    "text": "On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his\r\n      elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkóvo at the further end\r\n      of his regiment’s encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he could\r\n      see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches with their\r\n      lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of oats were standing,\r\n      and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires—the soldiers’\r\n      kitchens.\nNarrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to him,\r\n      Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had\r\n      done seven years before at Austerlitz.\nHe had received and given the orders for next day’s battle and had nothing\r\n      more to do. But his thoughts—the simplest, clearest, and therefore\r\n      most terrible thoughts—would give him no peace. He knew that\r\n      tomorrow’s battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in,\r\n      and for the first time in his life the possibility of death presented\r\n      itself to him—not in relation to any worldly matter or with\r\n      reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to himself, to\r\n      his own soul—vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty.\r\n      And from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented\r\n      and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light\r\n      without shadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline. All\r\n      life appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been\r\n      gazing by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those\r\n      badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. “Yes, yes!\r\n      There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured, and\r\n      tormented me,” said he to himself, passing in review the principal\r\n      pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold\r\n      white daylight of his clear perception of death. “There they are, those\r\n      rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious. Glory,\r\n      the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself—how\r\n      important these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they\r\n      seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold\r\n      white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.” The three\r\n      great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his love for a\r\n      woman, his father’s death, and the French invasion which had overrun half\r\n      Russia. “Love... that little girl who seemed to me brimming over with\r\n      mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made romantic plans of love and\r\n      happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I was!” he said aloud bitterly. “Ah me!\r\n      I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her faithful to me for the\r\n      whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove in the fable she was to\r\n      pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler really.... It was all very\r\n      simple and horrible.”\n“When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his land,\r\n      his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside, unconscious\r\n      of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path, and his Bald\r\n      Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says it is a trial\r\n      sent from above. What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never\r\n      return? He is not here! For whom then is the trial intended? The\r\n      Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I shall be killed,\r\n      perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own men, by a soldier\r\n      discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday, and the\r\n      French will come and take me by head and heels and fling me into a hole\r\n      that I may not stink under their noses, and new conditions of life will\r\n      arise, which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which I shall\r\n      know nothing. I shall not exist....”\nHe looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their\r\n      motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. “To die... to be\r\n      killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still\r\n      be, but no me....”\nAnd the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the smoke of\r\n      the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and\r\n      menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose quickly, went out of\r\n      the shed, and began to walk about.\nAfter he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. “Who’s that?”\r\n       he cried.\nThe red-nosed Captain Timókhin, formerly Dólokhov’s squadron commander,\r\n      but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the\r\n      shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.\nPrince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come about,\r\n      gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss them when he\r\n      heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.\n“Devil take it!” said the voice of a man stumbling over something.\nPrince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped over\r\n      a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was\r\n      unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general, and\r\n      Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his\r\n      last visit to Moscow.\n“You? What a surprise!” said he. “What brings you here? This is\r\n      unexpected!”\nAs he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness—they\r\n      expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached the\r\n      shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew’s face he felt\r\n      constrained and ill at ease.\n“I have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,” said\r\n      Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word\r\n      “interesting.” “I wish to see the battle.”\n“Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they\r\n      stop it?” said Prince Andrew sarcastically. “Well, and how’s Moscow? And\r\n      my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?” he asked seriously.\n“Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskáya told me so. I went to see them, but\r\n      missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.”"

    "text": "The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently\r\n      reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have\r\n      tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with\r\n      surprise at Pierre’s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of Moscow\r\n      and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince Andrew\r\n      remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre\r\n      addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.\n“So you understand the whole position of our troops?” Prince Andrew\r\n      interrupted him.\n“Yes—that is, how do you mean?” said Pierre. “Not being a military\r\n      man I can’t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general\r\n      position.”\n“Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,” said\r\n      Prince Andrew.\n“Oh!” said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince\r\n      Andrew. “Well, and what do you think of Kutúzov’s appointment?” he asked.\n“I was very glad of his appointment, that’s all I know,” replied Prince\r\n      Andrew.\n“And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying\r\n      heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?”\n“Ask them,” replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.\nPierre looked at Timókhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile\r\n      with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.\n“We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your\r\n      excellency,” said Timókhin timidly, and continually turning to glance at\r\n      his colonel.\n“Why so?” asked Pierre.\n“Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when\r\n      we were retreating from Sventsyáni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of\r\n      hay or anything. You see, we were going away, sohewould get it all;\r\n      wasn’t it so, your excellency?” and again Timókhin turned to the prince.\r\n      “But we daren’t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for\r\n      that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became\r\n      straightforward. Now we see light....”\n“Then why was it forbidden?”\nTimókhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer such\r\n      a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.\n“Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy,”\r\n       said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. “It is very sound: one can’t\r\n      permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding. At\r\n      Smolénsk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us, as\r\n      they had larger forces. But he could not understand this,” cried Prince\r\n      Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily: “he\r\n      could not understand that there, for the first time, we were fighting for\r\n      Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the men such as I had never\r\n      seen before, that we had held the French for two days, and that that\r\n      success had increased our strength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and\r\n      all our efforts and losses went for nothing. He had no thought of\r\n      betraying us, he tried to do the best he could, he thought out everything,\r\n      and that is why he is unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he\r\n      plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every German has\r\n      to. How can I explain?... Well, say your father has a German valet, and he\r\n      is a splendid valet and satisfies your father’s requirements better than\r\n      you could, then it’s all right to let him serve. But if your father is\r\n      mortally sick you’ll send the valet away and attend to your father with\r\n      your own unpracticed, awkward hands, and will soothe him better than a\r\n      skilled man who is a stranger could. So it has been with Barclay. While\r\n      Russia was well, a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister;\r\n      but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin. But in your\r\n      Club they have been making him out a traitor! They slander him as a\r\n      traitor, and the only result will be that afterwards, ashamed of their\r\n      false accusations, they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a\r\n      traitor, and that will be still more unjust. He is an honest and very\r\n      punctilious German.”\n“And they say he’s a skillful commander,” rejoined Pierre.\n“I don’t understand what is meant by ‘a skillful commander,’” replied\r\n      Prince Andrew ironically.\n“A skillful commander?” replied Pierre. “Why, one who foresees all\r\n      contingencies... and foresees the adversary’s intentions.”\n“But that’s impossible,” said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter settled\r\n      long ago.\nPierre looked at him in surprise.\n“And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?” he remarked.\n“Yes,” replied Prince Andrew, “but with this little difference, that in\r\n      chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not\r\n      limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always\r\n      stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in\r\n      war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker\r\n      than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be\r\n      known to anyone. Believe me,” he went on, “if things depended on\r\n      arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making arrangements, but\r\n      instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these\r\n      gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow’s battle will depend and not\r\n      on those others.... Success never depends, and never will depend, on\r\n      position, or equipment, or even on numbers, and least of all on position.”\n“But on what then?”\n“On the feeling that is in me and in him,” he pointed to Timókhin, “and in\r\n      each soldier.”\nPrince Andrew glanced at Timókhin, who looked at his commander in alarm\r\n      and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince\r\n      Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from expressing\r\n      the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.\n“A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose\r\n      the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours, but\r\n      very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle, and we did\r\n      lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for there, we\r\n      wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could. ‘We’ve lost,\r\n      so let us run,’ and we ran. If we had not said that till the evening,\r\n      heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we shan’t say it!\r\n      You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the right flank too\r\n      extended,” he went on. “That’s all nonsense, there’s nothing of the kind.\r\n      But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances which\r\n      will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or\r\n      do not run, and that this man or that man is killed, but all that is being\r\n      done at present is only play. The fact is that those men with whom you\r\n      have ridden round the position not only do not help matters, but hinder.\r\n      They are only concerned with their own petty interests.”\n“At such a moment?” said Pierre reproachfully.\n“At such a moment!”Prince Andrew repeated. “To them it is only a moment\r\n      affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or\r\n      ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred thousand\r\n      and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and the thing\r\n      is that these two hundred thousand menwillfight and the side that fights\r\n      more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you like I will\r\n      tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may\r\n      make, we shall win tomorrow’s battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall\r\n      win!”\n“There now, your excellency! That’s the truth, the real truth,” said\r\n      Timókhin. “Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion,\r\n      believe me, wouldn’t drink their vodka! ‘It’s not the day for that!’ they\r\n      say.”\nAll were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed\r\n      with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone Pierre\r\n      approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation when they\r\n      heard the clatter of three horses’ hoofs on the road not far from the\r\n      shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized Wolzogen and\r\n      Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by continuing to\r\n      converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these words:\n“Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug\r\n      Preis geben,”* said one of them.\n* “The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently\r\n     commend that view.”\n“Oh, ja,”said the other,“der Zweck ist nur den Feind\r\n      zu schwächen, so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung\r\n      nehmen.”*\n* “Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of\r\n     course one cannot take into account the loss of private\r\n     individuals.”\n“Oh, no,” agreed the other.\n“Extend widely!” said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had\r\n      ridden past. “In that ‘extend’ were my father, son, and sister, at Bald\r\n      Hills. That’s all the same to him! That’s what I was saying to you—those\r\n      German gentlemen won’t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the\r\n      mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but\r\n      theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven’t in their hearts the one\r\n      thing needed tomorrow—that which Timókhin has. They have yielded up\r\n      all Europe tohim, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!” and\r\n      again his voice grew shrill.\n“So you think we shall win tomorrow’s battle?” asked Pierre.\n“Yes, yes,” answered Prince Andrew absently. “One thing I would do if I\r\n      had the power,” he began again, “I would not take prisoners. Why take\r\n      prisoners? It’s chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on\r\n      their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me every\r\n      moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals. And so\r\n      thinks Timókhin and the whole army. They should be executed! Since they\r\n      are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been said at\r\n      Tilsit.”\n“Yes, yes,” muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew.\r\n      “I quite agree with you!”\nThe question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozháysk hill and all that\r\n      day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now understood\r\n      the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle.\r\n      All he had seen that day, all the significant and stern expressions on the\r\n      faces he had seen in passing, were lit up for him by a new light. He\r\n      understood that latent heat (as they say in physics) of patriotism which\r\n      was present in all these men he had seen, and this explained to him why\r\n      they all prepared for death calmly, and as it were lightheartedly.\n“Not take prisoners,” Prince Andrew continued: “That by itself would quite\r\n      change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have played at\r\n      war—that’s what’s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that stuff.\r\n      Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility\r\n      of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she is so\r\n      kindhearted that she can’t look at blood, but enjoys eating the calf\r\n      served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, of\r\n      flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It’s all rubbish! I\r\n      saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged us and we\r\n      humbugged them. They plunder other people’s houses, issue false paper\r\n      money, and worst of all they kill my children and my father, and then talk\r\n      of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and\r\n      be killed! He who has come to this as I have through the same\r\n      sufferings...”\nPrince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not\r\n      Moscow was taken as Smolénsk had been, was suddenly checked in his speech\r\n      by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a few times in\r\n      silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he\r\n      began speaking.\n“If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only\r\n      when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would\r\n      not be war because Paul Ivánovich had offended Michael Ivánovich. And when\r\n      there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the\r\n      determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these\r\n      Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him\r\n      into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without\r\n      knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and\r\n      we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this\r\n      terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of\r\n      falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the\r\n      favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the\r\n      most highly honored.\n“But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the\r\n      habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are\r\n      spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country’s\r\n      inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and\r\n      falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the\r\n      absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty,\r\n      debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest\r\n      class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese, wear\r\n      military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the highest\r\n      rewards.\n“They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill\r\n      and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for having\r\n      killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they announce\r\n      a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed the greater\r\n      their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear them?”\r\n       exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. “Ah, my friend, it\r\n      has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have begun to\r\n      understand too much. And it doesn’t do for man to taste of the tree of\r\n      knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, it’s not for long!” he added.\n“However, you’re sleepy, and it’s time for me to sleep. Go back to Górki!”\r\n       said Prince Andrew suddenly.\n“Oh no!” Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,\r\n      compassionate eyes.\n“Go, go! Before a battle one must have one’s sleep out,” repeated Prince\r\n      Andrew.\nHe came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. “Good-by, be\r\n      off!” he shouted. “Whether we meet again or not...” and turning away\r\n      hurriedly he entered the shed.\nIt was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the expression\r\n      of Prince Andrew’s face was angry or tender.\nFor some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him\r\n      or go away. “No, he does not want it!” Pierre concluded. “And I know that\r\n      this is our last meeting!” He sighed deeply and rode back to Górki.\nOn re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could not\r\n      sleep.\nHe closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On\r\n      one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening in\r\n      Petersburg. Natásha with animated and excited face was telling him how she\r\n      had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in\r\n      the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of the forest, her\r\n      feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted\r\n      her story to say: “No, I can’t! I’m not telling it right; no, you don’t\r\n      understand,” though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand,\r\n      and he really had understood all she wanted to say. But Natásha was not\r\n      satisfied with her own words: she felt that they did not convey the\r\n      passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to\r\n      convey. “He was such a delightful old man, and it was so dark in the\r\n      forest... and he had such kind... No, I can’t describe it,” she had said,\r\n      flushed and excited. Prince Andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then\r\n      when he had looked into her eyes. “I understood her,” he thought. “I not\r\n      only understood her, but it was just that inner, spiritual force, that\r\n      sincerity, that frankness of soul—that very soul of hers which\r\n      seemed to be fettered by her body—it was that soul I loved in her...\r\n      loved so strongly and happily...” and suddenly he remembered how his love\r\n      had ended. “Hedid not need anything of that kind.Heneither\r\n      saw nor understood anything of the sort. He only saw in her a pretty andfreshyoung girl, with whom he did not deign to unite his fate. And I?... and he\r\n      is still alive and gay!”\nPrince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began\r\n      pacing up and down in front of the shed."

    "text": "On August 25, the eve of the battle of Borodinó, M. de Beausset, prefect\r\n      of the French Emperor’s palace, arrived at Napoleon’s quarters at Valúevo\r\n      with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from Madrid.\nDonning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had brought for\r\n      the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first compartment of\r\n      Napoleon’s tent, where he began opening the box while conversing with\r\n      Napoleon’s aides-de-camp who surrounded him.\nFabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some\r\n      generals of his acquaintance.\nThe Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his\r\n      toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and now\r\n      his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing him\r\n      down. Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle, was\r\n      sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor’s pampered body with an\r\n      expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau\r\n      de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon’s short hair was wet and matted\r\n      on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed physical\r\n      satisfaction. “Go on, harder, go on!” he muttered to the valet who was\r\n      rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp, who had\r\n      entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of prisoners taken\r\n      in yesterday’s action, was standing by the door after delivering his\r\n      message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon, frowning, looked at\r\n      him from under his brows.\n“No prisoners!” said he, repeating the aide-de-camp’s words. “They are\r\n      forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian army....\r\n      Go on... harder, harder!” he muttered, hunching his back and presenting\r\n      his fat shoulders.\n“All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,” he said,\r\n      nodding to the aide-de-camp.\n“Yes, sire,” and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the\r\n      tent.\nTwo valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of\r\n      the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.\nDe Beausset’s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he\r\n      had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of the\r\n      entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected\r\n      rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.\nNapoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were\r\n      not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a\r\n      surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to\r\n      him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him of\r\n      the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at the other\r\n      end of Europe, with but one thought—to be worthy of their Emperor—and\r\n      but one fear—to fail to please him. The result of that battle had\r\n      been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during Fabvier’s account, as\r\n      if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence.\n“I must make up for that in Moscow,” said Napoleon. “I’ll see you later,”\r\n       he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had prepared the\r\n      surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a\r\n      cloth.\nDe Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the old\r\n      retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him, presenting\r\n      an envelope.\nNapoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.\n“You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?” he\r\n      asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial\r\n      tone.\n“Sire, all Paris regrets your absence,” replied de Beausset as was proper.\nBut though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this\r\n      kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was\r\n      pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.\n“I am very sorry to have made you travel so far,” said he.\n“Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,”\r\n       replied de Beausset.\nNapoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the\r\n      right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a\r\n      gold snuffbox, which he took.\n“Yes, it has happened luckily for you,” he said, raising the open snuffbox\r\n      to his nose. “You are fond of travel, and in three days you will see\r\n      Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital. You will\r\n      have a pleasant journey.”\nDe Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of\r\n      which he had not till then been aware).\n“Ha, what’s this?” asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were\r\n      looking at something concealed under a cloth.\nWith courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his\r\n      back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the same\r\n      time, and said:\n“A present to Your Majesty from the Empress.”\nIt was a portrait, painted in bright colors by Gérard, of the son borne to\r\n      Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for some\r\n      reason everyone called “The King of Rome.”\nA very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine\r\n      Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the\r\n      terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.\nThough it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the\r\n      so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory\r\n      apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in\r\n      Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.\n“The King of Rome!” he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful\r\n      gesture. “Admirable!”\nWith the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of his\r\n      face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive\r\n      tenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would be historical, and\r\n      it seemed to him that it would now be best for him—whose grandeur\r\n      enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe—to\r\n      show, in contrast to that grandeur, the simplest paternal tenderness. His\r\n      eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round at a chair (which seemed to\r\n      place itself under him), and sat down on it before the portrait. At a\r\n      single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe, leaving the great man\r\n      to himself and his emotion.\nHaving sat still for a while he touched—himself not knowing why—the\r\n      thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait, rose,\r\n      and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the portrait\r\n      to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed round it,\r\n      might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of Rome, the son\r\n      and heir of their adored monarch.\nAnd while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with him,\r\n      they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the\r\n      officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.\n“Vive l’Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l’Empereur!”came those ecstatic cries.\nAfter breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset’s presence dictated his order of\r\n      the day to the army.\n“Short and energetic!” he remarked when he had read over the proclamation\r\n      which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It ran:\nSoldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on\r\n      you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable\r\n      quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at\r\n      Austerlitz, Friedland, Vítebsk, and Smolénsk. Let our remotest posterity\r\n      recall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of\r\n      you: “He was in the great battle before Moscow!”\n“Before Moscow!” repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was\r\n      so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent\r\n      to where the horses stood saddled.\n“Your Majesty is too kind!” replied de Beausset to the invitation to\r\n      accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and\r\n      was afraid of doing so.\nBut Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount. When\r\n      Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his son’s\r\n      portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.\n“Take him away!” he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to\r\n      the portrait. “It is too soon for him to see a field of battle.”\nDe Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to\r\n      indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor’s words."

    "text": "On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon spent\r\n      the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans\r\n      submitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his\r\n      generals.\nThe original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolochá had been\r\n      dislocated by the capture of the Shevárdino Redoubt on the twenty-fourth,\r\n      and part of the line—the left flank—had been drawn back. That\r\n      part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was more\r\n      open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone, military or not,\r\n      that it was here the French should attack. It would seem that not much\r\n      consideration was needed to reach this conclusion, nor any particular care\r\n      or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his marshals, nor was there any\r\n      need of that special and supreme quality called genius that people are so\r\n      apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the historians who described the event\r\n      later and the men who then surrounded Napoleon, and he himself, thought\r\n      otherwise.\nNapoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound air\r\n      and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously, and\r\n      without communicating to the generals around him the profound course of\r\n      ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final conclusions in\r\n      the form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion from Davout, who was\r\n      now called Prince d’Eckmühl, to turn the Russian left wing, Napoleon said\r\n      it should not be done, without explaining why not. To a proposal made by\r\n      General Campan (who was to attack theflèches) to lead his division\r\n      through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though the so-called Duke of Elchingen\r\n      (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous\r\n      and might disorder the division.\nHaving inspected the country opposite the Shevárdino Redoubt, Napoleon\r\n      pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two\r\n      batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian\r\n      entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field\r\n      artillery should be placed.\nAfter giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the\r\n      dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.\nThese dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm\r\n      and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:\nAt dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain\r\n      occupied by the Prince d’Eckmühl will open fire on the opposing batteries\r\n      of the enemy.\nAt the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps, General\r\n      Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan’s division and all the howitzers of\r\n      Dessaix’s and Friant’s divisions, will move forward, open fire, and\r\n      overwhelm with shellfire the enemy’s battery, against which will operate:\nThe commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouché, will\r\n      place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the\r\n      flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left,\r\n      which will have forty guns in all directed against it.\nGeneral Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the\r\n      howitzers of the Guard’s artillery against either one or other of the\r\n      entrenchments.\nDuring the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood on\r\n      the village and turn the enemy’s position.\nGeneral Campan will move through the wood to seize the first\r\n      fortification.\nAfter the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in\r\n      accordance with the enemy’s movements.\nThe cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the\r\n      right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand’s division and of the\r\n      vice-King’s division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack commence\r\n      on the right wing.\nThe vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges,\r\n      advancing to the same heights as Morand’s and Gibrard’s divisions, which\r\n      under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into\r\n      line with the rest of the forces.\nAll this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et\r\n      méthode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.\nThe Imperial Camp near Mozháysk,\nSeptember, 6, 1812.\n\nThese dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows\r\n      oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius,\r\n      related to Napoleon’s orders to deal with four points—four different\r\n      orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.\nIn the disposition it is said firstthat the batteries placed on the spot\r\n      chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouché; which were to\r\n      come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and shower\r\n      shells on the Russianflèchesand redoubts.This could not be done, as\r\n      from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the\r\n      Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until the nearest\r\n      commander, contrary to Napoleon’s instructions, moved them forward.\nThe second order was thatPoniatowski, moving to the village through the\r\n      wood, should turn the Russian left flank.This could not be done and was\r\n      not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the wood,\r\n      met Túchkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn the\r\n      Russian position.\nThe third order was:General Campan will move through the wood to seize\r\n      the first fortification. General Campan’s division did not seize the\r\n      first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood it had\r\n      to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.\nThe fourth order was:The vice-King will occupy the village(Borodinó)and\r\n      cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand’s and\r\n      Gérard’s divisions(for whose movements no directions are given),which\r\n      under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into\r\n      line with the rest of the forces.\nAs far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible sentence\r\n      as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders given him,\r\n      he was to advance from the left through Borodinó to the redoubt while the\r\n      divisions of Morand and Gérard were to advance simultaneously from the\r\n      front.\nAll this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could not\r\n      be executed. After passing through Borodinó the vice-King was driven back\r\n      to the Kolochá and could get no farther; while the divisions of Morand and\r\n      Gérard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the redoubt was\r\n      only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing probably\r\n      unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of the orders in the\r\n      disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the disposition it is said\r\n      that,after the fight has commenced in this manner, orders will be given\r\n      in accordance with the enemy’s movements, and so it might be supposed that\r\n      all necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle.\r\n      But this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle\r\n      Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know the\r\n      course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be\r\n      executed."

    "text": "Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodinó\r\n      because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the orders\r\n      he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of\r\n      genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been\r\n      changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of\r\n      one man—Peter the Great—and that France from a republic became\r\n      an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one man—Napoleon—to\r\n      say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the\r\n      twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.\nIf it had depended on Napoleon’s will to fight or not to fight the battle\r\n      of Borodinó, and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will,\r\n      then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have\r\n      saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring Napoleon his\r\n      waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been the savior of\r\n      Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable, as\r\n      indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what\r\n      he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was\r\n      due to Charles IX’s stomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit\r\n      that Russia was formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French\r\n      Empire was formed and the war with Russia begun by the will of one man,\r\n      Napoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational, but\r\n      contrary to all human reality. To the question of what causes historic\r\n      events another answer presents itself, namely, that the course of human\r\n      events is predetermined from on high—depends on the coincidence of\r\n      the wills of all who take part in the events, and that a Napoleon’s\r\n      influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious.\nStrange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of St.\r\n      Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX’s will, though he gave the order for\r\n      it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and strange as it\r\n      may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at Borodinó\r\n      was not due to Napoleon’s will, though he ordered the commencement and\r\n      conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it;\r\n      strange as these suppositions appear, yet human dignity—which tells\r\n      me that each of us is, if not more at least not less a man than the great\r\n      Napoleon—demands the acceptance of that solution of the question,\r\n      and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.\nAt the battle of Borodinó Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one. That\r\n      was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed people.\nThe French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodinó\r\n      not because of Napoleon’s orders but by their own volition. The whole army—French,\r\n      Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch—hungry, ragged, and weary of the\r\n      campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to Moscow that\r\n      the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then forbidden them to\r\n      fight the Russians, they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight\r\n      the Russians because it was inevitable.\nWhen they heard Napoleon’s proclamation offering them, as compensation for\r\n      mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been in\r\n      the battle before Moscow, they cried“Vive l’Empereur!”just as they had cried“Vive l’Empereur!”at the sight of\r\n      the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just\r\n      as they would have cried“Vive l’Empereur!”at any\r\n      nonsense that might be told them. There was nothing left for them to do but cry“Vive l’Empereur!”and go to fight, in order to get food\r\n      and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of Napoleon’s\r\n      commands that they killed their fellow men.\nAnd it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none of\r\n      his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was\r\n      going on before him. So the way in which these people killed one another\r\n      was not decided by Napoleon’s will but occurred independently of him, in\r\n      accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in\r\n      the common action. Itonly seemedto Napoleon that it all took place by\r\n      his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more\r\n      historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers.\nMoreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the\r\n      cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former\r\n      occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as\r\n      previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon’s cold on\r\n      the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.\nThe dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even better,\r\n      than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. His\r\n      pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but much\r\n      the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse than\r\n      previous ones because the battle of Borodinó was the first Napoleon did\r\n      not win. The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem\r\n      very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of\r\n      importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the very\r\n      worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people fill\r\n      whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle\r\n      that has been won.\nThe dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were a\r\n      model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were\r\n      criticized—criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive\r\n      minuteness.\nNapoleon at the battle of Borodinó fulfilled his office as representative\r\n      of authority as well as, and even better than, at other battles. He did\r\n      nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he inclined to the most\r\n      reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not contradict himself, did\r\n      not get frightened or run away from the field of battle, but with his\r\n      great tact and military experience carried out his role of appearing to\r\n      command, calmly and with dignity."

    "text": "On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:\n“The chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!”\nHaving ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him\r\n      about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress’\r\n      household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating\r\n      to the court.\nHe showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset’s love of\r\n      travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who\r\n      knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron\r\n      while a patient is being strapped to the operating table. “The matter is\r\n      in my hands and is clear and definite in my head. When the time comes to\r\n      set to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and\r\n      the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you\r\n      ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.”\nHaving finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before\r\n      the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He was so\r\n      much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and in spite of\r\n      his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening, he went\r\n      into the large division of the tent at three o’clock in the morning,\r\n      loudly blowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had not withdrawn,\r\n      and was told that the enemy’s fires were still in the same places. He\r\n      nodded approval.\nThe adjutant in attendance came into the tent.\n“Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?” Napoleon asked\r\n      him.\n“Without doubt, sire,” replied Rapp.\nNapoleon looked at him.\n“Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at Smolénsk?”\r\n       continued Rapp. “The wine is drawn and must be drunk.”\nNapoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his\r\n      hand.\n“This poor army!” he suddenly remarked. “It has diminished greatly since\r\n      Smolénsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so and\r\n      I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards are\r\n      intact?” he remarked interrogatively.\n“Yes, sire,” replied Rapp.\nNapoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch. He\r\n      was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible to\r\n      give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had all\r\n      been given and were now being executed.\n“Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the\r\n      Guards?” asked Napoleon sternly.\n“Yes, sire.”\n“The rice too?”\nRapp replied that he had given the Emperor’s order about the rice, but\r\n      Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his\r\n      order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon ordered\r\n      another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his own.\n“I have neither taste nor smell,” he remarked, sniffing at his glass.\r\n      “This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine—what is the good of\r\n      medicine when it can’t cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but\r\n      they don’t help at all. What can doctors cure? One can’t cure anything.\r\n      Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its\r\n      nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it will\r\n      do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies. Our body\r\n      is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the watchmaker\r\n      cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that blindfold....\r\n      Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.”\nAnd having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,\r\n      Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.\n“Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?” asked he. “It is the art of\r\n      being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That’s all.”\nRapp made no reply.\n“Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutúzov!” said Napoleon. “We shall\r\n      see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and\r\n      did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We shall see!”\nHe looked at his watch. It was still only four o’clock. He did not feel\r\n      sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He rose,\r\n      walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went out of the\r\n      tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible moisture was\r\n      descending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly burning among the\r\n      French Guards, and in the distance those of the Russian line shone through\r\n      the smoke. The weather was calm, and the rustle and tramp of the French\r\n      troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were clearly\r\n      audible.\nNapoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and\r\n      listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a\r\n      shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn\r\n      himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped\r\n      in front of him.\n“What year did you enter the service?” he asked with that affectation of\r\n      military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the\r\n      soldiers.\nThe man answered the question.\n“Ah! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?”\n“It has, Your Majesty.”\nNapoleon nodded and walked away.\n\nAt half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevárdino.\nIt was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in the\r\n      east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint\r\n      morning light.\nOn the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in\r\n      the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report\r\n      shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the\r\n      right.\nThe first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out\r\n      and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.\nNapoleon with his suite rode up to the Shevárdino Redoubt where he\r\n      dismounted. The game had begun."

    "text": "On returning to Górki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre ordered his\r\n      groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning, and\r\n      then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner Borís had\r\n      given up to him.\nBefore he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left the\r\n      hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was\r\n      shaking him.\n“Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!” he kept repeating\r\n      pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at\r\n      him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.\n“What? Has it begun? Is it time?” Pierre asked, waking up.\n“Hear the firing,” said the groom, a discharged soldier. “All the\r\n      gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long\r\n      ago.”\nPierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright,\r\n      fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a\r\n      cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken by\r\n      the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on the dew-besprinkled\r\n      dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on the windows, the fence,\r\n      and on Pierre’s horses standing before the hut. The roar of guns sounded\r\n      more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a Cossack passed by at a\r\n      sharp trot.\n“It’s time, Count; it’s time!” cried the adjutant.\nTelling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the\r\n      street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the\r\n      day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the\r\n      staff could be heard conversing in French, and Kutúzov’s gray head in a\r\n      white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his\r\n      shoulders. He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before\r\n      him.\nMounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him,\r\n      spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that\r\n      spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and\r\n      covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the bright\r\n      sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it through the\r\n      clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden-tinted light and\r\n      long dark shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama\r\n      seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green color; its\r\n      undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced\r\n      beyond Valúevo by the Smolénsk highroad crowded with troops. Nearer at\r\n      hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses. There were\r\n      troops to be seen everywhere, in front and to the right and left. All this\r\n      was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all\r\n      was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodinó and the hollows on\r\n      both sides of the Kolochá.\nAbove the Kolochá, in Borodinó and on both sides of it, especially to the\r\n      left where the Vóyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the\r\n      Kolochá, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to\r\n      become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored\r\n      and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist, and\r\n      over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun\r\n      were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from the dew,\r\n      and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and\r\n      in Borodinó. A white church could be seen through the mist, and here and\r\n      there the roofs of huts in Borodinó as well as dense masses of soldiers,\r\n      or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to\r\n      move, as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space. Just as in\r\n      the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodinó, so along the entire line outside\r\n      and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left, in the\r\n      valleys and on the summits of the high ground, clouds of powder smoke\r\n      seemed continually to spring up out of nothing, now singly, now several at\r\n      a time, some translucent, others dense, which, swelling, growing, rolling,\r\n      and blending, extended over the whole expanse.\nThese puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing produced\r\n      the chief beauty of the spectacle.\n“Puff!”—suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen\r\n      merging from violet into gray and milky white, and“boom!”came\r\n      the report a second later.\n“Puff! puff!”—and two clouds arose pushing one another\r\n      and blending together; and“boom, boom!”came the sounds\r\n      confirming what the eye had seen.\nPierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round\r\n      compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to\r\n      one side, and—“puff”(with a pause)—“puff,\r\n      puff!”three and then four more appeared and then from each, with the\r\n      same interval—“boom—boom, boom!”came the fine, firm,\r\n      precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and\r\n      sometimes stood still while woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them.\r\n      From the left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were continually\r\n      appearing followed by their solemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and\r\n      woods, there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls,\r\n      but had their little echoes in just the same way.“Trakh-ta-ta-takh!”came the frequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in\r\n      comparison with the reports of the cannon.\nPierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that\r\n      movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutúzov and his suite, to\r\n      compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking at the\r\n      field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the same\r\n      feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of\r\n      feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after\r\n      his talk with Prince Andrew.\n“Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!” Kutúzov was saying to\r\n      a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the battlefield.\nHaving received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down\r\n      the knoll.\n“To the crossing!” said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of\r\n      the staff who asked where he was going.\n“I’ll go there too, I too!” thought Pierre, and followed the general.\nThe general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to his\r\n      groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest,\r\n      clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes pressed\r\n      his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles were slipping\r\n      off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he galloped after the\r\n      general, causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the\r\n      knoll."

    "text": "Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping\r\n      turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped in\r\n      among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass\r\n      either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers\r\n      everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some\r\n      unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same\r\n      dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat,\r\n      who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse’s\r\n      hoofs.\n“Why ride into the middle of the battalion?” one of them shouted at him.\nAnother prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,\r\n      bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse,\r\n      galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.\nThere was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing. Pierre\r\n      rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the bridge\r\n      across the Kolochá between Górki and Borodinó, which the French (having\r\n      occupied Borodinó) were attacking in the first phase of the battle. Pierre\r\n      saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing\r\n      something on both sides of it and in the meadow, among the rows of\r\n      new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the\r\n      campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing going on there\r\n      he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did not notice the\r\n      sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the projectiles that\r\n      flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and\r\n      for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded, though many fell\r\n      near him. He looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face.\n“Why’s that fellow in front of the line?” shouted somebody at him again.\n“To the left!... Keep to the right!” the men shouted to him.\nPierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Raévski’s\r\n      adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently also\r\n      intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.\n“How have you got here?” he said, and galloped on.\nPierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of\r\n      getting in someone’s way again, galloped after the adjutant.\n“What’s happening here? May I come with you?” he asked.\n“One moment, one moment!” replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout\r\n      colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and then\r\n      addressed Pierre.\n“Why have you come here, Count?” he asked with a smile. “Still\r\n      inquisitive?”\n“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.\nBut the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.\n“Here it’s tolerable,” said he, “but with Bagratión on the left flank\r\n      they’re getting it frightfully hot.”\n“Really?” said Pierre. “Where is that?”\n“Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in our\r\n      battery it is still bearable,” said the adjutant. “Will you come?”\n“Yes, I’ll come with you,” replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.\nIt was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being\r\n      carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day\r\n      before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his head\r\n      thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.\n“Why haven’t they carried him away?” Pierre was about to ask, but seeing\r\n      the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he\r\n      checked himself.\nPierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant\r\n      to Raévski’s Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutant’s and jolted\r\n      him at every step.\n“You don’t seem to be used to riding, Count?” remarked the adjutant.\n“No it’s not that, but her action seems so jerky,” said Pierre in a\r\n      puzzled tone.\n“Why... she’s wounded!” said the adjutant. “In the off foreleg above the\r\n      knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of\r\n      fire!”\nHaving ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery\r\n      which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the\r\n      noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet,\r\n      with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up\r\n      the hill on foot.\n“Is the general here?” asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.\n“He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,” someone told him,\r\n      pointing to the right.\nThe adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.\n“Don’t trouble about me,” said Pierre. “I’ll go up onto the knoll if I\r\n      may?”\n“Yes, do. You’ll see everything from there and it’s less dangerous, and\r\n      I’ll come for you.”\nPierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet\r\n      again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that day.\nThe knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to\r\n      the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raévski’s Redoubt, and to the French\r\n      asla grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre, around\r\n      which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as the key to\r\n      the whole position.\nThis redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had\r\n      been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired\r\n      through openings in the earthwork.\nIn line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired\r\n      incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending that\r\n      knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches had\r\n      been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most important\r\n      point of the battle.\nOn the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one of\r\n      the least significant parts of the field.\nHaving reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench\r\n      surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an\r\n      unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the\r\n      battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers\r\n      who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past him with\r\n      bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired continually\r\n      one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the whole neighborhood\r\n      in powder smoke.\nIn contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support, here\r\n      in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were\r\n      separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and as\r\n      it were family feeling of animation.\nThe intrusion of Pierre’s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an\r\n      unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with\r\n      surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery\r\n      officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if\r\n      to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.\nA young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just out\r\n      of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns entrusted\r\n      to him, addressed Pierre sternly.\n“Sir,” he said, “permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be\r\n      here.”\nThe soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre.\r\n      But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was\r\n      doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a\r\n      shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up and down the\r\n      battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard, their feeling\r\n      of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering\r\n      sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in\r\n      general for the animals that live with the regiment. The men soon accepted\r\n      Pierre into their family, adopted him, gave him a nickname (“our\r\n      gentleman”), and made kindly fun of him among themselves.\nA shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around with\r\n      a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.\n“And how’s it you’re not afraid, sir, really now?” a red-faced,\r\n      broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set of\r\n      sound, white teeth.\n“Are you afraid, then?” said Pierre.\n“What else do you expect?” answered the soldier. “She has no mercy, you\r\n      know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One can’t help\r\n      being afraid,” he said laughing.\nSeveral of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre. They\r\n      seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the\r\n      discovery that he did so delighted them.\n“It’s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it’s wonderful!\r\n      There’s a gentleman for you!”\n“To your places!” cried the young officer to the men gathered round\r\n      Pierre.\nThe young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or\r\n      second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with\r\n      great precision and formality.\nThe booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more\r\n      intense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagratión’sflècheswere, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost\r\n      impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole attention was\r\n      engrossed by watching the family circle—separated from all else—formed\r\n      by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of joyful\r\n      animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now\r\n      replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone\r\n      in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he observed the\r\n      faces of those around him.\nBy ten o’clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the\r\n      battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more\r\n      frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around.\r\n      But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices and\r\n      jokes were heard on all sides.\n“A live one!” shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.\n“Not this way! To the infantry!” added another with loud laughter, seeing\r\n      the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.\n“Are you bowing to a friend, eh?” remarked another, chaffing a peasant who\r\n      ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.\nSeveral soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see\r\n      what was happening in front.\n“They’ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,” said they, pointing\r\n      over the earthwork.\n“Mind your own business,” an old sergeant shouted at them. “If they’ve\r\n      retired it’s because there’s work for them to do farther back.”\nAnd the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a shove\r\n      with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.\n“To the fifth gun, wheel it up!” came shouts from one side.\n“Now then, all together, like bargees!” rose the merry voices of those who\r\n      were moving the gun.\n“Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman’s hat off!” cried the red-faced\r\n      humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. “Awkward baggage!” he added\r\n      reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man’s leg.\n“Now then, you foxes!” said another, laughing at some militiamen who,\r\n      stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.\n“So this gruel isn’t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You’re scared!” they\r\n      shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg\r\n      had been torn off.\n“There, lads... oh, oh!” they mimicked the peasants, “they don’t like it\r\n      at all!”\nPierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after every\r\n      loss, the liveliness increased more and more.\nAs the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and\r\n      rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to what\r\n      was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more\r\n      intense glowed in the faces of these men.\nPierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know\r\n      what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire\r\n      which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the\r\n      same way in his own soul.\nAt ten o’clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the\r\n      battery and along the Kámenka streamlet retreated. From the battery they\r\n      could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their\r\n      muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and after speaking\r\n      to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again having\r\n      ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down, so as to be\r\n      less exposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks of infantry to the\r\n      right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command, and\r\n      from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward.\nPierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by a\r\n      pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking backwards\r\n      and kept glancing uneasily around.\nThe ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long-drawn\r\n      shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few minutes later\r\n      crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from that direction.\r\n      Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery. Several\r\n      men were lying about who had not been removed. Around the cannon the men\r\n      moved still more briskly and busily. No one any longer took notice of\r\n      Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being in the way. The senior\r\n      officer moved with big, rapid strides from one gun to another with a\r\n      frowning face. The young officer, with his face still more flushed,\r\n      commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the\r\n      charges, turned, loaded, and did their business with strained smartness.\r\n      They gave little jumps as they walked, as though they were on springs.\nThe stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which Pierre\r\n      had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the\r\n      commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to\r\n      his superior.\n“I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are we\r\n      to continue firing?” he asked.\n“Grapeshot!” the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking\r\n      over the wall of the trench.\nSuddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending\r\n      double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything\r\n      became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre’s eyes.\nOne cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a\r\n      soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before, now\r\n      heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting\r\n      “Hurrah!” were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.\nA cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was\r\n      standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes\r\n      and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were\r\n      entering the battery ran back.\n“All with grapeshot!” shouted the officer.\nThe sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed\r\n      him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of\r\n      some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.\n“The scoundrels! What are they doing?” shouted the officer, turning to\r\n      Pierre.\nThe officer’s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his\r\n      frowning brow.\n“Run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!” he yelled,\r\n      angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.\n“I’ll go,” said Pierre.\nThe officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side.\n“Don’t fire.... Wait!” he shouted.\nThe man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against Pierre.\n“Eh, sir, this is no place for you,” said he, and ran down the slope.\nPierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was\r\n      sitting.\nOne cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front,\r\n      beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. “Where am I going?” he\r\n      suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition\r\n      wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on.\r\n      Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the\r\n      same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a\r\n      deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.\nWhen he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands;\r\n      the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed, only\r\n      charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a horse,\r\n      dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while another\r\n      horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and piercing\r\n      cries."

    "text": "Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery,\r\n      as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.\nOn entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something\r\n      there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no time\r\n      to realize who these men were. He saw the senior officer lying on the\r\n      earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something down\r\n      below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling\r\n      forward shouting “Brothers!” and trying to free himself from some men who\r\n      were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else that was strange.\nBut he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that the\r\n      soldier shouting “Brothers!” was a prisoner, and that another man had been\r\n      bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run into the\r\n      redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue uniform\r\n      rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively guarding\r\n      against the shock—for they had been running together at full speed\r\n      before they saw one another—Pierre put out his hands and seized the\r\n      man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the throat\r\n      with the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by his\r\n      collar.\nFor some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another’s\r\n      unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what\r\n      they were to do next. “Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?”\r\n       each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more inclined to\r\n      think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre’s strong hand, impelled by\r\n      instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and tighter. The\r\n      Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their heads,\r\n      terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre that the\r\n      French officer’s head had been torn off, so swiftly had he ducked it.\nPierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought\r\n      as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery\r\n      and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who, it\r\n      seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he reached the foot of the\r\n      knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who, stumbling,\r\n      tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward the battery.\r\n      (This was the attack for which Ermólov claimed the credit, declaring that\r\n      only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible: it was the\r\n      attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. George’s Crosses he had\r\n      in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to take who got\r\n      there.)\nThe French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting\r\n      “Hurrah!” pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult to\r\n      call them back.\nThe prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was a\r\n      wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of wounded—some\r\n      known to Pierre and some unknown—Russians and French, with faces\r\n      distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on stretchers\r\n      from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent\r\n      over an hour, and of that family circle which had received him as a member\r\n      he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom he did not know,\r\n      but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in the same way, bent\r\n      double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wall. The red-faced\r\n      man was still twitching, but they did not carry him away.\nPierre ran down the slope once more.\n“Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have\r\n      done!” he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers\r\n      moving from the battlefield.\nBut behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and\r\n      especially to the left, near Semënovsk, something seemed to be seething in\r\n      the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but even\r\n      increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks with\r\n      all his remaining strength."

    "text": "The chief action of the battle of Borodinó was fought within the seven\r\n      thousand feet between Borodinó and Bagratión’sflèches. Beyond that\r\n      space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians with\r\n      Uvárov’s cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond Utítsa,\r\n      Poniatowski’s collision with Túchkov; but these two were detached and\r\n      feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the\r\n      battlefield. On the field between Borodinó and theflèches, beside the\r\n      wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from\r\n      both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.\nThe battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns.\nThen when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions, Campan’s\r\n      and Dessaix’s, advanced from the French right, while Murat’s troops\r\n      advanced on Borodinó from their left.\nFrom the Shevárdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing theflècheswere\r\n      two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies\r\n      to Borodinó, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there,\r\n      especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality. The\r\n      soldiers of Dessaix’s division advancing against theflèchescould\r\n      only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and theflèches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke of the\r\n      guns and musketry on theflèchesgrew so dense that it covered the whole\r\n      approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could be caught of\r\n      something black—probably men—and at times the glint of\r\n      bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were\r\n      French or Russian, could not be discovered from the Shevárdino Redoubt.\nThe sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into\r\n      Napoleon’s face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at theflèches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if\r\n      the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts\r\n      were heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was\r\n      being done there.\nNapoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in its\r\n      small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes Russians,\r\n      but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell where what\r\n      he had seen was.\nHe descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.\nOccasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at the\r\n      battlefield.\nBut not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where\r\n      he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some of his\r\n      generals had taken their stand, but even from theflèchesthemselves—in\r\n      which by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers,\r\n      alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or maddened—even\r\n      at thoseflèchesthemselves it was impossible to make out what was taking\r\n      place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire,\r\n      now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now infantry, and now\r\n      cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not knowing what to do with\r\n      one another, screamed, and ran back again.\nFrom the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his\r\n      marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress of\r\n      the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was\r\n      impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given\r\n      moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of\r\n      conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also because\r\n      while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon circumstances\r\n      changed and the news he brought was already becoming false. Thus an\r\n      adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that Borodinó had been\r\n      occupied and the bridge over the Kolochá was in the hands of the French.\r\n      The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the troops to cross it?\r\n      Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the farther side\r\n      and wait. But before that order was given—almost as soon in fact as\r\n      the adjutant had left Borodinó—the bridge had been retaken by the\r\n      Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre had been present\r\n      at the beginning of the battle.\nAn adjutant galloped up from theflècheswith a pale and frightened face\r\n      and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan\r\n      wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been\r\n      told that the French had been repulsed, theflècheshad in fact been\r\n      recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive and only slightly\r\n      bruised. On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports Napoleon\r\n      gave his orders, which had either been executed before he gave them or\r\n      could not be and were not executed.\nThe marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle but,\r\n      like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only\r\n      occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements without\r\n      asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to fire and\r\n      where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even their\r\n      orders, like Napoleon’s, were seldom carried out, and then but partially.\r\n      For the most part things happened contrary to their orders. Soldiers\r\n      ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers ordered to\r\n      remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly before\r\n      them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward, and the cavalry dashed\r\n      without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians. In this way two cavalry\r\n      regiments galloped through the Semënovsk hollow and as soon as they\r\n      reached the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back\r\n      again. The infantry moved in the same way, sometimes running to quite\r\n      other places than those they were ordered to go to. All orders as to where\r\n      and when to move the guns, when to send infantry to shoot or horsemen to\r\n      ride down the Russian infantry—all such orders were given by the\r\n      officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned, without asking either\r\n      Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less Napoleon. They did not fear getting into\r\n      trouble for not fulfilling orders or for acting on their own initiative,\r\n      for in battle what is at stake is what is dearest to man—his own\r\n      life—and it sometimes seems that safety lies in running back,\r\n      sometimes in running forward; and these men who were right in the heat of\r\n      the battle acted according to the mood of the moment. In reality, however,\r\n      all these movements forward and backward did not improve or alter the\r\n      position of the troops. All their rushing and galloping at one another did\r\n      little harm, the harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and\r\n      bullets that flew over the fields on which these men were floundering\r\n      about. As soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were\r\n      flying about, their superiors, located in the background, re-formed them\r\n      and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that\r\n      discipline led them back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of\r\n      fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the\r\n      chance promptings of the throng."

    "text": "Napoleon’s generals—Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that\r\n      region of fire and sometimes even entered it—repeatedly led into it\r\n      huge masses of well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always\r\n      happened in their former battles, instead of the news they expected of the\r\n      enemy’s flight, these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and\r\n      terrified mobs. The generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly\r\n      decreased. In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to\r\n      demand reinforcements.\nNapoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Murat’s\r\n      adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed\r\n      if His Majesty would let him have another division.\n“Reinforcements?” said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at\r\n      the adjutant—a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like\r\n      Murat’s own—as though he did not understand his words.\n“Reinforcements!” thought Napoleon to himself. “How can they need\r\n      reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a\r\n      weak, unentrenched Russian wing?”\n“Tell the King of Naples,” said he sternly, “that it is not noon yet, and\r\n      I don’t yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...”\nThe handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without\r\n      removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being\r\n      slaughtered.\nNapoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began talking\r\n      to them about matters unconnected with the battle.\nIn the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest\r\n      Napoleon, Berthier’s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who\r\n      was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard.\r\n      Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in a\r\n      loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending\r\n      reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the\r\n      Emperor would give another division.\nNapoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without\r\n      replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the\r\n      suite around him.\n“You are very fiery, Belliard,” said Napoleon, when he again came up to\r\n      the general. “In the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. Go and\r\n      have another look and then come back to me.”\nBefore Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the\r\n      battlefield galloped up.\n“Now then, what do you want?” asked Napoleon in the tone of a man\r\n      irritated at being continually disturbed.\n“Sire, the prince...” began the adjutant.\n“Asks for reinforcements?” said Napoleon with an angry gesture.\nThe adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the\r\n      Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and\r\n      called Berthier.\n“We must give reserves,” he said, moving his arms slightly apart. “Who do\r\n      you think should be sent there?” he asked of Berthier (whom he\r\n      subsequently termed “that gosling I have made an eagle”).\n“Send Claparède’s division, sire,” replied Berthier, who knew all the\r\n      division’s regiments, and battalions by heart.\nNapoleon nodded assent.\nThe adjutant galloped to Claparède’s division and a few minutes later the\r\n      Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. Napoleon gazed\r\n      silently in that direction.\n“No!” he suddenly said to Berthier. “I can’t send Claparède. Send Friant’s\r\n      division.”\nThough there was no advantage in sending Friant’s division instead of\r\n      Claparède’s, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping\r\n      Claparède and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly.\r\n      Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part\r\n      of a doctor who hinders by his medicines—a role he so justly\r\n      understood and condemned.\nFriant’s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the\r\n      battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop and\r\n      as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all asked for\r\n      reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their positions\r\n      and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was melting\r\n      away.\nNapoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.\nM. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning,\r\n      came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His\r\n      Majesty.\n“I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?” said he.\nNapoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the negation to\r\n      refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beausset ventured\r\n      with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not\r\n      having lunch when one can get it.\n“Go away...” exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.\nA beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. de\r\n      Beausset’s face and he glided away to the other generals.\nNapoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an\r\n      ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always\r\n      winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game,\r\n      finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he loses.\nHis troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations had\r\n      been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamationcourte et\r\n      énergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that he\r\n      was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the enemy was\r\n      the same as at Austerlitz and Friedland—yet the terrible stroke of\r\n      his arm had supernaturally become impotent.\nAll the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the\r\n      concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break\r\n      the enemy’s line, and a cavalry attack by “the men of iron,” all these\r\n      methods had already been employed, yet not only was there no victory, but\r\n      from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded, of\r\n      reinforcements needed, of the impossibility of driving back the Russians,\r\n      and of disorganization among his own troops.\nFormerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few\r\n      phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations\r\n      and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the corps of prisoners,\r\n      bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and stores, and Murat had\r\n      only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons. So\r\n      it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on.\r\n      But now something strange was happening to his troops.\nDespite news of the capture of theflèches, Napoleon saw that this was not\r\n      the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former battles.\r\n      He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him\r\n      experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and they\r\n      all shunned one another’s eyes—only a de Beausset could fail to\r\n      grasp the meaning of what was happening.\nBut Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a\r\n      battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts\r\n      had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that the least\r\n      accident might now—with the fight balanced on such a strained center—destroy\r\n      him and his army.\nWhen he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in\r\n      which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon, or\r\n      army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the\r\n      concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the\r\n      Russians still holding their ground—a terrible feeling like a\r\n      nightmare took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might\r\n      destroy him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left\r\n      wing, might break through his center, he himself might be killed by a\r\n      stray cannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only\r\n      considered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky\r\n      chances presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like a\r\n      dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him, and\r\n      raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows\r\n      should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and\r\n      limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in\r\n      his helplessness.\nThe news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French\r\n      army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool below\r\n      the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier approached\r\n      and suggested that they should ride along the line to ascertain the\r\n      position of affairs.\n“What? What do you say?” asked Napoleon. “Yes, tell them to bring me my\r\n      horse.”\nHe mounted and rode toward Semënovsk.\nAmid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through\r\n      which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly\r\n      or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before seen\r\n      such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of guns, that\r\n      had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave a peculiar\r\n      significance to the spectacle, as music does totableaux vivants. Napoleon\r\n      rode up the high ground at Semënovsk, and through the smoke saw ranks of\r\n      men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They were Russians.\nThe Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semënovsk village and its\r\n      knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth\r\n      clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous slaughter\r\n      which could be of no avail either to the French or the Russians. Napoleon\r\n      stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which Berthier had\r\n      aroused him. He could not stop what was going on before him and around him\r\n      and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him, and from its\r\n      lack of success this affair, for the first time, seemed to him unnecessary\r\n      and horrible.\nOne of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead the\r\n      Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon, exchanged\r\n      looks and smiled contemptuously at this general’s senseless offer.\nNapoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.\n“At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard\r\n      destroyed!” he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevárdino."

    "text": "On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat\r\n      Kutúzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no orders,\r\n      but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.\n“Yes, yes, do that,” he replied to various proposals. “Yes, yes: go, dear\r\n      boy, and have a look,” he would say to one or another of those about him;\r\n      or, “No, don’t, we’d better wait!” He listened to the reports that were\r\n      brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of\r\n      him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not\r\n      interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in something else—in\r\n      the expression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting. By\r\n      long years of military experience he knew, and with the wisdom of age\r\n      understood, that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of\r\n      thousands of others struggling with death, and he knew that the result of\r\n      a battle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the\r\n      place where the troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of\r\n      slaughtered men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the\r\n      army, and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his\r\n      power.\nKutúzov’s general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention, and\r\n      his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the\r\n      fatigue of his old and feeble body.\nAt eleven o’clock they brought him news that theflèchescaptured by\r\n      the French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagratión was wounded. Kutúzov\r\n      groaned and swayed his head.\n“Ride over to Prince Peter Ivánovich and find out about it exactly,” he\r\n      said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of Württemberg\r\n      who was standing behind him.\n“Will Your Highness please take command of the first army?”\nSoon after the duke’s departure—before he could possibly have\r\n      reached Semënovsk—his adjutant came back from him and told Kutúzov\r\n      that the duke asked for more troops.\nKutúzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhtúrov to take over the\r\n      command of the first army, and a request to the duke—whom he said he\r\n      could not spare at such an important moment—to return to him. When\r\n      they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff\r\n      officers congratulated him, Kutúzov smiled.\n“Wait a little, gentlemen,” said he. “The battle is won, and there is\r\n      nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to wait\r\n      before we rejoice.”\nBut he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.\nWhen Scherbínin came galloping from the left flank with news that the\r\n      French had captured theflèchesand the village of Semënovsk, Kutúzov,\r\n      guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbínin’s looks that the\r\n      news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking Scherbínin’s arm,\r\n      led him aside.\n“Go, my dear fellow,” he said to Ermólov, “and see whether something can’t\r\n      be done.”\nKutúzov was in Górki, near the center of the Russian position. The attack\r\n      directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several times\r\n      repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond Borodinó, and on\r\n      their left flank Uvárov’s cavalry had put the French to flight.\nToward three o’clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all who\r\n      came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him, Kutúzov\r\n      noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with the day’s\r\n      success—a success exceeding his expectations, but the old man’s\r\n      strength was failing him. Several times his head dropped low as if it were\r\n      falling and he dozed off. Dinner was brought him.\nAdjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince Andrew had\r\n      said, “the war should be extended widely,” and whom Bagratión so detested,\r\n      rode up while Kutúzov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from Barclay de\r\n      Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank. The\r\n      sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running back and\r\n      the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances, concluded\r\n      that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the commander\r\n      in chief with that news.\nKutúzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced\r\n      at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.\nWolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutúzov with a\r\n      half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his\r\n      cap.\nHe treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance\r\n      intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to\r\n      Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom he\r\n      was dealing with.“Der alte Herr”(as in their own set the\r\n      Germans called Kutúzov) “is making himself very comfortable,” thought\r\n      Wolzogen, and looking severely at the dishes in front of Kutúzov he began to report\r\n      to “the old gentleman” the position of affairs on the left flank as\r\n      Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood it.\n“All the points of our position are in the enemy’s hands and we cannot\r\n      dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away and it is\r\n      impossible to stop them,” he reported.\nKutúzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as if not\r\n      understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing “the old\r\n      gentleman’s” agitation, said with a smile:\n“I have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness what\r\n      I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder....”\n“You have seen? You have seen?...” Kutúzov shouted. Frowning and rising\r\n      quickly, he went up to Wolzogen.\n“How... how dare you!...” he shouted, choking and making a threatening\r\n      gesture with his trembling arms: “How dare you, sir, say that tome?You know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information\r\n      is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to me,\r\n      the commander in chief, than to him.”\nWolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutúzov interrupted him.\n“The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right flank.\r\n      If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what you don’t\r\n      know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform him of my firm\r\n      intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,” said Kutúzov sternly.\nAll were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of the\r\n      panting old general.\n“They are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army!\r\n      The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred soil\r\n      of Russia,” said Kutúzov crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed as his\r\n      eyes filled with tears.\nWolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently\r\n      aside, marveling at “the old gentleman’s” conceited stupidity.\n“Ah, here he is, my hero!” said Kutúzov to a portly, handsome, dark-haired\r\n      general who was just ascending the knoll.\nThis was Raévski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part\r\n      of the field of Borodinó.\nRaévski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and that\r\n      the French no longer ventured to attack.\nAfter hearing him, Kutúzov said in French:\n“Then you do not think,like some others, that we must retreat?”\n“On the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is always the\r\n      most stubborn who remain victors,” replied Raévski, “and in my opinion...”\n“Kaysárov!” Kutúzov called to his adjutant. “Sit down and write out the\r\n      order of the day for tomorrow. And you,” he continued, addressing another,\r\n      “ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.”\nWhile Kutúzov was talking to Raévski and dictating the order of the day,\r\n      Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to\r\n      have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given.\nKutúzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to be\r\n      written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal\r\n      responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.\nAnd by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains\r\n      throughout an army one and the same temper, known as “the spirit of the\r\n      army,” and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kutúzov’s words, his order\r\n      for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of the army\r\n      to the other.\nIt was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the\r\n      farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at\r\n      different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kutúzov had said,\r\n      but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was not\r\n      the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in the\r\n      commander in chief’s soul as in that of every Russian.\nAnd on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing\r\n      from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe,\r\n      the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited."

    "chapter": "CHAPTER XXXVI",
    "text": "Prince Andrew’s regiment was among the reserves which till after one\r\n      o’clock were stationed inactive behind Semënovsk, under heavy artillery\r\n      fire. Toward two o’clock the regiment, having already lost more than two\r\n      hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between\r\n      Semënovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished that day\r\n      and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns\r\n      was directed between one and two o’clock.\nWithout moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here\r\n      lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the\r\n      right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious\r\n      domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing\r\n      cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as if\r\n      to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which the\r\n      cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men were\r\n      torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being\r\n      dragged away and the wounded carried off.\nWith each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not\r\n      yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred\r\n      paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same\r\n      mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the\r\n      ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot\r\n      and the cry of “stretchers!” was heard. Most of the time, by their\r\n      officers’ order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his\r\n      shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight\r\n      again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished his\r\n      bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his\r\n      bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his\r\n      boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed\r\n      ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed\r\n      fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when\r\n      rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great\r\n      masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any\r\n      attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or\r\n      some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval were\r\n      heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by\r\n      occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was as\r\n      if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,\r\n      commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of\r\n      the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace.\r\n      “Hey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She’ll fall.... Ah,\r\n      they don’t see it!” came identical shouts from the ranks all along the\r\n      regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown\r\n      dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner in\r\n      front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell\r\n      close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted\r\n      aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But\r\n      such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had\r\n      been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale and\r\n      gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.\nPrince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up and\r\n      down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the meadow\r\n      beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back. There was\r\n      nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything went on of\r\n      itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded carried away,\r\n      and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the rear they returned\r\n      immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew, considering it his duty\r\n      to rouse the courage of the men and to set them an example, walked about\r\n      among the ranks, but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary\r\n      and that there was nothing he could teach them. All the powers of his\r\n      soul, as of every soldier there, were unconsciously bent on avoiding the\r\n      contemplation of the horrors of their situation. He walked along the\r\n      meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, and gazing at the dust that\r\n      covered his boots; now he took big strides trying to keep to the\r\n      footprints left on the meadow by the mowers, then he counted his steps,\r\n      calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to walk a\r\n      mile, then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that grew along a\r\n      boundary rut, rubbed them in his palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly\r\n      bitter scent. Nothing remained of the previous day’s thoughts. He thought\r\n      of nothing. He listened with weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds,\r\n      distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from the booming of the\r\n      reports, glanced at the tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first\r\n      battalion, and waited. “Here it comes... this one is coming our way\r\n      again!” he thought, listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden\r\n      region of smoke. “One, another! Again! It has hit....” He stopped and\r\n      looked at the ranks. “No, it has gone over. But this one has hit!” And\r\n      again he started trying to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A\r\n      whizz and a thud! Five paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth\r\n      and disappeared. A chill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks.\r\n      Probably many had been hit—a large crowd had gathered near the\r\n      second battalion.\n“Adjutant!” he shouted. “Order them not to crowd together.”\nThe adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.\r\n      From the other side a battalion commander rode up.\n“Look out!” came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird whirring\r\n      in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped with little\r\n      noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the battalion\r\n      commander’s horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it was right or\r\n      wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the major, and\r\n      galloped aside. The horse’s terror infected the men.\n“Lie down!” cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.\nPrince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him and\r\n      the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and the\r\n      meadow.\n“Can this be death?” thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new,\r\n      envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke that\r\n      curled up from the rotating black ball. “I cannot, I do not wish to die. I\r\n      love life—I love this grass, this earth, this air....” He thought\r\n      this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.\n“It’s shameful, sir!” he said to the adjutant. “What...”\nHe did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of\r\n      an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame, a\r\n      suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side,\r\n      raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran up to him.\r\n      From the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large\r\n      stain on the grass.\nThe militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the\r\n      officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,\r\n      breathing heavily and noisily.\n“What are you waiting for? Come along!”\nThe peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but he moaned\r\n      piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.\n“Pick him up, lift him, it’s all the same!” cried someone.\nThey again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.\n“Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My God!”—voices\r\n      among the officers were heard saying.\n“It flew a hair’s breadth past my ear,” said the adjutant.\nThe peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started\r\n      hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.\n“Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!” shouted an officer, seizing by their\r\n      shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly and jolting\r\n      the stretcher.\n“Get into step, Fëdor... I say, Fëdor!” said the foremost peasant.\n“Now that’s right!” said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into\r\n      step.\n“Your excellency! Eh, Prince!” said the trembling voice of Timókhin, who\r\n      had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.\nPrince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the\r\n      stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped.\n\nThe militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the wood,\r\n      where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of three tents\r\n      with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood. In the wood,\r\n      wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating oats from their\r\n      movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that fell.\r\n      Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently.\r\n      Around the tents, over more than five acres, bloodstained men in various\r\n      garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier\r\n      stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers\r\n      keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the\r\n      officers’ orders, the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and\r\n      gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what\r\n      was taking place before them. From the tents came now loud angry cries and\r\n      now plaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water, or to\r\n      point out those who were to be brought in next. The wounded men awaiting\r\n      their turn outside the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or\r\n      asked for vodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrew’s bearers, stepping\r\n      over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental\r\n      commander, close up to one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting\r\n      instructions. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not\r\n      make out what was going on around him. He remembered the meadow, the\r\n      wormwood, the field, the whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of\r\n      passionate love of life. Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and\r\n      talking loudly and attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome,\r\n      black-haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been\r\n      wounded in the head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to\r\n      his talk, a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.\n“We kickedhimout from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed\r\n      the King himself!” cried he, looking around him with eyes that glittered\r\n      with fever. “If only reserves had come up just then, lads, there wouldn’t\r\n      have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely....”\nLike all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with\r\n      shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. “But isn’t it all the\r\n      same now?” thought he. “And what will be there, and what has there been\r\n      here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in\r\n      this life I did not and do not understand.”"

    "text": "One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron, holding a\r\n      cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained\r\n      hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked about him, but\r\n      above the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a little respite.\r\n      After turning his head from right to left for some time, he sighed and\r\n      looked down.\n“All right, immediately,” he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince\r\n      Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.\nMurmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.\n“It seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a\r\n      chance!” remarked one.\nPrince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been\r\n      cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not make\r\n      out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all sides\r\n      and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted him. All\r\n      he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked, bleeding human\r\n      bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as a few weeks\r\n      previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled the dirty pond\r\n      beside the Smolénsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh, the samechair à\r\n      canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with horror, as by a\r\n      presentiment.\nThere were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and on\r\n      the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left alone\r\n      and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables.\r\n      On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by the\r\n      uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and a\r\n      spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.\n“Ooh, ooh, ooh!” grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy\r\n      snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth, he\r\n      began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing, and\r\n      prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were\r\n      crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.\r\n      His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely\r\n      familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest to\r\n      hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all the time\r\n      with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking convulsively. Two\r\n      doctors—one of whom was pale and trembling—were silently doing\r\n      something to this man’s other, gory leg. When he had finished with the\r\n      Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the spectacled doctor came up\r\n      to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.\nHe glanced at Prince Andrew’s face and quickly turned away.\n“Undress him! What are you waiting for?” he cried angrily to the dressers.\nHis very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince\r\n      Andrew’s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to\r\n      undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent down\r\n      over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to\r\n      someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to\r\n      lose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of his\r\n      thighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the wound\r\n      bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince Andrew\r\n      opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the lips,\r\n      and hurried away.\nAfter the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a\r\n      blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the\r\n      best and happiest moments of his life—especially his earliest\r\n      childhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning\r\n      over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the\r\n      pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness of life—returned to his\r\n      memory, not merely as something past but as something present.\nThe doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose\r\n      head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and trying\r\n      to quiet him.\n“Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!” his frightened moans could be\r\n      heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.\nHearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because he was\r\n      dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life, or because\r\n      of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or because he was\r\n      suffering and others were suffering and that man near him was groaning so\r\n      piteously—he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy\r\n      tears.\nThe wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood and\r\n      with the boot still on.\n“Oh! Oh, ooh!” he sobbed, like a woman.\nThe doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew from\r\n      seeing his face, moved away.\n“My God! What is this? Why is he here?” said Prince Andrew to himself.\nIn the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been\r\n      amputated, he recognized Anatole Kurágin. Men were supporting him in their\r\n      arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen lips\r\n      could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. “Yes, it is he!\r\n      Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,” thought\r\n      Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him. “What is\r\n      the connection of that man with my childhood and life?” he asked himself\r\n      without finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected memory from that\r\n      realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him. He remembered\r\n      Natásha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810, with\r\n      her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for\r\n      rapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than\r\n      ever, awoke in his soul. He now remembered the connection that existed\r\n      between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears\r\n      that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered everything, and ecstatic pity\r\n      and love for that man overflowed his happy heart.\nPrince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving\r\n      tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.\n“Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those who\r\n      hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on earth\r\n      and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understand—that is\r\n      what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me had I\r\n      lived. But now it is too late. I know it!”"

    "text": "The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,\r\n      together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty\r\n      generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the\r\n      consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an\r\n      unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the killed\r\n      and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of mind. This\r\n      day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of\r\n      mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness. He rode\r\n      hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the Shevárdino knoll, where\r\n      he sat on his campstool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim,\r\n      his nose red, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening, with downcast\r\n      eyes, to the sounds of firing. With painful dejection he awaited the end\r\n      of this action, in which he regarded himself as a participant and which he\r\n      was unable to arrest. A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the\r\n      better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt\r\n      in his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the\r\n      battlefield. The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the\r\n      possibility of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not\r\n      desire Moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more\r\n      glory?). The one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom.\r\n      But when he had been on the Semënovsk heights the artillery commander had\r\n      proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those\r\n      heights to strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of\r\n      Knyazkóvo. Napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be\r\n      brought to him of the effect those batteries produced.\nAn adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns had\r\n      been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they still\r\n      held their ground.\n“Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,” said the\r\n      adjutant.\n“They want more!...” said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.\n“Sire?” asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.\n“They want more!” croaked Napoleon frowning. “Let them have it!”\nEven before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for which\r\n      he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him, was\r\n      being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary\r\n      greatness, and again—as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is\r\n      doing something for itself—he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad,\r\n      gloomy, and inhuman role predestined for him.\nAnd not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience darkened\r\n      of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more\r\n      than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end of his life\r\n      could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the significance of his\r\n      actions which were too contrary to goodness and truth, too remote from\r\n      everything human, for him ever to be able to grasp their meaning. He could\r\n      not disavow his actions, belauded as they were by half the world, and so\r\n      he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and all humanity.\nNot only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men\r\n      killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he looked\r\n      at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and, deceiving\r\n      himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five\r\n      Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone did he write in a\r\n      letter to Paris that “the battle field was superb,” because fifty thousand\r\n      corpses lay there, but even on the island of St. Helena in the peaceful\r\n      solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure to an account of\r\n      the great deeds he had done, he wrote:\nThe Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times: it\r\n      was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and\r\n      security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.\nIt was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the beginning\r\n      of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out, full of\r\n      well-being and prosperity for all. The European system was already\r\n      founded; all that remained was to organize it.\nSatisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I too\r\n      should have had myCongressand myHoly Alliance. Those ideas were\r\n      stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have discussed our\r\n      interests like one family, and have rendered account to the peoples as\r\n      clerk to master.\nEurope would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people, and\r\n      anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the common\r\n      fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable rivers for\r\n      everybody, that the seas should be common to all, and that the great\r\n      standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards for the\r\n      sovereigns.\nOn returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent,\r\n      peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed her frontiers\r\n      immutable; all future wars purelydefensive, all aggrandizementantinational. I should have associated my son in the Empire; mydictatorshipwould have been finished, and his constitutional reign would\r\n      have begun.\nParis would have been the capital of the world, and the French the envy of\r\n      the nations!\nMy leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company with\r\n      the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to leisurely\r\n      visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple, every corner\r\n      of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs, and scattering\r\n      public buildings and benefactions on all sides and everywhere.\nNapoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner of\r\n      the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the\r\n      peoples’ welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by the\r\n      employment of power confer benefactions.\n“Of four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,” he wrote further of\r\n      the Russian war, “half were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,\r\n      Bavarians, Württembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and\r\n      Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third composed\r\n      of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine, Piedmontese, Swiss,\r\n      Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the Thirty-second Military\r\n      Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it included scarcely a hundred\r\n      and forty thousand who spoke French. The Russian expedition actually cost\r\n      France less than fifty thousand men; the Russian army in its retreat from\r\n      Vílna to Moscow lost in the various battles four times more men than the\r\n      French army; the burning of Moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand\r\n      Russians who died of cold and want in the woods; finally, in its march\r\n      from Moscow to the Oder the Russian army also suffered from the severity\r\n      of the season; so that by the time it reached Vílna it numbered only fifty\r\n      thousand, and at Kálisch less than eighteen thousand.”\nHe imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the\r\n      horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the whole\r\n      responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found\r\n      justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who\r\n      perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians."

    "text": "Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and various\r\n      uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the Davýdov family and to\r\n      the crown serfs—those fields and meadows where for hundreds of years\r\n      the peasants of Borodinó, Górki, Shevárdino, and Semënovsk had reaped\r\n      their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the dressing stations the\r\n      grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space of some three acres\r\n      around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and unwounded, with\r\n      frightened faces, dragged themselves back to Mozháysk from the one army\r\n      and back to Valúevo from the other. Other crowds, exhausted and hungry,\r\n      went forward led by their officers. Others held their ground and continued\r\n      to fire.\nOver the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of\r\n      bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a\r\n      mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood.\r\n      Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded,\r\n      on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: “Enough,\r\n      men! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?”\nTo the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest, it\r\n      began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to slaughter\r\n      one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the question arose in\r\n      every soul: “For what, for whom, must I kill and be killed?... You may go\r\n      and kill whom you please, but I don’t want to do so any more!” By\r\n      evening this thought had ripened in every soul. At any moment these men might\r\n      have been seized with horror at what they were doing and might have thrown\r\n      up everything and run away anywhere.\nBut though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of\r\n      what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off, some\r\n      incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and they\r\n      still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match, though\r\n      only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though they\r\n      stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood and\r\n      powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides,\r\n      crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done by the\r\n      will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued.\nAnyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have\r\n      said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would\r\n      disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have\r\n      said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the\r\n      French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made\r\n      that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out.\nThe Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the\r\n      French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to\r\n      Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning.\r\n      But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French from their\r\n      positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all the Russian\r\n      troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian army that had\r\n      not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their positions they\r\n      had lost ONE HALF of their army.\nThe French, with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen\r\n      years, with the assurance of Napoleon’s invincibility, with the\r\n      consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had lost\r\n      only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact, twenty\r\n      thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French who had\r\n      attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position ought to\r\n      have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to block the\r\n      road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been attained and\r\n      all their efforts and losses were in vain. But the French did not make\r\n      that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only have used his Old\r\n      Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have been won. To speak of\r\n      what would have happened had Napoleon sent his Guards is like talking of\r\n      what would happen if autumn became spring. It could not be. Napoleon did\r\n      not give his Guards, not because he did not want to, but because it could\r\n      not be done. All the generals, officers, and soldiers of the French army\r\n      knew it could not be done, because the flagging spirit of the troops would\r\n      not permit it.\nIt was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of\r\n      the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and soldiers\r\n      of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not, after all\r\n      their experience of previous battles—when after one tenth of such\r\n      efforts the enemy had fled—experienced a similar feeling of terror\r\n      before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly at\r\n      the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the\r\n      attacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is\r\n      defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called\r\n      standards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were\r\n      standing, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral\r\n      superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the\r\n      Russians at Borodinó. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal that\r\n      has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were\r\n      perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker by\r\n      one half, could help swerving. By impetus gained, the French army was\r\n      still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort on\r\n      the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound\r\n      it had received at Borodinó. The direct consequence of the battle of\r\n      Borodinó was Napoleon’s senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat along\r\n      the old Smolénsk road, the destruction of the invading army of five\r\n      hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on which at\r\n      Borodinó for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit had\r\n      been laid."

    "text": "Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind.\r\n      Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he\r\n      examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the same\r\n      time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division\r\n      of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a well-known,\r\n      so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that Achilles could\r\n      never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite of the fact that\r\n      he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By the time Achilles has\r\n      covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise, the tortoise\r\n      has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him: when Achilles has\r\n      covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered another one hundredth, and so\r\n      on forever. This problem seemed to the ancients insoluble. The absurd\r\n      answer (that Achilles could never overtake the tortoise) resulted from\r\n      this: that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements,\r\n      whereas the motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise was continuous.\nBy adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a\r\n      solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we have admitted\r\n      the conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical\r\n      progression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of\r\n      this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.\nA modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the\r\n      infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex problems of\r\n      motion which used to appear insoluble.\nThis modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing\r\n      with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small, and\r\n      so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity) and\r\n      thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid\r\n      when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining\r\n      continuous motion.\nIn seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens.\r\n      The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary\r\n      human wills, is continuous.\nTo understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history.\r\n      But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all those human\r\n      wills, man’s mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units. The first\r\n      method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous\r\n      events and examine it apart from others, though there is and can be nobeginningto any event, for one event always flows uninterruptedly from\r\n      another.\nThe second method is to consider the actions of some one man—a king\r\n      or a commander—as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills;\r\n      whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of\r\n      a single historic personage.\nHistorical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually\r\n      takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the\r\n      units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others, or\r\n      to assume abeginningof any phenomenon, or to say that the will of many\r\n      men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is in\r\n      itself false.\nIt needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions\r\n      drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some larger or\r\n      smaller unit as the subject of observation—as criticism has every\r\n      right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be\r\n      arbitrarily selected.\nOnly by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the\r\n      differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and\r\n      attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of\r\n      these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.\nThe first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an\r\n      extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave their customary\r\n      pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and\r\n      slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some\r\n      years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive\r\n      movement which first increases and then slackens. What was the cause of\r\n      this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.\nThe historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and\r\n      doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling\r\n      these sayings and doings “the Revolution”; then they give a detailed\r\n      biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him;\r\n      tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that is\r\n      why this movement took place and those are its laws.\nBut the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, but\r\n      plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, because in it\r\n      a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. The sum of human\r\n      wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and only the sum of those\r\n      wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.\n“But every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors;\r\n      every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great\r\n      men,” says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time\r\n      conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the\r\n      conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a\r\n      war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my watch\r\n      and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring church;\r\n      but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten,\r\n      I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the\r\n      position of the hands of the watch.\nWhenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see the\r\n      valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude that\r\n      the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of\r\n      the engine.\nThe peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks\r\n      are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is\r\n      budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when\r\n      the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding\r\n      of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the force of the wind\r\n      is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a coincidence of\r\n      occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life, and I see that\r\n      however much and however carefully I observe the hands of the watch, and\r\n      the valves and wheels of the engine, and the oak, I shall not discover the\r\n      cause of the bells ringing, the engine moving, or of the winds of spring.\r\n      To that I must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the\r\n      movement of steam, of the bells, and of the wind. History must do the\r\n      same. And attempts in this direction have already been made.\nTo study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our\r\n      observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and study\r\n      the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved.\r\n      No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way\r\n      toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is evident that\r\n      only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of\r\n      history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort\r\n      has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to\r\n      describing the actions of various kings, commanders, and ministers and\r\n      propounding the historians’ own reflections concerning these actions."

    "text": "The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The Russian army\r\n      and people avoided a collision till Smolénsk was reached, and again from\r\n      Smolénsk to Borodinó. The French army pushed on to Moscow, its goal, its\r\n      impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the velocity of a\r\n      falling body increases as it approaches the earth. Behind it were seven\r\n      hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead were a few dozen\r\n      miles separating it from its goal. Every soldier in Napoleon’s army felt\r\n      this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.\nThe more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred\r\n      of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and\r\n      consolidated. At Borodinó a collision took place. Neither army was broken\r\n      up, but the Russian army retreated immediately after the collision as\r\n      inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater\r\n      momentum, and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had\r\n      advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance, though the\r\n      collision had deprived it of all its force.\nThe Russians retreated eighty miles—to beyond Moscow—and the\r\n      French reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks after\r\n      that there was not a single battle. The French did not move. As a\r\n      bleeding, mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained inert in\r\n      Moscow for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back:\r\n      they made a dash for the Kalúga road, and (after a victory—for at\r\n      Málo-Yaroslávets the field of conflict again remained theirs) without\r\n      undertaking a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back to\r\n      Smolénsk, beyond Smolénsk, beyond the Berëzina, beyond Vílna, and farther\r\n      still.\nOn the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kutúzov and the whole\r\n      Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodinó was a victory.\r\n      Kutúzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare for a fresh\r\n      conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone, but\r\n      because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who had taken part\r\n      in the battle knew it.\nBut all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of\r\n      unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle proved\r\n      physically impossible.\nIt was impossibleto give battle before information had been collected,\r\n      the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition replenished, the slain\r\n      reckoned up, new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed,\r\n      and before the men had had food and sleep. And meanwhile, the very next\r\n      morning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself upon the\r\n      Russians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now seemingly\r\n      increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from its\r\n      aim. Kutúzov’s wish was to attack next day, and the whole army desired to\r\n      do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient, there\r\n      must also be a possibility of doing it, and that possibility did not\r\n      exist. It was impossible not to retreat a day’s march, and then in the\r\n      same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third day’s march,\r\n      and at last, on the first of September when the army drew near Moscow—despite\r\n      the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks—the force\r\n      of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond Moscow. And the troops\r\n      retired one more, last, day’s march, and abandoned Moscow to the enemy.\nFor people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made\r\n      by generals—as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may\r\n      imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle—the\r\n      questions present themselves: Why did Kutúzov during the retreat not do\r\n      this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Filí? Why\r\n      did he not retire at once by the Kalúga road, abandoning Moscow? and so\r\n      on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know, the\r\n      inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander\r\n      in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble\r\n      the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies\r\n      examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of troops on\r\n      this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our plans from\r\n      some given moment. A commander in chief is never dealing with thebeginningof any event—the position from which we always contemplate\r\n      it. The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting\r\n      events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an\r\n      event that is occurring. Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly\r\n      shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted\r\n      shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex\r\n      play of intrigues, worries, contingencies, authorities, projects,\r\n      counsels, threats, and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to\r\n      innumerable questions addressed to him, which constantly conflict with one\r\n      another.\nLearned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutúzov should\r\n      have moved his army to the Kalúga road long before reaching Filí, and that\r\n      somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander in\r\n      chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not one\r\n      proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based on\r\n      strategics and tactics, contradict each other.\nA commander in chief’s business, it would seem, is simply to choose one of\r\n      these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not wait.\r\n      For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the\r\n      Kalúga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from Milorádovich asking\r\n      whether he is to engage the French or retire. An order must be given him\r\n      at once, that instant. And the order to retreat carries us past the turn\r\n      to the Kalúga road. And after the adjutant comes the commissary general\r\n      asking where the stores are to be taken, and the chief of the hospitals\r\n      asks where the wounded are to go, and a courier from Petersburg brings a\r\n      letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of\r\n      abandoning Moscow, and the commander in chief’s rival, the man who is\r\n      undermining him (and there are always not merely one but several such),\r\n      presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the\r\n      Kalúga road, and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and\r\n      refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been\r\n      overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain, and the\r\n      inhabitants of the district pray to be defended, and an officer sent to\r\n      inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what\r\n      was said by the officer previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a\r\n      general who has been on reconnaissance, all describe the position of the\r\n      enemy’s army differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget\r\n      these inevitable conditions of a commander in chief’s actions describe to\r\n      us, for instance, the position of the army at Filí and assume that the\r\n      commander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide\r\n      whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army\r\n      less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had that\r\n      question been settled? At Drissa and at Smolénsk and most palpably of all\r\n      on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevárdino and on the twenty-sixth at\r\n      Borodinó, and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from Borodinó to\r\n      Filí."

    "text": "When Ermólov, having been sent by Kutúzov to inspect the position, told\r\n      the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow and\r\n      that they must retreat, Kutúzov looked at him in silence.\n“Give me your hand,” said he and, turning it over so as to feel the pulse,\r\n      added: “You are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you are saying!”\nKutúzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow\r\n      without a battle.\nOn the Poklónny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomílov gate of Moscow,\r\n      Kutúzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside. A\r\n      great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count Rostopchín, who had\r\n      come out from Moscow, joined them. This brilliant company separated into\r\n      several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the\r\n      position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the situation of\r\n      Moscow, and military questions generally. Though they had not been\r\n      summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt\r\n      that this was really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with\r\n      public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it was done\r\n      in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters. No jokes,\r\n      or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They evidently\r\n      all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation\r\n      demanded. And all these groups, while talking among themselves, tried to\r\n      keep near the commander in chief (whose bench formed the center of the\r\n      gathering) and to speak so that he might overhear them. The commander in\r\n      chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat\r\n      their remarks, but did not himself take part in the conversations or\r\n      express any opinion. After hearing what was being said by one or other of\r\n      these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment, as\r\n      though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some\r\n      discussed the position that had been chosen, criticizing not the position\r\n      itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others\r\n      argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have\r\n      been fought two days before. Others again spoke of the battle of\r\n      Salamanca, which was described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a\r\n      Spanish uniform. (This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving\r\n      with the Russian army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and\r\n      considering the possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.)\r\n      Count Rostopchín was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die\r\n      with the city train bands under the walls of the capital, but that he\r\n      still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was\r\n      happening, and that had he known it sooner things would have been\r\n      different.... A fifth group, displaying the profundity of their strategic\r\n      perceptions, discussed the direction the troops would now have to take. A\r\n      sixth group was talking absolute nonsense. Kutúzov’s expression grew more\r\n      and more preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing:\r\n      that to defend Moscow was aphysical impossibilityin the full meaning of\r\n      those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless\r\n      commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the\r\n      battle would still not take place. It would not take place because the\r\n      commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but in\r\n      their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its\r\n      inevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead their troops to a\r\n      field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade\r\n      officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the\r\n      position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced\r\n      as they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being\r\n      defended and others still discussed it, the question was no longer\r\n      important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue. This\r\n      Kutúzov knew well.\nBennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian\r\n      patriotism (Kutúzov could not listen to this without wincing) by insisting\r\n      that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight to Kutúzov:\r\n      if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kutúzov who had brought the\r\n      army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if it succeeded,\r\n      to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not given, to clear\r\n      himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this intrigue did not now\r\n      occupy the old man’s mind. One terrible question absorbed him and to that\r\n      question he heard no reply from anyone. The question for him now was:\r\n      “Have I really allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do so?\r\n      When was it decided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Plátov to\r\n      retreat, or was it the evening before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen\r\n      to issue orders? Or was it earlier still?... When, when was this terrible\r\n      affair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the\r\n      order to do so must be given.” To give that terrible order seemed to him\r\n      equivalent to resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love\r\n      power to which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince\r\n      Prozoróvski, under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was\r\n      convinced that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why,\r\n      against the Emperor’s wish and by the will of the people, he had been\r\n      chosen commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain\r\n      command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all the\r\n      world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and\r\n      he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But\r\n      something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which were\r\n      assuming too free a character must be stopped.\nHe called the most important generals to him.\n“My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,” said he, rising from\r\n      the bench, and he rode to Filí where his carriages were waiting."

    "text": "The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better\r\n      and roomier part of Andrew Savostyánov’s hut. The men, women, and children\r\n      of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across the passage.\r\n      Only Malásha, Andrew’s six-year-old granddaughter whom his Serene Highness\r\n      had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his\r\n      tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room. Malásha\r\n      looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces, uniforms, and\r\n      decorations of the generals, who one after another came into the room and\r\n      sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the icons. “Granddad”\r\n       himself, as Malásha in her own mind called Kutúzov, sat apart in a dark\r\n      corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep in a folding armchair, and\r\n      continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which,\r\n      though it was unbuttoned, still seemed to pinch his neck. Those who\r\n      entered went up one by one to the field marshal; he pressed the hands of\r\n      some and nodded to others. His adjutant Kaysárov was about to draw back\r\n      the curtain of the window facing Kutúzov, but the latter moved his hand\r\n      angrily and Kaysárov understood that his Serene Highness did not wish his\r\n      face to be seen.\nRound the peasant’s deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils, and\r\n      papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another\r\n      bench and put it beside the table. Ermólov, Kaysárov, and Toll, who had\r\n      just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost place, immediately\r\n      under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high forehead merging into his\r\n      bald crown. He had a St. George’s Cross round his neck and looked pale and\r\n      ill. He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain.\r\n      Beside him sat Uvárov, who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some\r\n      information, speaking in low tones as they all did. Chubby little\r\n      Dokhtúrov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded\r\n      on his stomach. On the other side sat Count Ostermann-Tolstóy, seemingly\r\n      absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad head with its bold features and\r\n      glittering eyes was resting on his hand. Raévski, twitching forward the\r\n      black hair on his temples as was his habit, glanced now at Kutúzov and now\r\n      at the door with a look of impatience. Konovnítsyn’s firm, handsome, and\r\n      kindly face was lit up by a tender, sly smile. His glance met Malásha’s,\r\n      and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to smile.\nThey were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting the\r\n      position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from four\r\n      till six o’clock and did not begin their deliberations all that time but\r\n      talked in low tones of other matters.\nOnly when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutúzov leave his corner and\r\n      draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been\r\n      placed there to light up his face.\nBennigsen opened the council with the question: “Are we to abandon\r\n      Russia’s ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to\r\n      defend it?” A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown on\r\n      every face and only Kutúzov’s angry grunts and occasional cough broke the\r\n      silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Malásha too looked at “Granddad.”\r\n       She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he seemed about to\r\n      cry, but this did not last long.\n“Russia’s ancient and sacred capital!”he suddenly said,\r\n      repeating Bennigsen’s words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention\r\n      to the false note in them. “Allow me to tell you, your excellency, that that\r\n      question has no meaning for a Russian.” (He lurched his heavy body\r\n      forward.) “Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question I\r\n      have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one. The\r\n      question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow without\r\n      a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as\r\n      Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion,” and he sank\r\n      back in his chair.\nThe discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.\r\n      Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at Filí\r\n      was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love of Moscow,\r\n      he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank during the\r\n      night and attack the French right flank the following day. Opinions were\r\n      divided, and arguments were advanced for and against that project.\r\n      Ermólov, Dokhtúrov, and Raévski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether feeling it\r\n      necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by\r\n      other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not to understand\r\n      that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that\r\n      Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other generals, however,\r\n      understood it and, leaving aside the question of Moscow, spoke of the\r\n      direction the army should take in its retreat. Malásha, who kept her eyes\r\n      fixed on what was going on before her, understood the meaning of the\r\n      council differently. It seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle\r\n      between “Granddad” and “Long-coat” as she termed Bennigsen. She saw that\r\n      they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another, and in her heart she\r\n      sided with “Granddad.” In the midst of the conversation she noticed\r\n      “Granddad” give Bennigsen a quick, subtle glance, and then to her joys she\r\n      saw that “Granddad” said something to “Long-coat” which settled him.\r\n      Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room. What\r\n      so affected him was Kutúzov’s calm and quiet comment on the advantage or\r\n      disadvantage of Bennigsen’s proposal to move troops by night from the\r\n      right to the left flank to attack the French right wing.\n“Gentlemen,” said Kutúzov, “I cannot approve of the count’s plan. Moving\r\n      troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military\r\n      history supports that view. For instance...” Kutúzov seemed to reflect,\r\n      searching for an example, then with a clear, naïve look at Bennigsen he\r\n      added: “Oh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count well\r\n      remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our troops\r\n      were rearranged too near the enemy....”\nThere followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.\nThe discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all\r\n      felt that there was no more to be said.\nDuring one of these pauses Kutúzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to\r\n      speak. They all looked at him.\n“Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken\r\n      crockery,” said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. “Gentlemen, I\r\n      have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,” he\r\n      paused, “by the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country,\r\n      order a retreat.”\nAfter that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and\r\n      circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.\nSome of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different from the\r\n      way they had spoken during the council, communicated something to their\r\n      commander in chief.\nMalásha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully\r\n      backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its\r\n      projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out\r\n      of the room.\nWhen he had dismissed the generals Kutúzov sat a long time with his elbows\r\n      on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question: “When, when\r\n      did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was that done which\r\n      settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?”\n“I did not expect this,” said he to his adjutant Schneider when the latter\r\n      came in late that night. “I did not expect this! I did not think this\r\n      would happen.”\n“You should take some rest, your Serene Highness,” replied Schneider.\n“But no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!” exclaimed Kutúzov\r\n      without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist. “They shall too,\r\n      if only...”"

    "text": "At that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating\r\n      without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow, Rostopchín,\r\n      who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event, acted in\r\n      an altogether different manner from Kutúzov.\nAfter the battle of Borodinó the abandonment and burning of Moscow was as\r\n      inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.\nEvery Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the feeling\r\n      implanted in each of us and in our fathers.\nThe same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns and\r\n      villages on Russian soil beginning with Smolénsk, without the\r\n      participation of Count Rostopchín and his broadsheets. The people awaited\r\n      the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to\r\n      pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to find what it\r\n      should do at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the enemy drew\r\n      near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property, while the\r\n      poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.\nThe consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is\r\n      present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this, and a\r\n      foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian Moscow\r\n      society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July and at the\r\n      beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who went away,\r\n      taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their\r\n      belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not\r\n      by phrases or by giving one’s children to save the fatherland and similar\r\n      unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore\r\n      in the way that always produces the most powerful results.\n“It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running away\r\n      from Moscow,” they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopchín impressed on\r\n      them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed to be called\r\n      cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing it had to be done.\r\n      Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that Rostopchín had scared\r\n      them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had committed in conquered\r\n      countries. The first people to go away were the rich educated people who\r\n      knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had remained intact and that during\r\n      Napoleon’s occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in\r\n      the company of the charming Frenchmen whom the Russians, and especially\r\n      the Russian ladies, then liked so much.\nThey went away because for Russians there could be no question as to\r\n      whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It was\r\n      out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing\r\n      that could happen. They went away even before the battle of Borodinó and\r\n      still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopchín’s calls to defend Moscow\r\n      or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of\r\n      the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were to\r\n      destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopchín wrote in his\r\n      broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, and that if it\r\n      could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to\r\n      the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that they must go\r\n      away, sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction. They\r\n      went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense\r\n      and wealthy city being given over to destruction, for a great city with\r\n      wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be\r\n      burned. They went away each on his own account, and yet it was only in\r\n      consequence of their going away that the momentous event was accomplished\r\n      that will always remain the greatest glory of the Russian people. The lady\r\n      who, afraid of being stopped by Count Rostopchín’s orders, had already in\r\n      June moved with her Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her\r\n      Sarátov estate, with a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparte’s\r\n      servant, was really, simply, and truly carrying out the great work which\r\n      saved Russia. But Count Rostopchín, who now taunted those who left Moscow\r\n      and now had the government offices removed; now distributed quite useless\r\n      weapons to the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the icons,\r\n      and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints;\r\n      now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and\r\n      thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by\r\n      Leppich; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set\r\n      fire to his own house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly\r\n      upbraiding them for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory\r\n      of having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed;\r\n      now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, and now\r\n      reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from\r\n      Moscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalmé (the center of the whole\r\n      French colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered the venerable old\r\n      postmaster Klyucharëv to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense;\r\n      now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French and now,\r\n      to get rid of them, handed over to them a man to be killed and himself\r\n      drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would not survive the fall\r\n      of Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share in\r\n      the affair—this man did not understand the meaning of what was\r\n      happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish\r\n      people, to perform some patriotically heroic feat; and like a child he\r\n      made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable event—the abandonment\r\n      and burning of Moscow—and tried with his puny hand now to speed and\r\n      now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him along with it."

    "text": "Hélène, having returned with the court from Vílna to Petersburg, found\r\n      herself in a difficult position.\nIn Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who\r\n      occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In Vílna she had formed\r\n      an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she returned to Petersburg\r\n      both the magnate and the prince were there, and both claimed their rights.\r\n      Hélène was faced by a new problem—how to preserve her intimacy with\r\n      both without offending either.\nWhat would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did\r\n      not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezúkhova, who evidently\r\n      deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had she attempted\r\n      concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by\r\n      cunning, she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself guilty.\r\n      But Hélène, like a really great man who can do whatever he pleases, at once\r\n      assumed her own position to be correct, as she sincerely believed it to\r\n      be, and that everyone else was to blame.\nThe first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her, she\r\n      lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: “That’s\r\n      just like a man—selfish and cruel! I expected nothing else. A woman\r\n      sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her reward! What\r\n      right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and\r\n      friendships? He is a man who has been more than a father to me!” The\r\n      prince was about to say something, but Hélène interrupted him.\n“Well, yes,” said she, “it may be that he has other sentiments for me than\r\n      those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door on him.\r\n      I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude! Know,\r\n      monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I render\r\n      account only to God and to my conscience,” she concluded, laying her hand\r\n      on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven.\n“But for heaven’s sake listen to me!”\n“Marry me, and I will be your slave!”\n“But that’s impossible.”\n“You won’t deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...” said Hélène,\r\n      beginning to cry.\nThe prince tried to comfort her, but Hélène, as if quite distraught, said\r\n      through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying, that\r\n      there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but she\r\n      mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had never\r\n      been her husband’s wife, and that she had been sacrificed.\n“But the law, religion...” said the prince, already yielding.\n“The law, religion... What have they been invented for if they can’t\r\n      arrange that?” said Hélène.\nThe prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him,\r\n      and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the Society of Jesus,\r\n      with whom he was on intimate terms.\nA few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Hélène gave at her\r\n      country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert, a man\r\n      no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes, a Jesuità\r\n      robe courte* was presented to her, and in the garden by the light of the\r\n      illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of\r\n      the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the consolations\r\n      the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and the next. Hélène\r\n      was touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of\r\n      Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance, for which her\r\n      partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with her futuredirecteur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de Jobert came to\r\n      see Hélène when she was alone, and after that often came again.\n* Lay member of the Society of Jesus.\nOne day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt\r\n      down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged\r\n      Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward\r\n      described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul.\r\n      It was explained to her that this wasla grâce.\nAfter that a long-frocked abbé was brought to her. She confessed to him,\r\n      and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box containing\r\n      the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to partake of. A few\r\n      days later Hélène learned with pleasure that she had now been admitted to\r\n      the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the Pope himself would\r\n      hear of her and would send her a certain document.\nAll that was done around her and to her at this time, all the attention\r\n      devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant,\r\n      refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore\r\n      only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure, but\r\n      her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim. And as it\r\n      always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better\r\n      of cleverer ones, Hélène—having realized that the main object of all\r\n      these words and all this trouble was, after converting her to Catholicism,\r\n      to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to which she received\r\n      indications)—before parting with her money insisted that the various\r\n      operations necessary to free her from her husband should be performed. In\r\n      her view the aim of every religion was merely to preserve certain\r\n      proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires. And with this\r\n      aim, in one of her talks with her Father Confessor, she insisted on an\r\n      answer to the question, in how far was she bound by her marriage?\nThey were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room. The\r\n      scent of flowers came in at the window. Hélène was wearing a white dress,\r\n      transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbé, a well-fed man with a\r\n      plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white hands meekly\r\n      folded on his knees, sat close to Hélène and, with a subtle smile on his\r\n      lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty, occasionally glanced at\r\n      her face as he explained his opinion on the subject. Hélène with an uneasy\r\n      smile looked at his curly hair and his plump, clean-shaven, blackish\r\n      cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn.\r\n      But the abbé, though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was\r\n      absorbed in his mastery of the matter.\nThe course of the Father Confessor’s arguments ran as follows: “Ignorant\r\n      of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow of conjugal\r\n      fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married state without\r\n      faith in the religious significance of marriage, committed an act of\r\n      sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had.\r\n      Yet in spite of this your vow was binding. You swerved from it. What did\r\n      you commit by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial sin, for you\r\n      acted without evil intention. If now you married again with the object of\r\n      bearing children, your sin might be forgiven. But the question is again a\r\n      twofold one: firstly...”\nBut suddenly Hélène, who was getting bored, said with one of her\r\n      bewitching smiles: “But I think that having espoused the true religion I\r\n      cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.”\nThe director of her conscience was astounded at having the case presented\r\n      to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus’ egg. He was delighted at the\r\n      unexpected rapidity of his pupil’s progress, but could not abandon the\r\n      edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.\n“Let us understand one another, Countess,” said he with a smile, and began\r\n      refuting his spiritual daughter’s arguments."

    "text": "Hélène understood that the question was very simple and easy from the\r\n      ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making\r\n      difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter\r\n      would be regarded by the secular authorities.\nSo she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society.\r\n      She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had\r\n      told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only way\r\n      for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly magnate\r\n      was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a\r\n      woman whose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but Hélène’s\r\n      imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a\r\n      maiden had its effect on him too. Had Hélène herself shown the least sign\r\n      of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would certainly have been\r\n      lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy or shame, on the\r\n      contrary, with good-natured naïveté she told her intimate friends (and\r\n      these were all Petersburg) that both the prince and the magnate had\r\n      proposed to her and that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either.\nA rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Hélène wanted to be\r\n      divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have\r\n      opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and\r\n      interesting Hélène was in doubt which of the two men she should marry. The\r\n      question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was the\r\n      better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There were, it\r\n      is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a\r\n      question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of\r\n      marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent, while the\r\n      majority were interested in Hélène’s good fortune and in the question\r\n      which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was right or wrong\r\n      to remarry while one had a husband living they did not discuss, for that\r\n      question had evidently been settled by people “wiser than you or me,” as\r\n      they said, and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk\r\n      exposing one’s stupidity and incapacity to live in society.\nOnly Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, who had come to Petersburg that summer\r\n      to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express an opinion\r\n      contrary to the general one. Meeting Hélène at a ball she stopped her in\r\n      the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said in her gruff voice:\r\n      “So wives of living men have started marrying again! Perhaps you think you\r\n      have invented a novelty? You have been forestalled, my dear! It was\r\n      thought of long ago. It is done in all the brothels,” and with these words\r\n      Márya Dmítrievna, turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening\r\n      gesture and glancing sternly round, moved across the room.\nThough people were afraid of Márya Dmítrievna she was regarded in\r\n      Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed,\r\n      and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing the\r\n      whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.\nPrince Vasíli, who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated\r\n      one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his daughter whenever\r\n      he chanced to see her:\n“Hélène, I have a word to say to you,” and he would lead her aside,\r\n      drawing her hand downward. “I have heard of certain projects concerning...\r\n      you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father’s heart rejoices to\r\n      know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my dear child, consult\r\n      only your own heart. That is all I have to say,” and concealing his\r\n      unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his daughter’s and move\r\n      away.\nBilíbin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man, and\r\n      who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as Hélène\r\n      always has—men friends who can never change into lovers—once\r\n      gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.\n“Listen, Bilíbin,” said Hélène (she always called friends of that sort by\r\n      their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white, beringed\r\n      fingers. “Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do. Which of the\r\n      two?”\nBilíbin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a smile\r\n      on his lips.\n“You are not taking me unawares, you know,” said he. “As a true friend, I\r\n      have thought and thought again about your affair. You see, if you marry\r\n      the prince”—he meant the younger man—and he crooked one\r\n      finger, “you forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will\r\n      displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of connection.)\r\n      But if you marry the old count you will make his last days happy, and as\r\n      widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making amésallianceby marrying you,” and Bilíbin smoothed out his forehead.\n“That’s a true friend!” said Hélène beaming, and again touching Bilíbin’s\r\n      sleeve. “But I love them, you know, and don’t want to distress either of\r\n      them. I would give my life for the happiness of them both.”\nBilíbin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could\r\n      help in that difficulty.\n“Une maîtresse-femme!* That’s what is called putting things squarely. She\r\n      would like to be married to all three at the same time,” thought he.\n* A masterly woman.\n“But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?” Bilíbin asked,\r\n      his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so\r\n      naïve a question. “Will he agree?”\n“Oh, he loves me so!” said Hélène, who for some reason imagined that\r\n      Pierre too loved her. “He will do anything for me.”\nBilíbin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.\n“Even divorce you?” said he.\nHélène laughed.\nAmong those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed\r\n      marriage was Hélène’s mother, Princess Kurágina. She was continually\r\n      tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned a\r\n      subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the\r\n      idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce and\r\n      remarriage during a husband’s lifetime, and the priest told her that it\r\n      was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel which\r\n      (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband is\r\n      alive.\nArmed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she drove\r\n      to her daughter’s early one morning so as to find her alone.\nHaving listened to her mother’s objections, Hélène smiled blandly and\r\n      ironically.\n“But it says plainly: ‘Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced...’”\r\n       said the old princess.\n“Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de bêtises. Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma\r\n      position j’ai des devoirs,”* said Hélène changing from Russian, in which\r\n      language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear, into\r\n      French which suited it better.\n* “Oh, Mamma, don’t talk nonsense! You don’t understand\r\n     anything. In my position I have obligations.”\n“But, my dear....”\n“Oh, Mamma, how is it you don’t understand that the Holy Father, who has\r\n      the right to grant dispensations...”\nJust then the lady companion who lived with Hélène came in to announce\r\n      that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.\n“Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse contre\r\n      lui, parce qu’il m’a manqué parole.”*\n* “No, tell him I don’t wish to see him, I am furious with\r\n     him for not keeping his word to me.”\n“Comtesse, à tout péché miséricorde,”* said a fair-haired young\r\n      man with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.\n* “Countess, there is mercy for every sin.”\nThe old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who had\r\n      entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and\r\n      sidled out of the room.\n“Yes, she is right,” thought the old princess, all her convictions\r\n      dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. “She is right, but how is it\r\n      that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so simple,”\r\n       she thought as she got into her carriage.\n\nBy the beginning of August Hélène’s affairs were clearly defined and she\r\n      wrote a letter to her husband—who, as she imagined, loved her very\r\n      much—informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having\r\n      embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the\r\n      formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to him by\r\n      the bearer of the letter.\nAnd so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful keeping—Your\r\n      friend Hélène.\nThis letter was brought to Pierre’s house when he was on the field of\r\n      Borodinó."

    "text": "Toward the end of the battle of Borodinó, Pierre, having run down from\r\n      Raévski’s battery a second time, made his way through a gully to Knyazkóvo\r\n      with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and seeing blood\r\n      and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in the crowds of\r\n      soldiers.\nThe one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly\r\n      from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return\r\n      to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed.\r\n      He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to\r\n      understand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such ordinary\r\n      conditions of life were nowhere to be found.\nThough shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he was\r\n      going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field of\r\n      battle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes\r\n      strangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiers’ overcoats,\r\n      the same sounds of firing which, though distant now, still aroused terror,\r\n      and besides this there were the foul air and the dust.\nHaving gone a couple of miles along the Mozháysk road, Pierre sat down by\r\n      the roadside.\nDusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on his\r\n      elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the\r\n      darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying\r\n      toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He had\r\n      no idea how long he had been there. In the middle of the night three\r\n      soldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began\r\n      lighting a fire.\nThe soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn\r\n      and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and\r\n      put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the\r\n      smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were eating\r\n      and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.\n“And who may you be?” one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently meaning\r\n      what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: “If you want to eat we’ll give\r\n      you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest man.”\n“I, I...” said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social\r\n      position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better\r\n      understood by them. “By rights I am a militia officer, but my men are not\r\n      here. I came to the battle and have lost them.”\n“There now!” said one of the soldiers.\nAnother shook his head.\n“Would you like a little mash?” the first soldier asked, and handed Pierre\r\n      a wooden spoon after licking it clean.\nPierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called the\r\n      food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food he\r\n      had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself to\r\n      large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by the\r\n      fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.\n“Where have you to go to? Tell us!” said one of them.\n“To Mozháysk.”\n“You’re a gentleman, aren’t you?”\n“Yes.”\n“And what’s your name?”\n“Peter Kirílych.”\n“Well then, Peter Kirílych, come along with us, we’ll take you there.”\nIn the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozháysk.\nBy the time they got near Mozháysk and began ascending the steep hill into\r\n      the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the\r\n      soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill and\r\n      that he had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered this,\r\n      such was his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the hill\r\n      stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the town and was\r\n      returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the darkness by his\r\n      white hat.\n“Your excellency!” he said. “Why, we were beginning to despair! How is it\r\n      you are on foot? And where are you going, please?”\n“Oh, yes!” said Pierre.\nThe soldiers stopped.\n“So you’ve found your folk?” said one of them. “Well, good-by, Peter\r\n      Kirílych—isn’t it?”\n“Good-by, Peter Kirílych!” Pierre heard the other voices repeat.\n“Good-by!” he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.\n“I ought to give them something!” he thought, and felt in his pocket. “No,\r\n      better not!” said another, inner voice.\nThere was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied. Pierre\r\n      went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay down in\r\n      his carriage."

    "text": "Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself\r\n      falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality, he\r\n      heard theboom, boom, boomof firing, the thud of projectiles, groans and\r\n      cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and dread of\r\n      death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his\r\n      head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only someone’s\r\n      orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked\r\n      to the innkeeper. Above Pierre’s head some pigeons, disturbed by the\r\n      movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof of the\r\n      penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of\r\n      stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see the clear\r\n      starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.\n“Thank God, there is no more of that!” he thought, covering up his head\r\n      again. “Oh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded to\r\n      it! But they...theywere steady and calm all the time, to the end...”\r\n       thought he.\nThey, in Pierre’s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the\r\n      battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before the\r\n      icon.They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out\r\n      clearly and sharply from everyone else.\n“To be a soldier, just a soldier!” thought Pierre as he fell asleep, “to\r\n      enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what they\r\n      are. But how to cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer\r\n      man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run away\r\n      from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve as a\r\n      soldier after the duel with Dólokhov.” And the memory of the dinner at the\r\n      English Club when he had challenged Dólokhov flashed through Pierre’s\r\n      mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzhók. And now a picture\r\n      of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind. It was\r\n      taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him sat at\r\n      the end of the table. “Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!”\r\n      thought Pierre. “Yes, he died, and I did not know he was alive. How sorry\r\n      I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive again!” On one side\r\n      of the table sat Anatole, Dólokhov, Nesvítski, Denísov, and others like\r\n      them (in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly\r\n      defined in his mind as the category of those he termedthey), and he heard\r\n      those people, Anatole and Dólokhov, shouting and singing loudly; yet\r\n      through their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all\r\n      the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as\r\n      the booming on the battlefield, but pleasant and comforting. Pierre did\r\n      not understand what his benefactor was saying, but he knew (the categories\r\n      of thoughts were also quite distinct in his dream) that he was talking of\r\n      goodness and the possibility of being whattheywere. Andtheywith their\r\n      simple, kind, firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But\r\n      though they were kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him.\r\n      Wishing to speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that\r\n      moment his legs grew cold and bare.\nHe felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak\r\n      had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre\r\n      opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but now\r\n      they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.\n“It is dawn,” thought Pierre. “But that’s not what I want. I want to hear\r\n      and understand my benefactor’s words.” Again he covered himself up with\r\n      his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there. There\r\n      were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that someone was\r\n      uttering or that he himself was formulating.\nAfterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that\r\n      someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that\r\n      day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think\r\n      and express his thoughts like that when awake.\n“To endure war is the most difficult subordination of man’s freedom to the\r\n      law of God,” the voice had said. “Simplicity is submission to the will of\r\n      God; you cannot escape from Him. Andtheyare simple.Theydo not talk,\r\n      but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden. Man can be\r\n      master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not fear it\r\n      possesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know his\r\n      limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went on\r\n      thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to unite\r\n      the meaning of all. To unite all?” he asked himself. “No, not to unite.\r\n      Thoughts cannot be united, but toharnessall these thoughts together is\r\n      what we need! Yes, onemust harnessthem,must harnessthem!”\r\n      he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these words and they alone\r\n      expressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented\r\n      him.\n“Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.”\n“Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!” some\r\n      voice was repeating. “We must harness, it is time to harness....”\nIt was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone straight\r\n      into Pierre’s face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which\r\n      soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were\r\n      passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with repugnance, and closing\r\n      his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat. “No, I don’t want that, I\r\n      don’t want to see and understand that. I want to understand what was\r\n      revealing itself to me in my dream. One second more and I should have\r\n      understood it all! But what am I to do? Harness, but how can I harness\r\n      everything?” and Pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had\r\n      seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed.\nThe groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer had\r\n      come with news that the French were already near Mozháysk and that our men\r\n      were leaving it.\nPierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on\r\n      foot through the town.\nThe troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them.\r\n      There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and the\r\n      streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that were to\r\n      take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could be heard.\r\n      Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken him, to a\r\n      wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the way Pierre\r\n      was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince\r\n      Andrew."

    "text": "On the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of\r\n      the city he was met by Count Rostopchín’s adjutant.\n“We have been looking for you everywhere,” said the adjutant. “The count\r\n      wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a\r\n      very important matter.”\nWithout going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow\r\n      commander in chief.\nCount Rostopchín had only that morning returned to town from his summer\r\n      villa at Sokólniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house were full\r\n      of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders. Vasílchikov and\r\n      Plátov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was\r\n      impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be surrendered.\r\n      Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants, the officials—the\r\n      heads of the various government departments—knew that Moscow would\r\n      soon be in the enemy’s hands, just as Count Rostopchín himself knew it,\r\n      and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to\r\n      ask how they were to deal with their various departments.\nAs Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came out\r\n      of Rostopchín’s private room.\nIn answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a\r\n      despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.\nWhile waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the\r\n      various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there.\r\n      They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of men,\r\n      one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their\r\n      conversation.\n“If they’re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,\r\n      but as things are now one can’t answer for anything.”\n“But you see what he writes...” said another, pointing to a printed sheet\r\n      he held in his hand.\n“That’s another matter. That’s necessary for the people,” said the first.\n“What is it?” asked Pierre.\n“Oh, it’s a fresh broadsheet.”\nPierre took it and began reading.\nHis Serene Highness has passed through Mozháysk in order to join up with\r\n      the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where the\r\n      enemy will not soon attack him. Forty-eight guns with ammunition have been\r\n      sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he will defend Moscow to\r\n      the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets. Do not\r\n      be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed; things have to be put\r\n      in order, and we will deal with villains in our own way! When the time\r\n      comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day\r\n      or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet so I hold my peace. An ax\r\n      will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged fork will be\r\n      best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after\r\n      dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the wounded\r\n      in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water blessed. That will\r\n      help them to get well quicker. I, too, am well now: one of my eyes was\r\n      sore but now I am on the lookout with both.\n“But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the\r\n      town,” said Pierre, “and that the position...”\n“Well, of course! That’s what we were saying,” replied the first speaker.\n“And what does he mean by ‘One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the\r\n      lookout with both’?” asked Pierre.\n“The count had a sty,” replied the adjutant smiling, “and was very much\r\n      upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him.\r\n      By the by, Count,” he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a smile, “we\r\n      heard that you have family troubles and that the countess, your wife...”\n“I have heard nothing,” Pierre replied unconcernedly. “But what have you\r\n      heard?”\n“Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I heard.”\n“But what did you hear?”\n“Well, they say,” continued the adjutant with the same smile, “that the\r\n      countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect it’s\r\n      nonsense....”\n“Possibly,” remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. “And who\r\n      is that?” he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant\r\n      overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face.\n“He? That’s a tradesman, that is to say, he’s the restaurant keeper,\r\n      Vereshchágin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the\r\n      proclamation.”\n“Oh, so that is Vereshchágin!” said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm face\r\n      of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.\n“That’s not he himself, that’s the father of the fellow who wrote the\r\n      proclamation,” said the adjutant. “The young man is in prison and I expect\r\n      it will go hard with him.”\nAn old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a\r\n      cross round his neck, approached the speaker.\n“It’s a complicated story, you know,” said the adjutant.\r\n      “That proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of\r\n      it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivánovich\r\n      here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly\r\n      sixty-three hands. He asked one, ‘From whom did you get it?’ ‘From\r\n      so-and-so.’ He went to the next one. ‘From whom did you get it?’\r\n      and so on till he reached Vereshchágin, a half educated tradesman, you know,\r\n      ‘a pet of a trader,’” said the adjutant smiling. “They\r\n      asked him, ‘Who gave it you?’ And the point is that we knew whom he had\r\n      it from. He could only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come\r\n      to some understanding. He replied: ‘From no one; I made it up myself.’\r\n      They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: ‘I made it\r\n      up myself.’ And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man.\r\n      ‘From whom did you get the proclamation?’ ‘I wrote it myself.’\r\n      Well, you know the count,” said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of\r\n      pride, “he flared up dreadfully—and just think of the fellow’s\r\n      audacity, lying, and obstinacy!”\n“And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharëv? I\r\n      understand!” said Pierre.\n“Not at all,” rejoined the adjutant in dismay. “Klyucharëv had\r\n      his own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished. But\r\n      the point is that the count was much annoyed. ‘How could you have written\r\n      it yourself?’ said he, and he took up the HamburgGazettethat was\r\n      lying on the table. ‘Here it is! You did not write it yourself but translated\r\n      it, and translated it abominably, because you don’t even know French, you\r\n      fool.’ And what do you think? ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have not\r\n      read any papers, I made it up myself.’ ‘If that’s so, you’re\r\n      a traitor and I’ll have you tried, and you’ll be hanged! Say from whom\r\n      you had it.’ ‘I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.’ And\r\n      that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to\r\n      it. He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the father\r\n      has come to intercede for him. But he’s a good-for-nothing lad! You know that\r\n      sort of tradesman’s son, a dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures\r\n      somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him. That’s the sort\r\n      of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge, and\r\n      you know there was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a scepter in\r\n      one hand and an orb in the other. Well, he took that icon home with him\r\n      for a few days and what did he do? He found some scoundrel of a\r\n      painter...”"

    "text": "In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in\r\n      chief.\nWhen he entered the private room Count Rostopchín, puckering his face, was\r\n      rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying\r\n      something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.\n“Ah, how do you do, great warrior?” said Rostopchín as soon as the short\r\n      man had left the room. “We have heard of your prowess. But that’s not the\r\n      point. Between ourselves,mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?”\r\n      he went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which he\r\n      nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. “I am well\r\n      informed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope that\r\n      you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin\r\n      Russia.”\n“Yes, I am a Mason,” Pierre replied.\n“There, you see,mon cher!I expect you know that Messrs. Speránski and\r\n      Magnítski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyucharëv has\r\n      been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of\r\n      building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of\r\n      their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and\r\n      that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful\r\n      person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage\r\n      for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from him\r\n      for safe custody. I like you and don’t wish you any harm and—as you\r\n      are only half my age—I advise you, as a father would, to cease all\r\n      communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as\r\n      possible.”\n“But what did Klyucharëv do wrong, Count?” asked Pierre.\n“That is for me to know, but not for you to ask,” shouted Rostopchín.\n“If he is accused of circulating Napoleon’s proclamation it is not proved\r\n      that he did so,” said Pierre without looking at Rostopchín, “and\r\n      Vereshchágin...”\n“There we are!” Rostopchín shouted at Pierre louder than before, frowning\r\n      suddenly. “Vereshchágin is a renegade and a traitor who will be punished\r\n      as he deserves,” said he with the vindictive heat with which people speak\r\n      when recalling an insult. “But I did not summon you to discuss my actions,\r\n      but to give you advice—or an order if you prefer it. I beg you to\r\n      leave the town and break off all communication with such men as\r\n      Klyucharëv. And I will knock the nonsense out of anybody”—but\r\n      probably realizing that he was shouting at Bezúkhov who so far was not\r\n      guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre’s hand in a friendly manner,\r\n      “We are on the eve of a public disaster and I haven’t time to be polite to\r\n      everybody who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl. Well,mon cher, what are you doing personally?”\n“Why, nothing,” answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the\r\n      thoughtful expression of his face.\nThe count frowned.\n“A word of friendly advice,mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, that’s\r\n      all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear\r\n      fellow. Oh, by the by!” he shouted through the doorway after Pierre, “is\r\n      it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers\r\n      of the Society of Jesus?”\nPierre did not answer and left Rostopchín’s room more sullen and angry\r\n      than he had ever before shown himself.\nWhen he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had\r\n      come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel of\r\n      his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners. They\r\n      all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre did not\r\n      understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only\r\n      answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone at last\r\n      he opened and read his wife’s letter.\n“They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old\r\n      man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the\r\n      meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One\r\n      must forget and understand...” And going to his bed he threw himself on it\r\n      without undressing and immediately fell asleep.\nWhen he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a\r\n      special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count Rostopchín to\r\n      know whether Count Bezúkhov had left or was leaving the town.\nA dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the\r\n      drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see them,\r\n      went to the back porch and out through the gate.\nFrom that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of\r\n      Bezúkhov’s household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again\r\n      or knew where he was."

    "text": "The Rostóvs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is, till\r\n      the eve of the enemy’s entry into the city.\nAfter Pétya had joined Obolénski’s regiment of Cossacks and left for\r\n      Bélaya Tsérkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized\r\n      with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both gone\r\n      from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them might\r\n      be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck her that\r\n      summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to get Nicholas\r\n      back and wished to go herself to join Pétya, or to get him an appointment\r\n      somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved possible. Pétya could\r\n      not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to\r\n      another regiment on active service. Nicholas was somewhere with the army\r\n      and had not sent a word since his last letter, in which he had given a\r\n      detailed account of his meeting with Princess Mary. The countess did not\r\n      sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons\r\n      lying dead. After many consultations and conversations, the count at last\r\n      devised means to tranquillize her. He got Pétya transferred from\r\n      Obolénski’s regiment to Bezúkhov’s, which was in training near Moscow.\r\n      Though Pétya would remain in the service, this transfer would give the\r\n      countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her\r\n      wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her Pétya so as not to let him\r\n      go again, but always get him appointed to places where he could not\r\n      possibly take part in a battle. As long as Nicholas alone was in danger\r\n      the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than all her\r\n      other children and even reproached herself for it; but when her youngest:\r\n      the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons, was always breaking things in\r\n      the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed\r\n      Pétya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was\r\n      just beginning to show—when he was thrown amid those big, dreadful,\r\n      cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently\r\n      finding pleasure in it—then his mother thought she loved him more,\r\n      much more, than all her other children. The nearer the time came for Pétya\r\n      to return, the more uneasy grew the countess. She began to think she would\r\n      never live to see such happiness. The presence of Sónya, of her beloved\r\n      Natásha, or even of her husband irritated her. “What do I want with them?\r\n      I want no one but Pétya,” she thought.\nAt the end of August the Rostóvs received another letter from Nicholas. He\r\n      wrote from the province of Vorónezh where he had been sent to procure\r\n      remounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that\r\n      one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about Pétya.\nThough by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostóvs’ acquaintances\r\n      had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to\r\n      get away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before her\r\n      treasure, her adored Pétya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August he\r\n      arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did\r\n      not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from him her\r\n      intention of keeping him under her wing, Pétya guessed her designs, and\r\n      instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her—might\r\n      “become womanish” as he termed it to himself—he treated her coldly,\r\n      avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached himself exclusively to\r\n      Natásha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness,\r\n      almost lover-like.\nOwing to the count’s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their\r\n      departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to come\r\n      from their Ryazán and Moscow estates to remove their household belongings\r\n      did not arrive till the thirtieth.\nFrom the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle\r\n      and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodinó were brought\r\n      in by the Dorogomílov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow, and\r\n      thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by\r\n      the other gates. In spite of Rostopchín’s broadsheets, or because of them\r\n      or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory rumors were\r\n      current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the\r\n      city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of\r\n      the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave. Some said there had\r\n      been another battle after Borodinó at which the French had been routed,\r\n      while others on the contrary reported that the Russian army had been\r\n      destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the\r\n      clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin had\r\n      been forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the peasants\r\n      were rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and so on. But\r\n      all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of Filí, at which\r\n      it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been held) both those who\r\n      went away and those who remained behind felt, though they did not show it,\r\n      that Moscow would certainly be abandoned, and that they ought to get away\r\n      as quickly as possible and save their belongings. It was felt that\r\n      everything would suddenly break up and change, but up to the first of\r\n      September nothing had done so. As a criminal who is being led to execution\r\n      knows that he must die immediately, but yet looks about him and\r\n      straightens the cap that is awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily\r\n      continued its wonted life, though it knew that the time of its destruction\r\n      was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed\r\n      to submit would be completely upset.\nDuring the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole Rostóv\r\n      family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the family, Count\r\n      Ilyá Rostóv, continually drove about the city collecting the current\r\n      rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about\r\n      the preparations for their departure.\nThe countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with\r\n      everything, was constantly in pursuit of Pétya who was always running away\r\n      from her, and was jealous of Natásha with whom he spent all his time.\r\n      Sónya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things\r\n      packed. But of late Sónya had been particularly sad and silent. Nicholas’\r\n      letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in her presence,\r\n      joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention of Providence\r\n      in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.\n“I was never pleased at Bolkónski’s engagement to Natásha,” said the\r\n      countess, “but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a\r\n      presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!”\nSónya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving the\r\n      Rostóvs’ affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the\r\n      princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite her\r\n      grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the\r\n      difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and\r\n      was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they\r\n      had any orders to give. Pétya and Natásha on the contrary, far from\r\n      helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to\r\n      everyone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet,\r\n      their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not\r\n      because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were\r\n      in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and\r\n      laughter to them. Pétya was in high spirits because having left home a boy\r\n      he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine young man, because he was\r\n      at home, because he had left Bélaya Tsérkov where there was no hope of\r\n      soon taking part in a battle and had come to Moscow where there was to be\r\n      fighting in a few days, and chiefly because Natásha, whose lead he always\r\n      followed, was in high spirits. Natásha was gay because she had been sad\r\n      too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness, and\r\n      because she was feeling well. She was also happy because she had someone\r\n      to adore her: the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her\r\n      machine needed to make them run freely—and Pétya adored her. Above\r\n      all, they were gay because there was a war near Moscow, there would be\r\n      fighting at the town gates, arms were being given out, everybody was\r\n      escaping—going away somewhere, and in general something\r\n      extraordinary was happening, and that is always exciting, especially to\r\n      the young."

    "text": "On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the Rostóvs’ house\r\n      seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was being\r\n      carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been taken\r\n      down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and ropes\r\n      were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out the things\r\n      were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was crowded with\r\n      peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up, others still empty.\nThe voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had\r\n      come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard\r\n      and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The countess had a\r\n      headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down in the\r\n      new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head. Pétya was not at\r\n      home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a\r\n      transfer from the militia to the active army. Sónya was in the ballroom\r\n      looking after the packing of the glass and china. Natásha was sitting on\r\n      the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn\r\n      all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the\r\n      old ball dress (already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first\r\n      Petersburg ball.\nNatásha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and\r\n      several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was not\r\n      in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with\r\n      all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside Sónya\r\n      while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave it up\r\n      and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it amusing\r\n      to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was done and\r\n      what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.\n“Dunyásha, you pack! You will, won’t you, dear?” And when Dunyásha\r\n      willingly promised to do it all for her, Natásha sat down on the floor,\r\n      took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what\r\n      ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie\r\n      by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the\r\n      sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Natásha got up\r\n      and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of\r\n      wounded men had stopped in the street.\nThe housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,\r\n      postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.\nNatásha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an\r\n      end of it in each hand, went out into the street.\nThe former housekeeper, old Mávra Kuzmínichna, had stepped out of the\r\n      crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats,\r\n      and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside. Natásha moved a\r\n      few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her handkerchief, and\r\n      listened to what the housekeeper was saying.\n“Then you have nobody in Moscow?” she was saying. “You would be more\r\n      comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family\r\n      are leaving.”\n“I don’t know if it would be allowed,” replied the officer in a weak\r\n      voice. “Here is our commanding officer... ask him,” and he pointed to a\r\n      stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.\nNatásha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer\r\n      and at once went to meet the major.\n“May the wounded men stay in our house?” she asked.\nThe major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.\n“Which one do you want, Ma’am’selle?” said he, screwing up his eyes and\r\n      smiling.\nNatásha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner were\r\n      so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief,\r\n      that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection—as if\r\n      considering in how far the thing was possible—replied in the\r\n      affirmative.\n“Oh yes, why not? They may,” he said.\nWith a slight inclination of her head, Natásha stepped back quickly to\r\n      Mávra Kuzmínichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.\n“They may. He says they may!” whispered Natásha.\nThe cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostóvs’ yard, and\r\n      dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk\r\n      to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in\r\n      Povarskáya Street. Natásha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new\r\n      people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and Mávra Kuzmínichna\r\n      tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard.\n“Your Papa must be told, though,” said Mávra Kuzmínichna.\n“Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move into\r\n      the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.”\n“There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we put\r\n      them into the wing, the men’s room, or the nurse’s room, we must ask\r\n      permission.”\n“Well, I’ll ask.”\nNatásha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door\r\n      into the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman’s\r\n      drops.\n“Are you asleep, Mamma?”\n“Oh, what sleep—?” said the countess, waking up just as\r\n      she was dropping into a doze.\n“Mamma darling!” said Natásha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her\r\n      face close to her mother’s, “I am sorry, forgive me, I’ll never do it\r\n      again; I woke you up! Mávra Kuzmínichna has sent me: they have brought\r\n      some wounded here—officers. Will you let them come? They have\r\n      nowhere to go. I knew you’d let them come!” she said quickly all in one\r\n      breath.\n“What officers? Whom have they brought? I don’t understand anything about\r\n      it,” said the countess.\nNatásha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.\n“I knew you’d give permission... so I’ll tell them,” and, having kissed\r\n      her mother, Natásha got up and went to the door.\nIn the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.\n“We’ve stayed too long!” said the count with involuntary\r\n      vexation. “The Club is closed and the police are leaving.”\n“Papa, is it all right—I’ve invited some of the wounded into the\r\n      house?” said Natásha.\n“Of course it is,” he answered absently. “That’s not the point. I beg you\r\n      not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we must\r\n      go, go, go!...”\nAnd the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.\nAt dinner Pétya having returned home told them the news he had heard. He\r\n      said the people had been getting arms in the Krémlin, and that though\r\n      Rostopchín’s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three\r\n      days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone\r\n      to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big\r\n      battle there.\nThe countess looked with timid horror at her son’s eager, excited face as\r\n      he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not going to\r\n      the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement)\r\n      he would say something about men, honor, and the fatherland—something\r\n      senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there would be no contradicting,\r\n      and her plans would be spoiled; and so, hoping to arrange to leave before\r\n      then and take Pétya with her as their protector and defender, she did not\r\n      answer him, but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with\r\n      tears to take her away quickly, that very night if possible. With a\r\n      woman’s involuntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any\r\n      alarm, said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very\r\n      night. Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything."

    "text": "Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the\r\n      countess’ fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit\r\n      dealer’s in Myasnítski Street. When returning by that street she had been\r\n      unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop.\r\n      She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had\r\n      told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink\r\n      store, having received orders to do so.\nAfter dinner the whole Rostóv household set to work with enthusiastic\r\n      haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The old\r\n      count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the house\r\n      and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people, and\r\n      flurrying them still more. Pétya directed things in the yard. Sónya, owing\r\n      to the count’s contradictory orders, lost her head and did not know what\r\n      to do. The servants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and\r\n      disputing. Natásha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly\r\n      set to work too. At first her intervention in the business of packing was\r\n      received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and did not\r\n      wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience,\r\n      grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her, and at last\r\n      succeeded in making them believe her. Her first exploit, which cost her\r\n      immense effort and established her authority, was the packing of the\r\n      carpets. The count had valuable Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in\r\n      the house. When Natásha set to work two cases were standing open in the\r\n      ballroom, one almost full up with crockery, the other with carpets. There\r\n      was also much china standing on the tables, and still more was being\r\n      brought in from the storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had\r\n      gone to fetch it.\n“Sónya, wait a bit—we’ll pack everything into these,” said Natásha.\n“You can’t, Miss, we have tried to,” said the butler’s assistant.\n“No, wait a minute, please.”\nAnd Natásha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped\r\n      in paper.\n“The dishes must go in here among the carpets,” said she.\n“Why, it’s a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,” said\r\n      the butler’s assistant.\n“Oh, wait, please!” And Natásha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the\r\n      things. “These aren’t needed,” said she, putting aside some plates of Kiev\r\n      ware. “These—yes, these must go among the carpets,” she said,\r\n      referring to the Saxony china dishes.\n“Don’t, Natásha! Leave it alone! We’ll get it all packed,” urged Sónya\r\n      reproachfully.\n“What a young lady she is!” remarked the major-domo.\nBut Natásha would not give in. She turned everything out and began quickly\r\n      repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and unnecessary\r\n      crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had been taken out of\r\n      the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned out that when the\r\n      cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected, the valuable\r\n      ones really did all go into the two cases. Only the lid of the case\r\n      containing the carpets would not shut down. A few more things might have\r\n      been taken out, but Natásha insisted on having her own way. She packed,\r\n      repacked, pressed, made the butler’s assistant and Pétya—whom she\r\n      had drawn into the business of packing—press on the lid, and made\r\n      desperate efforts herself.\n“That’s enough, Natásha,” said Sónya. “I see you were right, but just take\r\n      out the top one.”\n“I won’t!” cried Natásha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung\r\n      over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the\r\n      carpets. “Now press, Pétya! Press, Vasílich, press hard!” she cried.\nThe carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natásha, clapping her hands,\r\n      screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only lasted a\r\n      moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her\r\n      completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that Natásha\r\n      had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her to ask\r\n      whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might be corded up.\r\n      Thanks to Natásha’s directions the work now went on expeditiously,\r\n      unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable packed as compactly as\r\n      possible.\nBut hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not get\r\n      everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count, having\r\n      put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.\nSónya and Natásha slept in the sitting room without undressing.\nThat night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskáya, and Mávra\r\n      Kuzmínichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the\r\n      Rostóvs’ yard. Mávra Kuzmínichna concluded that he was a very important\r\n      man. He was being conveyed in acalèchewith a raised hood, and was quite\r\n      covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable old\r\n      attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart.\n“Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house will\r\n      be empty,” said the old woman to the old attendant.\n“Well, perhaps,” said he with a sigh. “We don’t expect to get him home\r\n      alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it’s a long way from\r\n      here, and there’s nobody living in it.”\n“Do us the honor to come in, there’s plenty of everything in the master’s\r\n      house. Come in,” said Mávra Kuzmínichna. “Is he very ill?” she asked.\nThe attendant made a hopeless gesture.\n“We don’t expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.”\nAnd the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.\n“All right!” said the doctor.\nThe old servant returned to thecalèche, looked into it, shook his head\r\n      disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped beside\r\n      Mávra Kuzmínichna.\n“O, Lord Jesus Christ!” she murmured.\nShe invited them to take the wounded man into the house.\n“The masters won’t object...” she said.\nBut they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him into\r\n      the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss’.\nThis wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkónski."

    "text": "Moscow’s last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.\r\n      The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on\r\n      Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.\nOnly two things indicated the social condition of Moscow—the rabble,\r\n      that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd\r\n      of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials,\r\n      seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to the\r\n      Three Hills. Having waited there for Rostopchín who did not turn up, they\r\n      became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then dispersed all\r\n      about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day\r\n      indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts\r\n      and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and city articles\r\n      kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of carters removing\r\n      valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what\r\n      they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each,\r\n      and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being given away for nothing.\nIn the Rostóvs’ staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former\r\n      conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only\r\n      indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the\r\n      night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their possessions,\r\n      the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which\r\n      many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered\r\n      enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge sums offered for the\r\n      horses and carts, but on the previous evening and early in the morning of\r\n      the first of September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers\r\n      came to the Rostóvs’ and wounded men dragged themselves there from the\r\n      Rostóvs’ and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated,\r\n      entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The\r\n      major-domo to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry\r\n      for the wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention\r\n      the matter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was\r\n      evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to\r\n      refuse another, or all the carts and one’s own carriages as well. Thirty\r\n      carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one\r\n      could not disregard oneself and one’s own family. So thought the\r\n      major-domo on his master’s behalf.\nOn waking up that morning Count Ilyá Rostóv left his bedroom softly, so as\r\n      not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning, and\r\n      came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard stood\r\n      the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch. The\r\n      major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale\r\n      young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the major-domo made\r\n      a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.\n“Well, Vasílich, is everything ready?” asked the count, and stroking his\r\n      bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and\r\n      nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)\n“We can harness at once, your excellency.”\n“Well, that’s right. As soon as the countess wakes we’ll be off, God\r\n      willing! What is it, gentlemen?” he added, turning to the officer. “Are\r\n      you staying in my house?”\nThe officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.\n“Count, be so good as to allow me... for God’s sake, to get into some\r\n      corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be\r\n      all right on a loaded cart....”\nBefore the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request\r\n      on behalf of his master.\n“Oh, yes, yes, yes!” said the count hastily. “I shall be very pleased,\r\n      very pleased. Vasílich, you’ll see to it. Just unload one or two carts.\r\n      Well, what of it... do what’s necessary...” said the count, muttering some\r\n      indefinite order.\nBut at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer’s\r\n      face had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the\r\n      yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and their\r\n      orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and moving\r\n      toward the porch.\n“Please step into the gallery, your excellency,” said the major-domo.\r\n      “What are your orders about the pictures?”\nThe count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to refuse\r\n      the wounded who asked for a lift.\n“Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,” he added in a\r\n      soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.\nAt nine o’clock the countess woke up, and Matrëna Timoféevna, who had been\r\n      her lady’s maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief\r\n      gendarme’s duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much offended\r\n      and the young ladies’ summer dresses could not be left behind. On inquiry,\r\n      the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because her trunk had\r\n      been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were being uncorded and\r\n      the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the\r\n      count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take\r\n      with them. The countess sent for her husband.\n“What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.”\n“You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer came\r\n      to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are things\r\n      that can be bought but think what being left behind means to them!...\r\n      Really now, in our own yard—we asked them in ourselves and there are\r\n      officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them be taken...\r\n      where’s the hurry?”\nThe count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters.\r\n      The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of\r\n      something detrimental to the children’s interests, such as the building of\r\n      a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater or an\r\n      orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that\r\n      timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.\nShe assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:\r\n      “Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting\r\n      nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our—allthe children’sproperty! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand\r\n      rubles’ worth of things in the house. I don’t consent, my dear, I don’t!\r\n      Do as you please! It’s the government’s business to look after the\r\n      wounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukhíns opposite, they cleared out\r\n      everything two days ago. That’s what other people do. It’s only we who are\r\n      such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the children.”\nFlourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying.\n“Papa, what are you doing that for?” asked Natásha, who had followed him\r\n      into her mother’s room.\n“Nothing! What business is it of yours?” muttered the count angrily.\n“But I heard,” said Natásha. “Why does Mamma object?”\n“What business is it of yours?” cried the count.\nNatásha stepped up to the window and pondered.\n“Papa! Here’s Berg coming to see us,” said she, looking out of the window."

    "text": "Berg, the Rostóvs’ son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders of\r\n      Vladímir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of\r\n      assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first\r\n      division of the Second Army.\nOn the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.\nHe had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the\r\n      army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there.\r\n      So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and\r\n      domestic reasons.\nBerg drove up to his father-in-law’s house in his spruce little trap with\r\n      a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He looked\r\n      attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took\r\n      out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.\nFrom the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the\r\n      drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Natásha and\r\n      Sónya, and hastened to inquire after “Mamma’s” health.\n“Health, at a time like this?” said the count. “Come, tell us the news! Is\r\n      the army retreating or will there be another battle?”\n“God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,” said\r\n      Berg. “The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so to\r\n      say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But in\r\n      general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly antique\r\n      valor of the Russian army, which they—which it” (he corrected\r\n      himself) “has shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth—there\r\n      are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa” (he smote himself\r\n      on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but Berg did it\r\n      a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words “Russian\r\n      army”), “I tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far from having to\r\n      urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those...\r\n      those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,” he went on rapidly.\r\n      “General Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the\r\n      troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a hillside. You can\r\n      imagine!”\nAnd Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard\r\n      those days. Natásha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him, as\r\n      if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question.\n“Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors cannot\r\n      be imagined or adequately praised!” said Berg, glancing round at Natásha,\r\n      and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent look with a\r\n      smile. “‘Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of her sons!’\r\n      Isn’t it so, Papa?” said he.\nJust then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and\r\n      dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand, asked\r\n      about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to express\r\n      sympathy, remained standing beside her.\n“Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for\r\n      every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get\r\n      away....”\n“I can’t think what the servants are about,” said the countess, turning to\r\n      her husband. “I have just been told that nothing is ready yet. Somebody\r\n      after all must see to things. One misses Mítenka at such times. There\r\n      won’t be any end to it.”\nThe count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself. He\r\n      got up from his chair and went to the door.\nAt that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and,\r\n      seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and significantly.\n“And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,” said he.\n“Hm...” said the count, and stopped.\n“I was driving past Yusúpov’s house just now,” said Berg with a laugh,\r\n      “when the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldn’t\r\n      buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a small\r\n      chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear Véra wanted a\r\n      chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.” (At the mention\r\n      of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone\r\n      to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) “And it’s such\r\n      a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know! And dear\r\n      Véra has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you see. I saw so\r\n      many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me have one, I will\r\n      pay the man well, and...”\nThe count frowned and coughed.\n“Ask the countess, I don’t give orders.”\n“If it’s inconvenient, please don’t,” said Berg. “Only I so wanted it, for\r\n      dear Véra’s sake.”\n“Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil...”\r\n       cried the old count. “My head’s in a whirl!”\nAnd he left the room. The countess began to cry.\n“Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!” said Berg.\nNatásha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to\r\n      reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.\nPétya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who\r\n      were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the yard.\r\n      Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one\r\n      of them helped by an orderly.\n“Do you know what it’s about?” Pétya asked Natásha.\nShe understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about. She\r\n      did not answer.\n“It’s because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded,” said\r\n      Pétya. “Vasílich told me. I consider...”\n“I consider,” Natásha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to\r\n      Pétya, “I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I don’t know what.\r\n      Are we despicable Germans?”\nHer throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and\r\n      letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed\r\n      headlong up the stairs.\nBerg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful\r\n      attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down\r\n      the room, when Natásha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a\r\n      tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.\n“It’s horrid! It’s abominable!” she screamed. “You can’t possibly have\r\n      ordered it!”\nBerg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count\r\n      stood still at the window and listened.\n“Mamma, it’s impossible: see what is going on in the yard!” she cried.\r\n      “They will be left!...”\n“What’s the matter with you? Who are ‘they’? What do you want?”\n“Why, the wounded! It’s impossible, Mamma. It’s monstrous!... No, Mamma\r\n      darling, it’s not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what\r\n      does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the\r\n      yard... Mamma!... It’s impossible!”\nThe count stood by the window and listened without turning round. Suddenly\r\n      he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.\nThe countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her\r\n      mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn to\r\n      look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.\n“Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?” she said, not surrendering at\r\n      once.\n“Mamma, darling, forgive me!”\nBut the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.\n“My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don’t understand about\r\n      it,” said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.\n“The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,” muttered the count through\r\n      tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of\r\n      shame on his breast.\n“Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...” asked Natásha. “We will still\r\n      take all the most necessary things.”\nThe count nodded affirmatively, and Natásha, at the rapid pace at which\r\n      she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the\r\n      anteroom and downstairs into the yard.\nThe servants gathered round Natásha, but could not believe the strange\r\n      order she brought them until the count himself, in his wife’s name,\r\n      confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the\r\n      trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants set\r\n      to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed\r\n      strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be\r\n      done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to\r\n      anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away\r\n      but that had seemed the only thing to do.\nThe whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set\r\n      eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The\r\n      wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but\r\n      happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread to\r\n      the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the\r\n      Rostóvs’ yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but\r\n      only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of unloading,\r\n      once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter whether all\r\n      or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes,\r\n      pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before\r\n      now lay about the yard, and still they went on searching for and finding\r\n      possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have\r\n      another and yet another cart.\n“We can take four more men,” said the steward. “They can have my trap, or\r\n      else what is to become of them?”\n“Let them have my wardrobe cart,” said the countess. “Dunyásha can go with\r\n      me in the carriage.”\nThey unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a\r\n      house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright\r\n      and animated. Natásha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she\r\n      had not known for a long time.\n“What could we fasten this onto?” asked the servants, trying to fix a\r\n      trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. “We must keep at least\r\n      one cart.”\n“What’s in it?” asked Natásha.\n“The count’s books.”\n“Leave it, Vasílich will put it away. It’s not wanted.”\nThe phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count\r\n      Peter could sit.\n“On the box. You’ll sit on the box, won’t you, Pétya?” cried Natásha.\nSónya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite\r\n      different from Natásha’s. She was putting away the things that had to be\r\n      left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she\r\n      tried to get as much taken away with them as possible."

    "text": "Before two o’clock in the afternoon the Rostóvs’ four carriages, packed\r\n      full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one\r\n      the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.\nThecalèchein which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sónya’s\r\n      attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was\r\n      arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the\r\n      entrance.\n“Whosecalècheis that?” she inquired, leaning out of the carriage window.\n“Why, didn’t you know, Miss?” replied the maid. “The wounded prince: he\r\n      spent the night in our house and is going with us.”\n“But who is it? What’s his name?”\n“It’s our intended that was—Prince Bolkónski himself! They say he is\r\n      dying,” replied the maid with a sigh.\nSónya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess, tired\r\n      out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was pacing up\r\n      and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to assemble for the\r\n      usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting. Natásha was not in\r\n      the room.\n“Mamma,” said Sónya, “Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is going\r\n      with us.”\nThe countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sónya’s arm, glanced\r\n      around.\n“Natásha?” she murmured.\nAt that moment this news had only one significance for both of them. They\r\n      knew their Natásha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this\r\n      news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.\n“Natásha does not know yet, but he is going with us,” said Sónya.\n“You say he is dying?”\nSónya nodded.\nThe countess put her arms around Sónya and began to cry.\n“The ways of God are past finding out!” she thought, feeling that the\r\n      Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was now\r\n      taking place.\n“Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What’s the matter?” asked Natásha, as\r\n      with animated face she ran into the room.\n“Nothing,” answered the countess. “If everything is ready let us start.”\nAnd the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. Sónya\r\n      embraced Natásha and kissed her.\nNatásha looked at her inquiringly.\n“What is it? What has happened?”\n“Nothing... No...”\n“Is it something very bad for me? What is it?” persisted Natásha with her\r\n      quick intuition.\nSónya sighed and made no reply. The count, Pétya, Madame Schoss, Mávra\r\n      Kuzmínichna, and Vasílich came into the drawing room and, having closed\r\n      the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated\r\n      without looking at one another.\nThe count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself\r\n      before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced\r\n      Mávra Kuzmínichna and Vasílich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while\r\n      they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs\r\n      lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The countess\r\n      went into the oratory and there Sónya found her on her knees before the\r\n      icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall. (The most\r\n      precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected, were being\r\n      taken with them.)\nIn the porch and in the yard the men whom Pétya had armed with swords and\r\n      daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and\r\n      girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.\nAs is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in\r\n      the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on each\r\n      side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess\r\n      in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the\r\n      carriages, thecalèche, the phaeton, and back again.\n“They always will forget everything!” said the countess. “Don’t you know I\r\n      can’t sit like that?”\nAnd Dunyásha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an aggrieved\r\n      look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat.\n“Oh, those servants!” said the count, swaying his head.\nEfím, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to drive\r\n      her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at\r\n      what was going on behind him. From thirty years’ experience he knew it\r\n      would be some time yet before the order, “Be off, in God’s name!” would be\r\n      given him: and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once\r\n      or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been\r\n      forgotten, and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess\r\n      herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to\r\n      drive carefully down the hill. He knew all this and therefore waited\r\n      calmly for what would happen, with more patience than the horses,\r\n      especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground\r\n      and champing his bit. At last all were seated, the carriage steps were\r\n      folded and pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a traveling\r\n      case, and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say. Then Efím\r\n      deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself. The postilion and\r\n      all the other servants did the same. “Off, in God’s name!” said Efím,\r\n      putting on his hat. “Start!” The postilion started the horses, the off\r\n      pole horse tugged at his collar, the high springs creaked, and the body of\r\n      the coach swayed. The footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach\r\n      which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the\r\n      other vehicles jolted in their turn, and the procession of carriages moved\r\n      up the street. In the carriages, thecalèche, and the phaeton, all crossed\r\n      themselves as they passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to\r\n      remain in Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the\r\n      travelers off.\nRarely had Natásha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in the\r\n      carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of\r\n      forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the carriage\r\n      window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in\r\n      front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see the raised\r\n      hood of Prince Andrew’scalèche. She did not know who was in it,\r\n      but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought thatcalèche.\r\n      She knew it was right in front.\nIn Kúdrino, from the Nikítski, Présnya, and Podnovínsk Streets came\r\n      several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostóvs’, and as they\r\n      passed along the Sadóvaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows\r\n      abreast.\nAs they were going round the Súkharev water tower Natásha, who was\r\n      inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past,\r\n      suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:\n“Dear me! Mamma, Sónya, look, it’s he!”\n“Who? Who?”\n“Look! Yes, on my word, it’s Bezúkhov!” said Natásha, putting her head out\r\n      of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman’s long\r\n      coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman\r\n      in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the Súkharev tower\r\n      accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man in a frieze coat.\n“Yes, it really is Bezúkhov in a coachman’s coat, with a queer-looking old\r\n      boy. Really,” said Natásha, “look, look!”\n“No, it’s not he. How can you talk such nonsense?”\n“Mamma,” screamed Natásha, “I’ll stake my head it’s he! I assure you!\r\n      Stop, stop!” she cried to the coachman.\nBut the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchánski Street came more\r\n      carts and carriages, and the Rostóvs were being shouted at to move on and\r\n      not block the way.\nIn fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rostóvs all\r\n      saw Pierre—or someone extraordinarily like him—in a coachman’s\r\n      coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a\r\n      small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a\r\n      face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully\r\n      touching Pierre’s elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage.\r\n      Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first understand him.\r\n      At length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man\r\n      indicated, he recognized Natásha, and following his first impulse stepped\r\n      instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he\r\n      seemed to remember something and stopped.\nNatásha’s face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical\r\n      kindliness.\n“Peter Kirílovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is wonderful!”\r\n       she cried, holding out her hand to him. “What are you doing? Why are you\r\n      like this?”\nPierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked\r\n      along beside her while the coach still moved on.\n“What is the matter, Count?” asked the countess in a surprised and\r\n      commiserating tone.\n“What? What? Why? Don’t ask me,” said Pierre, and looked round at Natásha\r\n      whose radiant, happy expression—of which he was conscious without\r\n      looking at her—filled him with enchantment.\n“Are you remaining in Moscow, then?”\nPierre hesitated.\n“In Moscow?” he said in a questioning tone. “Yes, in Moscow. Good-by!”\n“Ah, if only I were a man! I’d certainly stay with you. How splendid!”\r\n       said Natásha. “Mamma, if you’ll let me, I’ll stay!”\nPierre glanced absently at Natásha and was about to say something, but the\r\n      countess interrupted him.\n“You were at the battle, we heard.”\n“Yes, I was,” Pierre answered. “There will be another battle tomorrow...”\r\n       he began, but Natásha interrupted him.\n“But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself....”\n“Oh, don’t ask me, don’t ask me! I don’t know myself. Tomorrow... But no!\r\n      Good-by, good-by!” he muttered. “It’s an awful time!” and dropping behind\r\n      the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.\nNatásha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at\r\n      him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile."

    "text": "For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living in\r\n      the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazdéev. This is how it\r\n      happened.\nWhen he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his\r\n      interview with Count Rostopchín, he could not for some time make out where\r\n      he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that among\r\n      others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman who had\r\n      brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Hélène, he felt suddenly\r\n      overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt\r\n      to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all was in\r\n      confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or wrong, the\r\n      future held nothing, and there was no escape from this position. Smiling\r\n      unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat down on the sofa in an\r\n      attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door of the reception room and\r\n      peeped through the crack, returned flourishing his arms, and took up a\r\n      book. His major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who\r\n      had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if\r\n      only for a minute, and that someone from Bazdéev’s widow had called to ask\r\n      Pierre to take charge of her husband’s books, as she herself was leaving\r\n      for the country.\n“Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will\r\n      come directly,” Pierre replied to the major-domo.\nBut as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which was\r\n      lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door. There was\r\n      no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this passage to\r\n      the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands, went\r\n      down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was standing at the\r\n      front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there was a second\r\n      staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that staircase and\r\n      out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were some carriages\r\n      waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and\r\n      the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him. When he felt he\r\n      was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a\r\n      bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head and quickening his pace\r\n      went down the street.\nOf all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph\r\n      Bazdéev’s books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.\nHe hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the Patriarch’s\r\n      Ponds, where the widow Bazdéev’s house was.\nContinually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were\r\n      making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky\r\n      body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre,\r\n      experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to\r\n      talk to his driver.\nThe man told him that arms were being distributed today at the Krémlin and\r\n      that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills gates and\r\n      a great battle would be fought there.\nHaving reached the Patriarch’s Ponds Pierre found the Bazdéevs’ house,\r\n      where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate.\r\n      Gerásim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzhók five\r\n      years before with Joseph Bazdéev, came out in answer to his knock.\n“At home?” asked Pierre.\n“Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danílovna has gone to the\r\n      Torzhók estate with the children, your excellency.”\n“I will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,” said\r\n      Pierre.\n“Be so good as to step in. Makár Alexéevich, the brother of my late master—may\r\n      the kingdom of heaven be his—has remained here, but he is in a weak\r\n      state as you know,” said the old servant.\nPierre knew that Makár Alexéevich was Joseph Bazdéev’s half-insane brother\r\n      and a hard drinker.\n“Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in...” said Pierre and entered the house.\nA tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and\r\n      with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing Pierre he\r\n      muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.\n“He was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your honor\r\n      sees,” said Gerásim. “Will you step into the study?” Pierre nodded. “As it\r\n      was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia Danílovna gave orders that if\r\n      anyone should come from you they were to have the books.”\nPierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such\r\n      trepidation in his benefactor’s lifetime. The room, dusty and untouched\r\n      since the death of Joseph Bazdéev was now even gloomier.\nGerásim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre\r\n      went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts\r\n      were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important, the\r\n      holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts with\r\n      Bazdéev’s notes and explanations. He sat down at the dusty writing table,\r\n      and, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out, closed them,\r\n      finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand sank into\r\n      meditation.\nGerásim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre\r\n      always sitting in the same attitude.\nMore than two hours passed and Gerásim took the liberty of making a slight\r\n      noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not hear him.\n“Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?”\n“Oh yes!” said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. “Look here,”\r\n       he added, taking Gerásim by a button of his coat and looking down at the\r\n      old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, “I say, do you know that\r\n      there is going to be a battle tomorrow?”\n“We heard so,” replied the man.\n“I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.”\n“Yes, your excellency,” replied Gerásim. “Will you have something to eat?”\n“No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a pistol,” said\r\n      Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.\n“Yes, your excellency,” said Gerásim after thinking for a moment.\nAll the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor’s study, and\r\n      Gerásim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and talking\r\n      to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made up for him there.\nGerásim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things,\r\n      accepted Pierre’s taking up his residence in the house without surprise,\r\n      and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same evening—without\r\n      even asking himself what they were wanted for—he procured a\r\n      coachman’s coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him the pistol\r\n      next day. Makár Alexéevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his\r\n      galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at\r\n      Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing\r\n      gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. It was\r\n      when Pierre (wearing the coachman’s coat which Gerásim had procured for\r\n      him and had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy\r\n      the pistol at the Súkharev market that he met the Rostóvs."

    "text": "Kutúzov’s order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryazán road was issued at\r\n      night on the first of September.\nThe first troops started at once, and during the night they marched slowly\r\n      and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing the town\r\n      at the Dorogomílov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding\r\n      and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side and\r\n      blocking the streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were\r\n      bearing down on them from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm\r\n      overcame them. They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and to the\r\n      fords and the boats. Kutúzov himself had driven round by side streets to\r\n      the other side of Moscow.\nBy ten o’clock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear\r\n      guard remained in the Dorogomílov suburb, where they had ample room. The\r\n      main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.\nAt that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,\r\n      Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklónny Hill looking at the\r\n      panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August to the\r\n      second of September, that is from the battle of Borodinó to the entry of\r\n      the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating, memorable\r\n      week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as\r\n      a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring,\r\n      when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the\r\n      eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the\r\n      aromatic autumn air, when even the nights are warm, and when in those dark\r\n      warm nights, golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling\r\n      from the sky.\nAt ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still held.\nThe brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the Poklónny\r\n      Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her\r\n      churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas\r\n      glittering like stars in the sunlight.\nThe view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as he\r\n      had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy\r\n      curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no\r\n      knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full force of\r\n      its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance,\r\n      distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Poklónny Hill\r\n      perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the\r\n      breathing of that great and beautiful body.\nEvery Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every foreigner\r\n      who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city,\r\n      must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.\n“Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables églises, Moscou la sainte. La\r\n      voilà donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il était temps,”* said he, and\r\n      dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and\r\n      summoned Lelorgne d’Ideville, the interpreter.\n* “That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy\r\n     Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was\r\n     high time.”\n“A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,”\r\n       thought he (he had said so to Túchkov at Smolénsk). From that point of\r\n      view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed\r\n      strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable, had\r\n      at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at the city\r\n      and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance of\r\n      possessing it agitated and awed him.\n“But could it be otherwise?” he thought. “Here is this capital at my feet.\r\n      Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange, beautiful,\r\n      and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what light must I\r\n      appear to them!” thought he, thinking of his troops. “Here she is, the\r\n      reward for all those fainthearted men,” he reflected, glancing at those\r\n      near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming up. “One word\r\n      from me, one movement of my hand, and that ancient capital of the Tsars\r\n      would perish. But my clemency is always ready to descend upon the\r\n      vanquished. I must be magnanimous and truly great. But no, it can’t be\r\n      true that I am in Moscow,” he suddenly thought. “Yet here she is lying at\r\n      my feet, with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in\r\n      the sunshine. But I shall spare her. On the ancient monuments of barbarism\r\n      and despotism I will inscribe great words of justice and mercy.... It is\r\n      just this which Alexander will feel most painfully, I know him.” (It\r\n      seemed to Napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in\r\n      the personal struggle between himself and Alexander.) “From the height of\r\n      the Krémlin—yes, there is the Krémlin, yes—I will give them\r\n      just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true civilization, I will make\r\n      generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love. I will tell the\r\n      deputation that I did not, and do not, desire war, that I have waged war\r\n      only against the false policy of their court; that I love and respect\r\n      Alexander and that in Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself\r\n      and of my people. I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to\r\n      humiliate an honored monarch. ‘Boyars,’ I will say to them, ‘I do not\r\n      desire war, I desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects.’ However, I\r\n      know their presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always\r\n      do: clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am\r\n      in Moscow? Yes, there she lies.”\n“Qu’on m’amène les boyars,”* said he to his suite.\n* “Bring the boyars to me.”\nA general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars.\nTwo hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same\r\n      place on the Poklónny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to the\r\n      boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That speech\r\n      was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.\nHe was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to\r\n      adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies\r\n      at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would\r\n      mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the hearts of\r\n      the people. Having learned that there were many charitable institutions in\r\n      Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all. He\r\n      thought that, as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a\r\n      mosque, so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars. And in order\r\n      finally to touch the hearts of the Russians—and being like all\r\n      Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference toma\r\n      chère, ma tendre, ma pauvre mère* —he decided that he would place\r\n      an inscription on all these establishments in large letters: “This\r\n      establishment is dedicated to my dear mother.” Or no, it should be simply:Maison de ma Mère, *(2) he concluded. “But am I really in Moscow? Yes,\r\n      here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the city so long in\r\n      appearing?” he wondered.\n* “My dear, my tender, my poor mother.”\n* (2) “House of my Mother.”\nMeanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among\r\n      his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite. Those sent to fetch\r\n      the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty, that\r\n      everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring together\r\n      were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact that Moscow had\r\n      been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact seemed), but by the\r\n      question how to tell the Emperor—without putting him in the terrible\r\n      position of appearing ridiculous—that he had been awaiting the\r\n      boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left in Moscow but no\r\n      one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped\r\n      together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that the Emperor\r\n      should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then told the\r\n      truth.\n“He will have to be told, all the same,” said some gentlemen of the suite.\r\n      “But, gentlemen...”\nThe position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon his\r\n      magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread\r\n      map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under his lifted\r\n      hand with a bright and proud smile.\n“But it’s impossible...” declared the gentlemen of the\r\n      suite, shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied\r\n      word—le ridicule....\nAt last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor’s instinct\r\n      suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out\r\n      was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with his hand. A single\r\n      report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already\r\n      spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into the city through the Tver,\r\n      Kalúga, and Dorogomílov gates. Faster and faster, vying with one another,\r\n      they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the clouds of dust\r\n      they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling\r\n      shouts.\nDrawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as\r\n      the Dorogomílov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his\r\n      horse, paced for a long time by the Kámmer-Kollézski rampart, awaiting the\r\n      deputation."

    "text": "Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a\r\n      fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty. It\r\n      was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.\nIn a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it\r\n      seems as much alive as other hives.\nThe bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun\r\n      as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of honey\r\n      like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But one has only\r\n      to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it.\r\n      The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the sound that meet the\r\n      beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeper’s tap on the wall of the sick\r\n      hive, instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands\r\n      of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed, and producing by the\r\n      rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound, the only reply is a\r\n      disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive. From the\r\n      alighting board, instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey\r\n      and venom, and the warm whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness\r\n      and decay mingling with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels\r\n      sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense\r\n      of the hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing\r\n      activity, like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds\r\n      of disorder. In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with\r\n      honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do not sting, but crawl away from\r\n      danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they\r\n      flew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower part\r\n      of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy bees—tamed by\r\n      toil, clinging to one another’s legs and drawing out the wax, with a\r\n      ceaseless hum of labor—that used to hang in long clusters down to\r\n      the floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in\r\n      various directions on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a neatly\r\n      glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings, there is a\r\n      floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees scarcely moving\r\n      their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared away.\nThe beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super.\r\n      Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and\r\n      keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the\r\n      combs, but no longer in their former state of purity. All is neglected and\r\n      foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the\r\n      combs, and the short home bees, shriveled and listless as if they were\r\n      old, creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers, having lost\r\n      all motive and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps, and\r\n      butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight.\r\n      Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry\r\n      buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of bees, by force\r\n      of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with efforts beyond\r\n      their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without\r\n      knowing why they do it. In another corner two old bees are languidly\r\n      fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another, without\r\n      themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent. In\r\n      a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack some victim\r\n      and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or killed, drops from\r\n      above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap of corpses. The\r\n      keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells. In\r\n      place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting\r\n      back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation, he sees hundreds\r\n      of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. They have almost all died\r\n      unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no\r\n      more. They reek of decay and death. Only a few of them still move, rise,\r\n      and feebly fly to settle on the enemy’s hand, lacking the spirit to die\r\n      stinging him; the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales. The\r\n      beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark on it, and when he has time tears\r\n      out its contents and burns it clean.\nSo in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and\r\n      morose, paced up and down in front of the Kámmer-Kollézski rampart,\r\n      awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of\r\n      the proprieties—a deputation.\nIn various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly\r\n      moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they\r\n      were doing.\nWhen with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was empty,\r\n      he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently continued to\r\n      walk to and fro.\n“My carriage!” he said.\nHe took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the\r\n      suburb. “Moscow deserted!” he said to himself. “What an incredible event!”\nHe did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dorogomílov\r\n      suburb.\nThecoup de théâtrehad not come off."

    "text": "The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o’clock at night\r\n      till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the last\r\n      of the inhabitants who were leaving.\nThe greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the\r\n      Stone, Moskvá, and Yaúza bridges.\nWhile the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the Krémlin,\r\n      were thronging the Moskvá and the Stone bridges, a great many soldiers,\r\n      taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back from the\r\n      bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of Vasíli the\r\n      Beatified and under the Borovítski gate, back up the hill to the Red\r\n      Square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not\r\n      belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the\r\n      passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were no dealers with voices\r\n      of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter; there were no\r\n      hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasers—but only\r\n      soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets, entering the\r\n      Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way out through its passages\r\n      with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants (of whom there were but few)\r\n      moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered. They unlocked their shops\r\n      and locked them up again, and themselves carried goods away with the help\r\n      of their assistants. On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers\r\n      beating the muster call. But the roll of the drums did not make the\r\n      looting soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly, but made\r\n      them, on the contrary, run farther away. Among the soldiers in the shops\r\n      and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven\r\n      heads. Two officers, one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a\r\n      lean, dark-gray horse, the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the\r\n      corner of Ilyínka Street, talking. A third officer galloped up to them.\n“The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail. This\r\n      is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.”\n“Where are you off to?... Where?...” he shouted to three infantrymen\r\n      without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were\r\n      slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. “Stop, you rascals!”\n“But how are you going to stop them?” replied another officer. “There is\r\n      no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt,\r\n      that’s all!”\n“How can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge, and\r\n      don’t move. Shouldn’t we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from\r\n      running away?”\n“Come, go in there and drive them out!” shouted the senior officer.\nThe officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with\r\n      him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A\r\n      shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm,\r\n      persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and\r\n      ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.\n“Your honor!” said he. “Be so good as to protect us! We won’t grudge\r\n      trifles, you are welcome to anything—we shall be delighted! Pray!...\r\n      I’ll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman, or\r\n      even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is; but what’s all this—sheer\r\n      robbery! If you please, could not guards be placed if only to let us close\r\n      the shop....”\nSeveral shopkeepers crowded round the officer.\n“Eh, what twaddle!” said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man. “When\r\n      one’s head is gone one doesn’t weep for one’s hair! Take what any of you\r\n      like!” And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the\r\n      officer.\n“It’s all very well for you, Iván Sidórych, to talk,” said the first\r\n      tradesman angrily. “Please step inside, your honor!”\n“Talk indeed!” cried the thin one. “In my three shops here I have a\r\n      hundred thousand rubles’ worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army\r\n      has gone? Eh, what people! ‘Against God’s might our hands can’t fight.’”\n“Come inside, your honor!” repeated the tradesman, bowing.\nThe officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.\n“It’s not my business!” he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of\r\n      the passages.\nFrom one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just as\r\n      the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was\r\n      flung out violently.\nThis man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. The\r\n      officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that moment\r\n      fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskvá bridge and\r\n      the officer ran out into the square.\n“What is it? What is it?” he asked, but his comrade was already galloping\r\n      off past Vasíli the Beatified in the direction from which the screams\r\n      came.\nThe officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the\r\n      bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge,\r\n      several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the\r\n      troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were\r\n      harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.\r\n      The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a child’s chair with\r\n      its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate\r\n      shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd\r\n      and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that General Ermólov,\r\n      coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among\r\n      the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge, had ordered two\r\n      guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the bridge. The crowd,\r\n      crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting and squeezing\r\n      desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving\r\n      forward."

    "text": "Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the\r\n      streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round\r\n      the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody drove\r\n      through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The Povarskáya was\r\n      quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard of the Rostóvs’ house was\r\n      littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the horses, and not a soul\r\n      was to be seen there. In the great drawing room of the house, which had\r\n      been left with all it contained, were two people. They were the yard\r\n      porter Ignát, and the page boy Míshka, Vasílich’s grandson who had stayed\r\n      in Moscow with his grandfather. Míshka had opened the clavichord and was\r\n      strumming on it with one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood\r\n      smiling with satisfaction before the large mirror.\n“Isn’t it fine, eh, Uncle Ignát?” said the boy, suddenly beginning to\r\n      strike the keyboard with both hands.\n“Only fancy!” answered Ignát, surprised at the broadening grin on his face\r\n      in the mirror.\n“Impudence! Impudence!” they heard behind them the voice of Mávra\r\n      Kuzmínichna who had entered silently. “How he’s grinning, the fat mug! Is\r\n      that what you’re here for? Nothing’s cleared away down there and Vasílich\r\n      is worn out. Just you wait a bit!”\nIgnát left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the room with\r\n      meekly downcast eyes.\n“Aunt, I did it gently,” said the boy.\n“I’ll give you something gently, you monkey you!” cried Mávra Kuzmínichna,\r\n      raising her arm threateningly. “Go and get the samovar to boil for your\r\n      grandfather.”\nMávra Kuzmínichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and\r\n      with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.\nGoing out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go next—to\r\n      drink tea in the servants’ wing with Vasílich, or into the storeroom to\r\n      put away what still lay about.\nShe heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone\r\n      stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.\r\n      Mávra Kuzmínichna went to the gate.\n“Who do you want?”\n“The count—Count Ilyá Andréevich Rostóv.”\n“And who are you?”\n“An officer, I have to see him,” came the reply in a pleasant, well-bred\r\n      Russian voice.\nMávra Kuzmínichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with the\r\n      round face of a Rostóv, entered the yard.\n“They have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,” said Mávra\r\n      Kuzmínichna cordially.\nThe young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to\r\n      enter or not, clicked his tongue.\n“Ah, how annoying!” he muttered. “I should have come yesterday.... Ah,\r\n      what a pity.”\nMeanwhile, Mávra Kuzmínichna was attentively and sympathetically examining\r\n      the familiar Rostóv features of the young man’s face, his tattered coat\r\n      and trodden-down boots.\n“What did you want to see the count for?” she asked.\n“Oh well... it can’t be helped!” said he in a tone of vexation and placed\r\n      his hand on the gate as if to leave.\nHe again paused in indecision.\n“You see,” he suddenly said, “I am a kinsman of the count’s and he has\r\n      been very kind to me. As you see” (he glanced with an amused air and\r\n      good-natured smile at his coat and boots) “my things are worn out and I\r\n      have no money, so I was going to ask the count...”\nMávra Kuzmínichna did not let him finish.\n“Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment,” said she.\nAnd as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,\r\n      hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the servants’\r\n      quarters.\nWhile Mávra Kuzmínichna was running to her room the officer walked about\r\n      the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint smile\r\n      on his lips. “What a pity I’ve missed Uncle! What a nice old woman! Where\r\n      has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way to overtake my\r\n      regiment, which must by now be getting near the Rogózhski gate?” thought\r\n      he. Just then Mávra Kuzmínichna appeared from behind the corner of the\r\n      house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a rolled-up check\r\n      kerchief in her hand. While still a few steps from the officer she\r\n      unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twenty-five-ruble\r\n      assignat and hastily handed it to him.\n“If his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of course...\r\n      but as it is...”\nMávra Kuzmínichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not decline,\r\n      but took the note quietly and thanked her.\n“If the count had been at home...” Mávra Kuzmínichna went on\r\n      apologetically. “Christ be with you, sir! May God preserve you!” said she,\r\n      bowing as she saw him out.\nSwaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran\r\n      almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yaúza bridge to\r\n      overtake his regiment.\nBut Mávra Kuzmínichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist\r\n      eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of\r\n      motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer."

    "text": "From an unfinished house on the Varvárka, the ground floor of which was a\r\n      dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches round the tables in a\r\n      dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring, with\r\n      dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously singing some song\r\n      or other. They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with great\r\n      effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because they wanted\r\n      to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a\r\n      clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine\r\n      straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin,\r\n      compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently\r\n      possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing, and solemnly\r\n      and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve\r\n      turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty\r\n      fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully\r\n      rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were most important that\r\n      the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare. In the midst of\r\n      the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows in the passage and\r\n      porch. The tall lad waved his arm.\n“Stop it!” he exclaimed peremptorily. “There’s a fight, lads!” And, still\r\n      rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.\nThe factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership of the\r\n      tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had brought the\r\n      publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served\r\n      them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, hearing the sounds of\r\n      revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into, wished to\r\n      force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted.\nThe publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when the\r\n      workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern keeper,\r\n      fell face downward on the pavement.\nAnother smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican\r\n      with his chest.\nThe lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and\r\n      cried wildly: “They’re fighting us, lads!”\nAt that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised face to\r\n      make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: “Police! Murder!... They’ve\r\n      killed a man, lads!”\n“Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death—killed!...” screamed a woman\r\n      coming out of a gate close by.\nA crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.\n“Haven’t you robbed people enough—taking their last shirts?” said a\r\n      voice addressing the publican. “What have you killed a man for, you\r\n      thief?”\nThe tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from the\r\n      publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to\r\n      fight now.\n“Murderer!” he shouted suddenly to the publican. “Bind him, lads!”\n“I daresay you would like to bind me!” shouted the publican, pushing away\r\n      the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head he flung it\r\n      on the ground.\nAs if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the\r\n      workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.\n“I know the law very well, mates! I’ll take the matter to the captain of\r\n      police. You think I won’t get to him? Robbery is not permitted to anybody\r\n      nowadays!” shouted the publican, picking up his cap.\n“Come along then! Come along then!” the publican and the tall young fellow\r\n      repeated one after the other, and they moved up the street together.\nThe bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and others\r\n      followed behind, talking and shouting.\nAt the corner of the Moroséyka, opposite a large house with closed\r\n      shutters and bearing a bootmaker’s signboard, stood a score of thin,\r\n      worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered\r\n      coats.\n“He should pay folks off properly,” a thin workingman, with frowning brows\r\n      and a straggly beard, was saying.\n“But he’s sucked our blood and now he thinks he’s quit of us. He’s been\r\n      misleading us all the week and now that he’s brought us to this pass he’s\r\n      made off.”\nOn seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking,\r\n      and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving crowd.\n“Where are all the folks going?”\n“Why, to the police, of course!”\n“I say, is it true that we have been beaten?” “And what did you think?\r\n      Look what folks are saying.”\nQuestions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage of the\r\n      increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.\nThe tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his bare\r\n      arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention to\r\n      himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting\r\n      answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.\n“He must keep order, keep the law, that’s what the government is there\r\n      for. Am I not right, good Christians?” said the tall youth, with a\r\n      scarcely perceptible smile. “He thinks there’s no government! How can one\r\n      do without government? Or else there would be plenty who’d rob us.”\n“Why talk nonsense?” rejoined voices in the crowd. “Will they give up\r\n      Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it! Aren’t\r\n      there plenty of troops on the march? Lethimin, indeed! That’s what the\r\n      government is for. You’d better listen to what people are saying,” said\r\n      some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.\nBy the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered round a\r\n      man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.\n“An ukáse, they are reading an ukáse! Reading an ukáse!” cried voices in\r\n      the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.\nThe man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31. When\r\n      the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand of the\r\n      tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather tremulous\r\n      voice to read the sheet from the beginning.\n“Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,” he read (“Sirin\r\n      Highness,”said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and a\r\n      frown on his brow), “to consult with him to act, and to aid the army to\r\n      exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part...” the reader went\r\n      on, and then paused (“Do you see,” shouted the youth victoriously, “he’s\r\n      going to clear up the whole affair for you....”), “in destroying them, and\r\n      will send these visitors to the devil. I will come back to dinner, and\r\n      we’ll set to work. We will do, completely do, and undo these scoundrels.”\nThe last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The tall\r\n      lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood the\r\n      last part. In particular, the words “I will come back to dinner,”\r\n       evidently displeased both reader and audience. The people’s minds were\r\n      tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly\r\n      comprehensible—it was what any one of them might have said and\r\n      therefore was what an ukáse emanating from the highest authority should\r\n      not say.\nThey all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his lips and\r\n      swayed from side to side.\n“We should ask him... that’s he himself?”... “Yes, ask him indeed!... Why\r\n      not? He’ll explain”... voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly heard\r\n      saying, and the general attention turned to the police superintendent’s\r\n      trap which drove into the square attended by two mounted dragoons.\nThe superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count\r\n      Rostopchín’s orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that\r\n      matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his\r\n      pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to stop.\n“What people are these?” he shouted to the men, who were moving singly and\r\n      timidly in the direction of his trap.\n“What people are these?” he shouted again, receiving no answer.\n“Your honor...” replied the shopman in the frieze coat, “your honor, in\r\n      accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they\r\n      desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of riot,\r\n      but as his highest excellence said...”\n“The count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued\r\n      concerning you,” said the superintendent of police. “Go on!” he ordered\r\n      his coachman.\nThe crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the\r\n      superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.\nThe superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared\r\n      look, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their\r\n      speed.\n“It’s a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!” shouted the tall\r\n      youth. “Don’t let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!” shouted\r\n      different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.\nFollowing the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went\r\n      in the direction of the Lubyánka Street.\n“There now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to perish.\r\n      Do they think we’re dogs?” voices in the crowd were heard saying more and\r\n      more frequently."

    "text": "On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with\r\n      Kutúzov, Count Rostopchín had returned to Moscow mortified and offended\r\n      because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and because\r\n      Kutúzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of\r\n      the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp,\r\n      which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as\r\n      not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters.\r\n      Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this, Rostopchín had returned\r\n      to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was\r\n      awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from\r\n      Kutúzov. This letter requested the count to send police officers to guide\r\n      the troops through the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryazán road\r\n      beyond Moscow. This was not news to Rostopchín. He had known that Moscow\r\n      would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with\r\n      Kutúzov on the Poklónny Hill but ever since the battle of Borodinó, for\r\n      all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle had said unanimously\r\n      that it was impossible to fight another battle, and since then the\r\n      government property had been removed every night, and half the inhabitants\r\n      had left the city with Rostopchín’s own permission. Yet all the same this\r\n      information astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in the\r\n      form of a simple note with an order from Kutúzov, and received at night,\r\n      breaking in on his beauty sleep.\nWhen later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchín explained his actions at\r\n      this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important\r\n      considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the\r\n      departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all\r\n      Rostopchín’s actions appear irreproachable. “Why were the holy relics, the\r\n      arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why were\r\n      thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would not be\r\n      given up—and thereby ruined?” “To preserve the tranquillity of the\r\n      city,” explains Count Rostopchín. “Why were bundles of useless papers from\r\n      the government offices, and Leppich’s balloon and other articles removed?”\r\n       “To leave the town empty,” explains Count Rostopchín. One need only admit\r\n      that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a\r\n      justification.\nAll the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for\r\n      public tranquillity.\nOn what, then, was Count Rostopchín’s fear for the tranquillity of Moscow\r\n      based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability of an\r\n      uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating\r\n      troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to riot?\nNeither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an\r\n      insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than ten\r\n      thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of September,\r\n      and except for a mob in the governor’s courtyard, assembled there at his\r\n      bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would have been even\r\n      less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle\r\n      of Borodinó, when the surrender of Moscow became certain or at least\r\n      probable, Rostopchín instead of exciting the people by distributing arms\r\n      and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics, the\r\n      gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the population plainly that\r\n      the town would be abandoned.\nRostopchín, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and\r\n      impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles\r\n      and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be\r\n      guiding. Ever since the enemy’s entry into Smolénsk he had in imagination\r\n      been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of “the heart of\r\n      Russia.” Not only did it seem to him (as to all administrators) that he\r\n      controlled the external actions of Moscow’s inhabitants, but he also\r\n      thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets\r\n      and posters, written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their\r\n      own class and do not understand from those in authority. Rostopchín was so\r\n      pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so\r\n      used to it, that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning\r\n      Moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt\r\n      the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did not\r\n      know what to do. Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the last\r\n      moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not\r\n      prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government\r\n      offices were removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to\r\n      whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had\r\n      created for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent\r\n      imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he\r\n      knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and\r\n      did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.\nAll his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful and\r\n      had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply directed\r\n      toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the\r\n      French.\nBut when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing\r\n      hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not even\r\n      possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when self-confidence\r\n      was of no avail in relation to the one question before Moscow, when the\r\n      whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man, abandoning their\r\n      belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their\r\n      national feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopchín suddenly appeared\r\n      senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous, weak, and alone, with\r\n      no ground to stand on.\nWhen, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note from\r\n      Kutúzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to blame. All\r\n      that he had been specially put in charge of, the state property which he\r\n      should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no longer possible to\r\n      take the whole of it away.\n“Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?” he\r\n      ruminated. “Not I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow firmly\r\n      in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains! Traitors!”\r\n       he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and traitors were,\r\n      but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever they might be who\r\n      were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found\r\n      himself.\nAll that night Count Rostopchín issued orders, for which people came to\r\n      him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the count so\r\n      morose and irritable.\n“Your excellency, the Director of the Registrar’s Department has sent\r\n      for instructions.... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the University,\r\n      from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent... asking for\r\n      information.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade? From the\r\n      governor of the prison... from the superintendent of the lunatic\r\n      asylum...” All night long such announcements were continually being\r\n      received by the count.\nTo all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that\r\n      orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully\r\n      prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody\r\n      would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.\n“Oh, tell that blockhead,” he said in reply to the question from the\r\n      Registrar’s Department, “that he should remain to guard his documents.\r\n      Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have\r\n      horses, let them be off to Vladímir, and not leave them to the French.”\n“Your excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come: what\r\n      are your commands?”\n“My commands? Let them go away, that’s all.... And let the lunatics out\r\n      into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means these\r\n      other madmen to be free.”\nIn reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count Rostopchín\r\n      shouted angrily at the governor:\n“Do you expect me to give you two battalions—which we have not got—for\r\n      a convoy? Release them, that’s all about it!”\n“Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshkóv,\r\n      Vereshchágin...”\n“Vereshchágin! Hasn’t he been hanged yet?” shouted Rostopchín. “Bring him\r\n      to me!”"

    "text": "Toward nine o’clock in the morning, when the troops were already moving\r\n      through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions. Those\r\n      who were able to get away were going of their own accord, those who\r\n      remained behind decided for themselves what they must do.\nThe count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokólniki, and sat\r\n      in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.\nIn quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is\r\n      only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept\r\n      going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every\r\n      administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the\r\n      sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark,\r\n      holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving,\r\n      naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to. But\r\n      as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to\r\n      move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves independently\r\n      with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer reaches the moving\r\n      vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a\r\n      source of power, becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.\nRostopchín felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.\nThe superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to see\r\n      him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the horses\r\n      were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of police,\r\n      after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received,\r\n      informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard\r\n      and wished to see him.\nWithout saying a word Rostopchín rose and walked hastily to his light,\r\n      luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the handle,\r\n      let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a better view of\r\n      the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front, flourishing his arm\r\n      and saying something with a stern look. The blood-stained smith stood\r\n      beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of voices was audible through the\r\n      closed window.\n“Is my carriage ready?” asked Rostopchín, stepping back from the window.\n“It is, your excellency,” replied the adjutant.\nRostopchín went again to the balcony door.\n“But what do they want?” he asked the superintendent of police.\n“Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your orders,\r\n      to go against the French, and they shouted something about treachery. But\r\n      it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency—I hardly managed to get\r\n      away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...”\n“You may go. I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” exclaimed Rostopchín\r\n      angrily.\nHe stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.\n“This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done with\r\n      me!” thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up within him\r\n      against the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed. As\r\n      often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by anger but was\r\n      still seeking an object on which to vent it. “Here is that mob, the dregs\r\n      of the people,” he thought as he gazed at the crowd: “this rabble they\r\n      have roused by their folly! They want a victim,” he thought as he looked\r\n      at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this thought occurred to him just\r\n      because he himself desired a victim, something on which to vent his rage.\n“Is the carriage ready?” he asked again.\n“Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchágin? He is\r\n      waiting at the porch,” said the adjutant.\n“Ah!” exclaimed Rostopchín, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.\nAnd rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony. The\r\n      talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes were\r\n      raised to the count.\n“Good morning, lads!” said the count briskly and loudly. “Thank you for\r\n      coming. I’ll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle with\r\n      the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of Moscow.\r\n      Wait for me!”\nAnd the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door\r\n      behind him.\nA murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. “He’ll\r\n      settle with all the villains, you’ll see! And you said the French... He’ll\r\n      show you what law is!” the mob were saying as if reproving one another for\r\n      their lack of confidence.\nA few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door, gave\r\n      an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved eagerly from\r\n      the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchín, coming out there with quick\r\n      angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.\n“Where is he?” he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man coming\r\n      round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin\r\n      neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by short\r\n      hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined\r\n      with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict trousers,\r\n      over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots. On his thin,\r\n      weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements.\n“Ah!” said Rostopchín, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young man\r\n      in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch. “Put\r\n      him there.”\nThe young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot\r\n      indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his\r\n      neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and\r\n      submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.\nFor several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step\r\n      the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were\r\n      all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling\r\n      of feet be heard.\nWhile waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopchín\r\n      stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.\n“Lads!” said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. “This man,\r\n      Vereshchágin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.”\nThe young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a\r\n      submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young\r\n      face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At the\r\n      count’s first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing\r\n      to say something or at least to meet his eye. But Rostopchín did not look\r\n      at him. A vein in the young man’s long thin neck swelled like a cord and\r\n      went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.\nAll eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more\r\n      hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly and\r\n      timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.\n“He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to Bonaparte.\r\n      He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name, he has caused\r\n      Moscow to perish,” said Rostopchín in a sharp, even voice, but suddenly he\r\n      glanced down at Vereshchágin who continued to stand in the same submissive\r\n      attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his arm and addressed the\r\n      people, almost shouting:\n“Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.”\nThe crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one\r\n      another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling atmosphere,\r\n      to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown, uncomprehended, and\r\n      terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing in front, who had seen\r\n      and heard what had taken place before them, all stood with wide-open eyes\r\n      and mouths, straining with all their strength, and held back the crowd\r\n      that was pushing behind them.\n“Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!”\r\n       shouted Rostopchín. “Cut him down. I command it.”\nHearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchín’s voice, the\r\n      crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.\n“Count!” exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchágin in the\r\n      midst of the momentary silence that ensued, “Count! One God is above us\r\n      both....” He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck\r\n      filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.\nHe did not finish what he wished to say.\n“Cut him down! I command it...” shouted Rostopchín, suddenly growing pale\r\n      like Vereshchágin.\n“Draw sabers!” cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.\nAnother still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the\r\n      front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall\r\n      youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood\r\n      beside Vereshchágin.\n“Saber him!” the dragoon officer almost whispered.\nAnd one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury, struck\r\n      Vereshchágin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.\n“Ah!” cried Vereshchágin in meek surprise, looking round with a frightened\r\n      glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A similar moan of\r\n      surprise and horror ran through the crowd. “O Lord!” exclaimed a sorrowful\r\n      voice.\nBut after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshchágin\r\n      he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier of\r\n      human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in check\r\n      suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The\r\n      plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar\r\n      of the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that\r\n      last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks,\r\n      carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was about\r\n      to repeat his blow. Vereshchágin with a cry of horror, covering his head\r\n      with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he\r\n      stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell\r\n      with him under the feet of the pressing, struggling crowd.\nSome beat and tore at Vereshchágin, others at the tall youth. And the\r\n      screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to\r\n      rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long\r\n      time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten almost\r\n      to death. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with which the\r\n      mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were hitting,\r\n      throttling, and tearing at Vereshchágin were unable to kill him, for the\r\n      crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them in the center\r\n      and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let him go.\n“Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ.... Still\r\n      alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief right. Use\r\n      the hatchet!... What—still alive?”\nOnly when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a\r\n      long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate,\r\n      bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one came up, glanced\r\n      at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and astonishment pushed\r\n      back again.\n“O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?” voices\r\n      in the crowd could be heard saying. “Quite a young fellow too... must have\r\n      been a merchant’s son. What men!... and they say he’s not the right\r\n      one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there’s another has been\r\n      beaten too—they say he’s nearly done for.... Oh, the people...\r\n      Aren’t they afraid of sinning?...” said the same mob now, looking with\r\n      pained distress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck\r\n      and its livid face stained with blood and dust.\nA painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in his\r\n      excellency’s courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away. Two\r\n      dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground.\r\n      The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck trailed\r\n      twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.\nAt the moment when Vereshchágin fell and the crowd closed in with savage\r\n      yells and swayed about him, Rostopchín suddenly turned pale and, instead\r\n      of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went with\r\n      hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the passage\r\n      leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The count’s face was white and\r\n      he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.\n“This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way, please...”\r\n       said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.\nCount Rostopchín was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in the\r\n      direction indicated. At the back entrance stood hiscalèche. The distant\r\n      roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily took his seat\r\n      and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in Sokólniki.\nWhen they reached the Myasnítski Street and could no longer hear the\r\n      shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with\r\n      dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his\r\n      subordinates. “The mob is terrible—disgusting,” he said to himself\r\n      in French. “They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.”\r\n       “Count! One God is above us both!”—Vereshchágin’s words suddenly\r\n      recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this was\r\n      only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchín smiled disdainfully at\r\n      himself. “I had other duties,” thought he. “The people had to be appeased.\r\n      Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public good”—and\r\n      he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city\r\n      entrusted to him, and of himself—not himself as Theodore Vasílyevich\r\n      Rostopchín (he fancied that Theodore Vasílyevich Rostopchín was\r\n      sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor, the\r\n      representative of authority and of the Tsar. “Had I been simply Theodore\r\n      Vasílyevich my course of action would have been quite different, but it\r\n      was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief.”\nLightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer\r\n      hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchín grew physically calm\r\n      and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind\r\n      devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The thought which\r\n      tranquillized Rostopchín was not a new one. Since the world began and men\r\n      have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against his\r\n      fellow man without comforting himself with this same idea. This idea isle\r\n      bien public, the hypothetical welfare of other people.\nTo a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he who\r\n      commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And\r\n      Rostopchín now knew it.\nNot only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but he even\r\n      found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully contrived to\r\n      avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the\r\n      same time pacify the mob.\n“Vereshchágin was tried and condemned to death,” thought Rostopchín\r\n      (though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchágin to hard labor), “he was\r\n      a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have\r\n      killed two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim\r\n      and at the same time punished a miscreant.”\nHaving reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic\r\n      arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.\nHalf an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the\r\n      Sokólniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering\r\n      what was to come. He was driving to the Yaúza bridge where he had heard\r\n      that Kutúzov was. Count Rostopchín was mentally preparing the angry and\r\n      stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutúzov for his deception. He\r\n      would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the\r\n      calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of\r\n      Russia (as Rostopchín regarded it) would fall upon his doting old head.\r\n      Planning beforehand what he would say to Kutúzov, Rostopchín turned\r\n      angrily in hiscalècheand gazed sternly from side to side.\nThe Sokólniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the\r\n      almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white and\r\n      others like them walking singly across the field shouting and\r\n      gesticulating.\nOne of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchín’s carriage,\r\n      and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons looked with vague\r\n      horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one\r\n      running toward them.\nSwaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering\r\n      dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on\r\n      Rostopchín, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him\r\n      to stop. The lunatic’s solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow, with its\r\n      beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with saffron-yellow\r\n      whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.\n“Stop! Pull up, I tell you!” he cried in a piercing voice, and again\r\n      shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.\nComing abreast of thecalèchehe ran beside it.\n“Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead. They stoned\r\n      me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall rise. They have\r\n      torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown... Thrice will I\r\n      overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!” he cried, raising his voice\r\n      higher and higher.\nCount Rostopchín suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed\r\n      in on Vereshchágin. He turned away. “Go fas... faster!” he cried in a\r\n      trembling voice to his coachman. Thecalècheflew over the ground as fast\r\n      as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count Rostopchín still\r\n      heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance, while\r\n      his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened, bloodstained face of\r\n      “the traitor” in the fur-lined coat.\nRecent as that mental picture was, Rostopchín already felt that it had cut\r\n      deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that the\r\n      gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that the\r\n      terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more\r\n      cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear the\r\n      sound of his own words: “Cut him down! I command it....”\n“Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them.... I\r\n      need not have said them,” he thought. “And then nothing would have\r\n      happened.” He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon\r\n      who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the\r\n      fur-lined coat had turned upon him. “But I did not do it for my own sake.\r\n      I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public\r\n      welfare,” thought he.\nTroops were still crowding at the Yaúza bridge. It was hot. Kutúzov,\r\n      dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip\r\n      in the sand when acalèchedashed up noisily. A man in a general’s uniform\r\n      with plumes in his hat went up to Kutúzov and said something in French. It\r\n      was Count Rostopchín. He told Kutúzov that he had come because Moscow, the\r\n      capital, was no more and only the army remained.\n“Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told me\r\n      that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this would\r\n      not have happened,” he said.\nKutúzov looked at Rostopchín as if, not grasping what was said to him, he\r\n      was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face\r\n      of the man addressing him. Rostopchín grew confused and became silent.\r\n      Kutúzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from\r\n      Rostopchín’s face muttered softly:\n“No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!”\nWhether Kutúzov was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke\r\n      those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be meaningless, at\r\n      any rate Rostopchín made no reply and hastily left him. And strange to\r\n      say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count Rostopchín, took up a Cossack\r\n      whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the\r\n      carts that blocked the way."

    "text": "Toward four o’clock in the afternoon Murat’s troops were entering Moscow.\r\n      In front rode a detachment of Württemberg hussars and behind them rode the\r\n      King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.\nAbout the middle of the Arbát Street, near the Church of the Miraculous\r\n      Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced\r\n      detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel,le\r\n      Kremlin.\nAround Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow. They\r\n      all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired commander\r\n      dressed up in feathers and gold.\n“Is that their Tsar himself? He’s not bad!” low voices could be heard\r\n      saying.\nAn interpreter rode up to the group.\n“Take off your cap... your caps!” These words went from one to another in\r\n      the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far\r\n      to the Krémlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar\r\n      Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking Russian,\r\n      did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the\r\n      others.\nMurat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian\r\n      army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several voices\r\n      at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer, returning from\r\n      the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported that the gates of\r\n      the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade\r\n      there.\n“Good!” said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,\r\n      ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.\nThe guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced up\r\n      the Arbát. When they reached the end of the Vozdvízhenka Street they\r\n      halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers superintended the\r\n      placing of the guns and looked at the Krémlin through field glasses.\nThe bells in the Krémlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound troubled\r\n      the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few infantrymen ran\r\n      to the Kutáfyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been put there, and two\r\n      musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an officer and men\r\n      began to run toward it. A general who was standing by the guns shouted\r\n      some words of command to the officer, and the latter ran back again with\r\n      his men.\nThe sound of three more shots came from the gate.\nOne shot struck a French soldier’s foot, and from behind the screens came\r\n      the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a word of\r\n      command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the French\r\n      general, officers, and men changed to one of determined concentrated\r\n      readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from the marshal to the\r\n      least soldier, that place was not the Vozdvízhenka, Mokhaváya, or Kutáfyev\r\n      Street, nor the Tróitsa Gate (places familiar in Moscow), but a new\r\n      battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary. And all made ready for\r\n      that battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The guns were advanced, the\r\n      artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks, and an officer gave the\r\n      word “Fire!” This was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot,\r\n      one after another. The shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon\r\n      the wooden beams and screens, and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over\r\n      the Square.\nA few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the\r\n      stone-built Krémlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above\r\n      their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the\r\n      air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound\r\n      came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the\r\n      figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant’s coat. He grasped a musket and\r\n      took aim at the French. “Fire!” repeated the officer once more, and the\r\n      reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously. The\r\n      gate was again hidden by smoke.\nNothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers\r\n      and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and\r\n      four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall,\r\n      toward the Známenka.\n“Clear that away!” said the officer, pointing to the beams and the\r\n      corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw the\r\n      corpses over the parapet.\nWho these men were nobody knew. “Clear that away!” was all that was said\r\n      of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that\r\n      they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their\r\n      memory: “These wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having supplied\r\n      themselves with guns from the arsenal, and fired” (the wretches) “at the\r\n      French. Some of them were sabered and the Krémlin was purged of their\r\n      presence.”\nMurat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered the\r\n      gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the\r\n      windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square for\r\n      fuel and kindled fires there.\nOther detachments passed through the Krémlin and encamped along the\r\n      Moroséyka, the Lubyánka, and Pokróvka Streets. Others quartered themselves\r\n      along the Vozdvízhenka, the Nikólski, and the Tverskóy Streets. No masters\r\n      of the houses being found anywhere, the French were not billeted on the\r\n      inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp.\nThough tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their\r\n      original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It was\r\n      a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But it\r\n      remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their\r\n      different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began to\r\n      disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost forever\r\n      and there came into being something nondescript, neither citizens nor\r\n      soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks later these same\r\n      men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They were a mob of\r\n      marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him\r\n      valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left Moscow was no longer,\r\n      as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep what he had acquired. Like\r\n      a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug, and having\r\n      seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it\r\n      holds, and therefore perishes, the French when they left Moscow had\r\n      inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them, yet to\r\n      abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the\r\n      monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each\r\n      regiment had entered a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left.\r\n      Men in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the\r\n      windows, laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms\r\n      similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or\r\n      breaking open coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and\r\n      kneading and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or\r\n      frightening, amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many\r\n      such men both in the shops and houses—but there was no army.\nOrder after order was issued by the French commanders that day forbidding\r\n      the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any violence to the\r\n      inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call for that very\r\n      evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had till then\r\n      constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted city with its\r\n      comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well\r\n      together when crossing a barren field, but gets out of hand and at once\r\n      disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the\r\n      army disperse all over the wealthy city.\nNo residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers—like water\r\n      percolating through sand—spread irresistibly through the city in all\r\n      directions from the Krémlin into which they had first marched. The\r\n      cavalry, on entering a merchant’s house that had been abandoned and\r\n      finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on, all\r\n      the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of them\r\n      appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and quarreled\r\n      and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had had time to\r\n      secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and,\r\n      hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed to places where\r\n      valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers followed to check\r\n      the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage\r\n      Row carriages had been left in the shops, and generals flocked there to\r\n      selectcalèchesand coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had\r\n      remained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby to\r\n      secure themselves from being plundered. There were masses of wealth and\r\n      there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the French\r\n      were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where, they thought,\r\n      yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed the army ever\r\n      deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground\r\n      and the water disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of\r\n      the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and\r\n      looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city.\n\nThe French attributed the Fire of Moscowau patriotisme féroce de\r\n      Rostopchíne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,\r\n      however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning of\r\n      Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible for\r\n      it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any\r\n      town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it had, or\r\n      had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted Moscow had\r\n      to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks\r\n      continually fall for several days. A town built of wood, where scarcely a\r\n      day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence\r\n      and a police force is present, cannot help burning when its inhabitants\r\n      have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make\r\n      campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and cook themselves\r\n      meals twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in\r\n      the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district\r\n      immediately increases. How much then must the probability of fire be\r\n      increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops are quartered.“Le patriotisme féroce de Rostopchíne”and the barbarity of the\r\n      French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by the\r\n      soldiers’ pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of enemy\r\n      soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any arson (which is\r\n      very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the houses—in any\r\n      case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson cannot be regarded as\r\n      the cause, for the same thing would have happened without any\r\n      incendiarism.\n* To Rostopchín’s ferocious patriotism.\nHowever tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchín’s ferocity\r\n      and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later on to place an\r\n      heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is impossible not to see\r\n      that there could be no such direct cause of the fire, for Moscow had to\r\n      burn as every village, factory, or house must burn which is left by its\r\n      owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge.\r\n      Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it is true, but by those who had\r\n      abandoned it and not by those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by\r\n      the enemy did not remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other towns,\r\n      simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French\r\n      with bread and salt, nor bring them the keys of the city."

    "text": "The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it did, only\r\n      reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the second\r\n      of September.\nAfter the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances,\r\n      Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely obsessed by\r\n      one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had taken\r\n      such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past, understood\r\n      nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a\r\n      dream.\nHe had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life’s demands\r\n      that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable to\r\n      unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alexéevich’s house, on the plea of sorting\r\n      the deceased’s books and papers, only in search of rest from life’s\r\n      turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph Alexéevich was connected\r\n      with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite contrary to the\r\n      restless confusion into which he felt himself being drawn. He sought a\r\n      quiet refuge, and in Joseph Alexéevich’s study he really found it. When he\r\n      sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness\r\n      of the study, calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one\r\n      after another in his imagination, particularly of the battle of Borodinó\r\n      and of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared\r\n      with the truth, simplicity, and strength of the class of men he mentally\r\n      classed asthey. When Gerásim roused him from his reverie the idea\r\n      occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of Moscow which he\r\n      knew was projected. And with that object he had asked Gerásim to get him a\r\n      peasant’s coat and a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining\r\n      in Joseph Alexéevich’s house and keeping his name secret. Then during the\r\n      first day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix\r\n      his attention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the\r\n      idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of\r\n      his name in connection with Bonaparte’s more than once vaguely presented\r\n      itself. But the idea that he,L’russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit\r\n      to the power of theBeastwas as yet only one of the fancies that often\r\n      passed through his mind and left no trace behind.\nWhen, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among\r\n      the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the Rostóvs and\r\n      Natásha had said to him: “Are you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!”\r\n       the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing,\r\n      even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was\r\n      predestined to do.\nNext day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any\r\n      way behindthem, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he returned\r\n      to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he suddenly felt\r\n      that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had now become\r\n      absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in Moscow, concealing\r\n      his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and either perish or put an\r\n      end to the misery of all Europe—which it seemed to him was solely\r\n      due to Napoleon.\nPierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte’s life in 1809 by\r\n      a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot. And\r\n      the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design\r\n      excited him still more.\nTwo equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose. The\r\n      first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of\r\n      the common calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go to\r\n      Mozháysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick of the\r\n      battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and, in place of\r\n      the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa\r\n      without undressing and eat the same food as Gerásim. The other was that\r\n      vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional,\r\n      artificial, and human—for everything the majority of men regard as\r\n      the greatest good in the world. Pierre had first experienced this strange\r\n      and fascinating feeling at the Slobóda Palace, when he had suddenly felt\r\n      that wealth, power, and life—all that men so painstakingly acquire\r\n      and guard—if it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with\r\n      which it can all be renounced.\nIt was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last\r\n      penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no\r\n      apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he\r\n      possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an\r\n      ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal power\r\n      and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman criterion of\r\n      life.\nFrom the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time\r\n      at the Slobóda Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but\r\n      only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre\r\n      was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he\r\n      had already done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like\r\n      everyone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and his\r\n      announcement to the Rostóvs that he would remain in Moscow would all\r\n      become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to this\r\n      Pierre was very sensitive.\nPierre’s physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his\r\n      mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during\r\n      those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen, two\r\n      almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding—all\r\n      this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.\nIt was two o’clock in the afternoon. The French had already entered\r\n      Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about his\r\n      undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his fancy he\r\n      did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the\r\n      death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy\r\n      enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.\n“Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!” he thought.\r\n      “Yes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger? But\r\n      that is all the same! ‘It is not I but the hand of Providence that\r\n      punishes thee,’ I shall say,” thought he, imagining what he would say when\r\n      killing Napoleon. “Well then, take me and execute me!” he went on,\r\n      speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.\nWhile Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself\r\n      in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the\r\n      figure of Makár Alexéevich, always so timid before but now quite\r\n      transformed.\nHis dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He was\r\n      obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but noticing\r\n      embarrassment on Pierre’s face immediately grew bold and, staggering on\r\n      his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.\n“They’re frightened,” he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. “I say I\r\n      won’t surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?”\nHe paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it with\r\n      unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.\nGerásim and the porter, who had followed Makár Alexéevich, stopped him in\r\n      the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming out\r\n      into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy old\r\n      man. Makár Alexéevich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol and\r\n      screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.\n“To arms! Board them! No, you shan’t get it,” he yelled.\n“That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness—please, sir,\r\n      to let go! Please, sir...” pleaded Gerásim, trying carefully to steer\r\n      Makár Alexéevich by the elbows back to the door.\n“Who are you? Bonaparte!...” shouted Makár Alexéevich.\n“That’s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to\r\n      have the pistol.”\n“Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?” shouted Makár\r\n      Alexéevich, brandishing the pistol. “Board them!”\n“Catch hold!” whispered Gerásim to the porter.\nThey seized Makár Alexéevich by the arms and dragged him to the door.\nThe vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of a\r\n      tipsy, hoarse voice.\nSuddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from the\r\n      porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.\n“It’s them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!” she cried.\nGerásim and the porter let Makár Alexéevich go, and in the now silent\r\n      corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be\r\n      heard."

    "text": "Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would\r\n      disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the\r\n      half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon as\r\n      the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not retire—an\r\n      irresistible curiosity kept him there.\nThere were two of them. One was an officer—a tall, soldierly,\r\n      handsome man—the other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned,\r\n      short, and thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer\r\n      walked in front, leaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had\r\n      advanced a few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were\r\n      good quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and\r\n      in a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done\r\n      that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his\r\n      mustache and lightly touched his hat.\n“Bonjour, la compagnie!”* said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.\n* “Good day, everybody!”\nNo one gave any reply.\n“Vous êtes le bourgeois?”* the officer asked Gerásim.\n* “Are you the master here?”\nGerásim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.\n“Quartier, quartier, logement!”said the officer, looking down at the\r\n      little man with a condescending and good-natured smile.“Les français sont\r\n      de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fâchons pas, mon vieux!”*\r\n      added he, clapping the scared and silent Gerásim on the shoulder. “Well,\r\n      does no one speak French in this establishment?” he asked again in French,\r\n      looking around and meeting Pierre’s eyes. Pierre moved away from the door.\n* “Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good\r\n     fellows. What the devil! There, don’t let us be cross, old\r\n     fellow!”\nAgain the officer turned to Gerásim and asked him to show him the rooms in\r\n      the house.\n“Master, not here—don’t understand... me, you...” said Gerásim,\r\n      trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.\nStill smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before Gerásim’s\r\n      nose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved,\r\n      limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go\r\n      away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makár Alexéevich\r\n      appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With a\r\n      madman’s cunning, Makár Alexéevich eyed the Frenchman, raised his pistol,\r\n      and took aim.\n“Board them!” yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing\r\n      the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw\r\n      himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the\r\n      pistol Makár Alexéevich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there was\r\n      a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The\r\n      Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.\nForgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,\r\n      snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer and\r\n      addressed him in French.\n“You are not wounded?” he asked.\n“I think not,” answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. “But I have\r\n      had a lucky escape this time,” he added, pointing to the damaged plaster\r\n      of the wall. “Who is that man?” said he, looking sternly at Pierre.\n“Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,” said Pierre rapidly,\r\n      quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. “He is an unfortunate\r\n      madman who did not know what he was doing.”\nThe officer went up to Makár Alexéevich and took him by the collar.\nMakár Alexéevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to\r\n      fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.\n“Brigand! You shall pay for this,” said the Frenchman, letting go of him.\r\n      “We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon traitors,” he\r\n      added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture.\nPierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that\r\n      drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the\r\n      same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For a\r\n      few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a\r\n      melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.\n“You have saved my life. You are French,” said he.\nFor a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman could\r\n      perform a great deed, and to save his life—the life of M. Ramballe,\r\n      captain of the 13th Light Regiment—was undoubtedly a very great\r\n      deed.\nBut however indubitable that conclusion and the officer’s conviction based\r\n      upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.\n“I am Russian,” he said quickly.\n“Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,” said the officer, waving his finger\r\n      before his nose and smiling. “You shall tell me all about that presently.\r\n      I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we to do with this\r\n      man?” he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a brother.\nEven if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest of\r\n      human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officer’s look and\r\n      tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who Makár\r\n      Alexéevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had\r\n      seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him,\r\n      and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.\nThe Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his arm.\n“You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it\r\n      you. Lead that man away!” said he quickly and energetically, and taking\r\n      the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his\r\n      life, he went with him into the room.\nThe soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking\r\n      what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits,\r\n      but the officer sternly checked them.\n“You will be called in when you are wanted,” he said.\nThe soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had time\r\n      to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.\n“Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,” said he.\r\n      “Shall I serve them up?”\n“Yes, and some wine,” answered the captain."

    "text": "When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again\r\n      thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to go\r\n      away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite,\r\n      amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his\r\n      life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in the\r\n      parlor—the first room they entered. To Pierre’s assurances that he\r\n      was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone\r\n      could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and\r\n      said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be\r\n      so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for\r\n      saving his life.\nHad this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the\r\n      feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre’s feelings\r\n      were, the latter would probably have left him, but the man’s animated\r\n      obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.\n“A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,” said the officer, looking at\r\n      Pierre’s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger. “I owe my\r\n      life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never forgets either\r\n      an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That is all I can say.”\nThere was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the\r\n      word) in the officer’s voice, in the expression of his face and in his\r\n      gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the\r\n      Frenchman’s smile, pressed the hand held out to him.\n“Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion of\r\n      Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,” he introduced himself,\r\n      a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his\r\n      mustache. “Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the\r\n      honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with\r\n      that maniac’s bullet in my body?”\nPierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing, began to\r\n      try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for concealing\r\n      it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.\n“Oh, please!” said he. “I understand your reasons. You are an officer... a\r\n      superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. That’s not my\r\n      business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at your\r\n      service. You belong to the gentry?” he concluded with a shade of inquiry\r\n      in his tone. Pierre bent his head. “Your baptismal name, if you please.\r\n      That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That’s all I want to\r\n      know.”\nWhen the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka\r\n      brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar\r\n      and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and\r\n      himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man,\r\n      munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking his\r\n      lips, and repeating—“Excellent! Delicious!” His face grew red and\r\n      was covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner\r\n      with pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan\r\n      and placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass,\r\n      taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known to\r\n      the French and had been given a special name. They called itlimonade de\r\n      cochon(pig’s lemonade), and Morel spoke well of thelimonade de\r\n      cochonhe had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they had\r\n      taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and applied\r\n      himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up to its neck in\r\n      a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for Pierre. The\r\n      satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain still more\r\n      lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.\n“Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for saving\r\n      me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my body already.\r\n      Here is one I got at Wagram” (he touched his side) “and a second at\r\n      Smolénsk”—he showed a scar on his cheek—“and this leg which as\r\n      you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great\r\n      battle of la Moskowa.Sacré Dieu!It was splendid! That deluge of fire was\r\n      worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may be\r\n      proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I\r\n      should be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see it.”\n“I was there,” said Pierre.\n“Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The great\r\n      redoubt held out well, by my pipe!” continued the Frenchman. “And you made\r\n      us pay dear for it. I was at it three times—sure as I sit here.\r\n      Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back like\r\n      cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your grenadiers\r\n      were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six times in\r\n      succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of Naples,\r\n      who knows what’s what, cried ‘Bravo!’ Ha, ha! So you are one of us\r\n      soldiers!” he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. “So much the\r\n      better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle...\r\n      gallant... with the fair” (he winked and smiled), “that’s what the French\r\n      are, Monsieur Pierre, aren’t they?”\nThe captain was so naïvely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so pleased\r\n      with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily at him.\r\n      Probably the word “gallant” turned the captain’s thoughts to the state of\r\n      Moscow.\n“Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left Moscow?\r\n      What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?”\n“Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?”\r\n       asked Pierre.\n“Ha, ha, ha!” The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting\r\n      Pierre on the shoulder. “What a thing to say!” he exclaimed. “Paris?...\r\n      But Paris, Paris...”\n“Paris—the capital of the world,” Pierre finished his remark for\r\n      him.\nThe captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the\r\n      middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.\n“Well, if you hadn’t told me you were Russian, I should have wagered that\r\n      you were Parisian! You have that... I don’t know what, that...” and having\r\n      uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.\n“I have been in Paris. I spent years there,” said Pierre.\n“Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn’t know Paris is\r\n      a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la\r\n      Duchénois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,” and noticing that his\r\n      conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly: “There\r\n      is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have remained\r\n      Russian. Well, I don’t esteem you the less for it.”\nUnder the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had\r\n      spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed\r\n      talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.\n“To return to your ladies—I hear they are lovely. What a wretched\r\n      idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in\r\n      Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, now—that’s\r\n      another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better than\r\n      that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all the\r\n      world’s capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to know.\r\n      And then the Emperor...” he began, but Pierre interrupted him.\n“The Emperor,” Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and\r\n      embarrassed, “is the Emperor...?”\n“The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius—that’s\r\n      what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you I\r\n      was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But\r\n      that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist\r\n      the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France. When\r\n      I understood what he wanted—when I saw that he was preparing a bed\r\n      of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: ‘That is a monarch,’ and I\r\n      devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes,mon cher, he is the greatest man\r\n      of the ages past or future.”\n“Is he in Moscow?” Pierre stammered with a guilty look.\nThe Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.\n“No, he will make his entry tomorrow,” he replied, and continued his talk.\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the\r\n      gate and by Morel, who came to say that some Württemberg hussars had come\r\n      and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain’s horses\r\n      were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not\r\n      understand what was said to them in French.\nThe captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice\r\n      asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer,\r\n      and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already\r\n      occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first\r\n      questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding\r\n      officer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand\r\n      said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the\r\n      quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to occupy\r\n      all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German, translated what\r\n      the German said to the captain and gave the captain’s reply to the\r\n      Württemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what was said to him,\r\n      the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The captain went out into\r\n      the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.\nWhen he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as\r\n      before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He\r\n      really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he was\r\n      left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he was\r\n      in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy conquerors\r\n      were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as that was it was\r\n      not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was tormented by the\r\n      consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of wine he had drunk\r\n      and the conversation with this good-natured man had destroyed the mood of\r\n      concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last few days and which was\r\n      essential for the execution of his design. The pistol, dagger, and peasant\r\n      coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the town next day. Pierre still\r\n      considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the\r\n      evildoer, but now he felt that he would not do it. He did not know why,\r\n      but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention. He\r\n      struggled against the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he\r\n      could not overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind, concerning\r\n      vengeance, killing, and self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by\r\n      contact with the first man he met.\nThe captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.\nThe Frenchman’s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled\r\n      him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which he\r\n      twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. “I will go away\r\n      immediately. I won’t say another word to him,” thought Pierre. He thought\r\n      this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of weakness tied\r\n      him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but could not do so.\nThe captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and down\r\n      the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he were\r\n      smiling to himself at some amusing thought.\n“The colonel of those Württembergers is delightful,” he suddenly said.\r\n      “He’s a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he’s a German.” He\r\n      sat down facing Pierre. “By the way, you know German, then?”\nPierre looked at him in silence.\n“What is the German for ‘shelter’?”\n“Shelter?” Pierre repeated. “The German for shelter isUnterkunft.”\n“How do you say it?” the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.\n“Unterkunft,”Pierre repeated.\n“Onterkoff,” said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with\r\n      laughing eyes. “These Germans are first-rate fools, don’t you think so,\r\n      Monsieur Pierre?” he concluded.\n“Well, let’s have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we? Morel\r\n      will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!” he called out gaily.\nMorel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre\r\n      by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on\r\n      his companion’s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in his\r\n      face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.\n“There now, we’re sad,” said he, touching Pierre’s hand. “Have I upset\r\n      you? No, really, have you anything against me?” he asked Pierre. “Perhaps\r\n      it’s the state of affairs?”\nPierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman’s eyes\r\n      whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.\n“Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for you.\r\n      Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death. I say\r\n      it with my hand on my heart!” said he, striking his chest.\n“Thank you,” said Pierre.\nThe captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that\r\n      “shelter” wasUnterkunftin German, and his face suddenly brightened.\n“Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!” he cried gaily, filling\r\n      two glasses with wine.\nPierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too,\r\n      again pressed Pierre’s hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a\r\n      pensive attitude.\n“Yes, my dear friend,” he began, “such is fortune’s caprice. Who would\r\n      have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the\r\n      service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow with\r\n      him. I must tell you,mon cher,” he continued in the sad and measured\r\n      tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, “that our name is one of\r\n      the most ancient in France.”\nAnd with a Frenchman’s easy and naïve frankness the captain told Pierre\r\n      the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all\r\n      about his relations and his financial and family affairs,“ma pauvre mère”playing of course an important part in the story.\n“But all that is only life’s setting, the real thing is love—love!\r\n      Am I not right, Monsieur Pierre?” said he, growing animated. “Another\r\n      glass?”\nPierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.\n“Oh, women, women!” and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at\r\n      Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.\nThere were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking at the\r\n      officer’s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager enthusiasm\r\n      with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe’s love stories had the\r\n      sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry\r\n      of love, yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone\r\n      had experienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so\r\n      alluringly that Pierre listened to him with curiosity.\nIt was plain thatl’amourwhich the Frenchman was so fond of was not\r\n      that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor was it the\r\n      romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for Natásha.\r\n      (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one he considered\r\n      the “love of clodhoppers” and the other the “love of\r\n      simpletons.”)L’amourwhich the Frenchman worshiped consisted\r\n      principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination\r\n      of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.\nThus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a\r\n      fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming,\r\n      innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The\r\n      conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in the\r\n      mother’s sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her\r\n      lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of a\r\n      distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played the\r\n      part of the lover, and he—the lover—assumed the role of the\r\n      husband, as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of\r\n      Germany, where “shelter” is calledUnterkunftand where the\r\n      husbands eat sauerkraut and the young girls are “too blonde.”\nFinally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain’s memory,\r\n      and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was of how he\r\n      had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of life continually\r\n      occurred in the captain’s stories) and the Pole had entrusted to him his\r\n      enchanting wife (parisienne de cœur) while himself entering the French\r\n      service. The captain was happy, the enchanting Polish lady wished to elope\r\n      with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to\r\n      the husband, saying as he did so: “I have saved your life, and I save your\r\n      honor!” Having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave\r\n      himself a shake, as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at\r\n      this touching recollection.\nListening to the captain’s tales, Pierre—as often happens late in\r\n      the evening and under the influence of wine—followed all that was\r\n      told him, understood it all, and at the same time followed a train of\r\n      personal memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind.\r\n      While listening to these love stories his own love for Natásha\r\n      unexpectedly rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in\r\n      his imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe’s tales. Listening\r\n      to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before his\r\n      eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of his love\r\n      at the Súkharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had not\r\n      produced an effect upon him—he had not even once recalled it. But\r\n      now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very\r\n      important and poetic.\n“Peter Kirílovich, come here! We have recognized you,” he now seemed to\r\n      hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her smile,\r\n      her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there seemed to\r\n      him something pathetic and touching in all this.\nHaving finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain\r\n      asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice\r\n      himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.\nChallenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to\r\n      express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he\r\n      understood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all his\r\n      life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could never\r\n      be his.\n“Tiens!”said the captain.\nPierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest\r\n      years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too\r\n      young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.\r\n      Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of\r\n      her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in the\r\n      world, and especially therefore above himself.\nWhen he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he\r\n      understood that.\nThe captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand\r\n      it he begged Pierre to continue.\n“Platónic love, clouds...” he muttered.\nWhether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the\r\n      thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who\r\n      played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together,\r\n      something loosened Pierre’s tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway\r\n      look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his\r\n      marriage, Natásha’s love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and all\r\n      his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe’s questions he\r\n      also told what he had at first concealed—his own position and even\r\n      his name.\nMore than anything else in Pierre’s story the captain was impressed by the\r\n      fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that he\r\n      had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there\r\n      concealing his name and station.\nWhen it was late at night they went out together into the street. The\r\n      night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokróvka a fire\r\n      glowed—the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the\r\n      right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and\r\n      opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierre’s\r\n      heart with his love. At the gate stood Gerásim, the cook, and two\r\n      Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in\r\n      two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the\r\n      town.\nThere was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense\r\n      city.\nGazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the glow\r\n      from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. “There now, how good\r\n      it is, what more does one need?” thought he. And suddenly remembering his\r\n      intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence\r\n      to save himself from falling.\nWithout taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with unsteady\r\n      steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell\r\n      asleep."

    "text": "The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was\r\n      watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the\r\n      retreating troops, with many different feelings.\nThe Rostóv party spent the night at Mytíshchi, fourteen miles from Moscow.\r\n      They had started so late on the first of September, the road had been so\r\n      blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been forgotten for\r\n      which servants were sent back, that they had decided to spend that night\r\n      at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning they woke late and\r\n      were again delayed so often that they only got as far as Great Mytíshchi.\r\n      At ten o’clock that evening the Rostóv family and the wounded traveling\r\n      with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large\r\n      village. The Rostóvs’ servants and coachmen and the orderlies of the\r\n      wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had supper, fed the\r\n      horses, and came out into the porches.\nIn a neighboring hut lay Raévski’s adjutant with a fractured wrist. The\r\n      awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his\r\n      moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had spent\r\n      the first night in the same yard as the Rostóvs. The countess said she had\r\n      been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at Mytíshchi\r\n      she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man.\nIn the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high\r\n      body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another fire.\r\n      One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was Little\r\n      Mytíshchi burning—set on fire by Mamónov’s Cossacks.\n“But look here, brothers, there’s another fire!” remarked an orderly.\nAll turned their attention to the glow.\n“But they told us Little Mytíshchi had been set on fire by Mamónov’s\r\n      Cossacks.”\n“But that’s not Mytíshchi, it’s farther away.”\n“Look, it must be in Moscow!”\nTwo of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down\r\n      on its steps.\n“It’s more to the left, why, Little Mytíshchi is over there, and this is\r\n      right on the other side.”\nSeveral men joined the first two.\n“See how it’s flaring,” said one. “That’s a fire in\r\n      Moscow: either in the Sushchévski or the Rogózhski quarter.”\nNo one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently at\r\n      the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.\nOld Daniel Teréntich, the count’s valet (as he was called), came up to the\r\n      group and shouted at Míshka.\n“What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be\r\n      calling and there’s nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.”\n“I only ran out to get some water,” said Míshka.\n“But what do you think, Daniel Teréntich? Doesn’t it look as if that glow\r\n      were in Moscow?” remarked one of the footmen.\nDaniel Teréntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all\r\n      silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.\n“God have mercy.... It’s windy and dry...” said another voice.\n“Just look! See what it’s doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows\r\n      flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!”\n“They’ll put it out, no fear!”\n“Who’s to put it out?” Daniel Teréntich, who had hitherto been silent, was\r\n      heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. “Moscow it is, brothers,”\r\n       said he. “Mother Moscow, the white...” his voice faltered, and he gave way\r\n      to an old man’s sob.\nAnd it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the\r\n      significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard,\r\n      words of prayer, and the sobbing of the count’s old valet."

    "text": "The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was\r\n      burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. Sónya\r\n      and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only\r\n      Natásha and the countess remained in the room. Pétya was no longer with\r\n      the family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for Tróitsa.\nThe countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. Natásha,\r\n      pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just\r\n      where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father’s\r\n      words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three\r\n      houses off.\n“Oh, how terrible,” said Sónya returning from the yard chilled and\r\n      frightened. “I believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there’s an awful\r\n      glow! Natásha, do look! You can see it from the window,” she said to her\r\n      cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.\nBut Natásha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her and\r\n      again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in this\r\n      condition of stupor since the morning, when Sónya, to the surprise and\r\n      annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found it\r\n      necessary to tell Natásha of Prince Andrew’s wound and of his being with\r\n      their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was\r\n      with Sónya. Sónya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now, as if\r\n      trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her cousin.\n“Look, Natásha, how dreadfully it is burning!” said she.\n“What’s burning?” asked Natásha. “Oh, yes, Moscow.”\nAnd as if in order not to offend Sónya and to get rid of her, she turned\r\n      her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident that\r\n      she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former attitude.\n“But you didn’t see it!”\n“Yes, really I did,” Natásha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in\r\n      peace.\nBoth the countess and Sónya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow nor\r\n      the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to\r\n      Natásha.\nThe count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went up\r\n      to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was\r\n      wont to do when Natásha was ill, then touched her forehead with her lips\r\n      as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.\n“You are cold. You are trembling all over. You’d better lie down,” said\r\n      the countess.\n“Lie down? All right, I will. I’ll lie down at once,” said Natásha.\nWhen Natásha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously\r\n      wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many\r\n      questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And\r\n      could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see him,\r\n      that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger, she\r\n      ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving what\r\n      they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would still be\r\n      told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach\r\n      with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the countess knew so\r\n      well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same way on the bench\r\n      where she had seated herself on arriving. She was planning something and\r\n      either deciding or had already decided something in her mind. The countess\r\n      knew this, but what it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and\r\n      tormented her.\n“Natásha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.”\nA bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss and\r\n      the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.\n“No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,” Natásha replied irritably\r\n      and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open window the\r\n      moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put her head out\r\n      into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with\r\n      sobs and throbbing against the window frame. Natásha knew it was not\r\n      Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in the same yard\r\n      as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage; but this\r\n      dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged a look\r\n      with Sónya.\n“Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,” said the countess, softly touching\r\n      Natásha’s shoulders. “Come, lie down.”\n“Oh, yes... I’ll lie down at once,” said Natásha, and began hurriedly\r\n      undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.\nWhen she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat\r\n      down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the\r\n      floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front, and\r\n      began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly unplaited,\r\n      replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side to side from\r\n      habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before her. When her\r\n      toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread\r\n      over the hay on the side nearest the door.\n“Natásha, you’d better lie in the middle,” said Sónya.\n“I’ll stay here,” muttered Natásha. “Do lie down,” she added crossly, and\r\n      buried her face in the pillow.\nThe countess, Madame Schoss, and Sónya undressed hastily and lay down. The\r\n      small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room. But\r\n      in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little Mytíshchi a mile and\r\n      a half away, and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a\r\n      tavern Mamónov’s Cossacks had set up across the street, and the adjutant’s\r\n      unceasing moans could still be heard.\nFor a long time Natásha listened attentively to the sounds that reached\r\n      her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard her\r\n      mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her, then\r\n      Madame Schoss’ familiar whistling snore and Sónya’s gentle breathing. Then\r\n      the countess called to Natásha. Natásha did not answer.\n“I think she’s asleep, Mamma,” said Sónya softly.\nAfter a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one\r\n      replied.\nSoon after that Natásha heard her mother’s even breathing. Natásha did not\r\n      move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt, was\r\n      growing cold on the bare floor.\nAs if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a crack\r\n      in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near by. The\r\n      shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the adjutant was\r\n      heard. Natásha sat up.\n“Sónya, are you asleep? Mamma?” she whispered.\nNo one replied. Natásha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and\r\n      stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple, bare\r\n      feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one foot\r\n      to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped\r\n      the cold door handle.\nIt seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all\r\n      the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and terror\r\n      and overflowing with love.\nShe opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,\r\n      damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With\r\n      her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened the\r\n      door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark in\r\n      there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which something\r\n      was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and smoldering wick.\nFrom the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew’s wound\r\n      and his presence there, Natásha had resolved to see him. She did not know\r\n      why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the more\r\n      convinced that it was necessary.\nAll day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now that\r\n      the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see. How\r\n      was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant moaning of\r\n      the adjutant’s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her imagination he\r\n      was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an indistinct shape in\r\n      the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his\r\n      shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood still in terror.\r\n      But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She cautiously took one step\r\n      and then another, and found herself in the middle of a small room\r\n      containing baggage. Another man—Timókhin—was lying in a corner\r\n      on the benches beneath the icons, and two others—the doctor and a\r\n      valet—lay on the floor.\nThe valet sat up and whispered something. Timókhin, kept awake by the pain\r\n      in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition\r\n      of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap. The valet’s\r\n      sleepy, frightened exclamation, “What do you want? What’s the matter?”\r\n       made Natásha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner.\r\n      Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him. She passed\r\n      the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw Prince Andrew\r\n      clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she had always seen\r\n      him.\nHe was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his\r\n      glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck,\r\n      delicate as a child’s, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt, gave\r\n      him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never seen on\r\n      him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible, youthful\r\n      movement dropped on her knees.\nHe smiled and held out his hand to her."

    "text": "Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the ambulance\r\n      station on the field of Borodinó. His feverish state and the inflammation\r\n      of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor’s opinion sure to\r\n      carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of\r\n      bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his temperature was\r\n      lower. He had regained consciousness that morning. The first night after\r\n      they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in thecalèche,\r\n      but at Mytíshchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given\r\n      some tea. The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan\r\n      aloud and again lose consciousness. When he had been placed on his camp\r\n      bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes. Then he opened\r\n      them and whispered softly: “And the tea?” His remembering such a small\r\n      detail of everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew’s\r\n      pulse, and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He\r\n      was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not\r\n      die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering. Timókhin,\r\n      the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew’s regiment, had joined him in Moscow\r\n      and was being taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the\r\n      battle of Borodinó. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew’s\r\n      valet, his coachman, and two orderlies.\nThey gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with\r\n      feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and\r\n      remember something.\n“I don’t want any more. Is Timókhin here?” he asked.\nTimókhin crept along the bench to him.\n“I am here, your excellency.”\n“How’s your wound?”\n“Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?”\nPrince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.\n“Couldn’t one get a book?” he asked.\n“What book?”\n“The Gospels. I haven’t one.”\nThe doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was\r\n      feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but\r\n      reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was\r\n      uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak\r\n      with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of\r\n      mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful\r\n      place. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a\r\n      change in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned\r\n      again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking\r\n      them to get him the book and put it under him.\n“What trouble would it be to you?” he said. “I have not got one. Please\r\n      get it for me and put it under for a moment,” he pleaded in a piteous\r\n      voice.\nThe doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.\n“You fellows have no conscience,” said he to the valet who was pouring\r\n      water over his hands. “For just one moment I didn’t look after you... It’s\r\n      such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.”\n“By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!” said\r\n      the valet.\nThe first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the\r\n      matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to\r\n      be carried into the hut after hiscalèchehad stopped at Mytíshchi. After\r\n      growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again\r\n      regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled all that\r\n      had happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the moment at the\r\n      ambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of a man he\r\n      disliked, those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness.\r\n      And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again possessed his\r\n      soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that\r\n      this happiness had something to do with the Gospels. That was why he asked\r\n      for a copy of them. The uncomfortable position in which they had put him\r\n      and turned him over again confused his thoughts, and when he came to\r\n      himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night.\r\n      Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket chirped from across the\r\n      passage; someone was shouting and singing in the street; cockroaches\r\n      rustled on the table, on the icons, and on the walls, and a big fly\r\n      flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him, the wick\r\n      of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom.\nHis mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,\r\n      feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the power\r\n      and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his\r\n      whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest\r\n      reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then\r\n      return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew’s mind was not in a\r\n      normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more active\r\n      and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most diverse\r\n      thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his brain\r\n      suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had never\r\n      reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the midst of its work it\r\n      would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it\r\n      back again.\n“Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived,”\r\n       he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut, gazing fixedly\r\n      before him with feverish wide open eyes. “A happiness lying beyond\r\n      material forces, outside the material influences that act on man—a\r\n      happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man can\r\n      understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for God.\r\n      But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?”\nAnd suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew\r\n      heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a soft\r\n      whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating “piti-piti-piti,”\r\n       and then “titi,” and then again “piti-piti-piti,” and “ti-ti” once more.\r\n      At the same time he felt that above his face, above the very middle of it,\r\n      some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or\r\n      splinters, to the sound of this whispered music. He felt that he had to\r\n      balance carefully (though it was difficult) so that this airy structure\r\n      should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly\r\n      rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic music—“it stretches,\r\n      stretches, spreading out and stretching,” said Prince Andrew to himself.\r\n      While listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this\r\n      drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles, he also saw\r\n      by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and heard the rustle of the\r\n      cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and\r\n      his face. Each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning\r\n      sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure, though\r\n      it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising. But\r\n      besides this there was something else of importance. It was something\r\n      white by the door—the statue of a sphinx, which also oppressed him.\n“But perhaps that’s my shirt on the table,” he thought, “and that’s my\r\n      legs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing\r\n      itself out, and ‘piti-piti-piti’ and ‘ti-ti’ and ‘piti-piti-piti’...?\r\n      That’s enough, please leave off!” Prince Andrew painfully entreated\r\n      someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of\r\n      his mind with peculiar clearness and force.\n“Yes—love,” he thought again quite clearly. “But not love which\r\n      loves for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some\r\n      reason, but the love which I—while dying—first experienced\r\n      when I saw my enemy and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love\r\n      which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now\r\n      again I feel that bliss. To love one’s neighbors, to love one’s enemies,\r\n      to love everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible\r\n      to love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be\r\n      loved by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that\r\n      I loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...\n“When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but divine\r\n      love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can destroy it. It\r\n      is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have I hated in my\r\n      life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did her.” And he\r\n      vividly pictured to himself Natásha, not as he had done in the past with\r\n      nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for the first time\r\n      picturing to himself her soul. And he understood her feelings, her\r\n      sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the first time all\r\n      the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his rupture with her.\r\n      “If only it were possible for me to see her once more! Just once, looking\r\n      into those eyes to say...”\n“Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!” flopped the\r\n      fly.... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world\r\n      of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In that\r\n      world some structure was still being erected and did not fall, something was\r\n      still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo was still burning,\r\n      and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but besides all this\r\n      something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx\r\n      appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had the pale face and\r\n      shining eyes of the very Natásha of whom he had just been thinking.\n“Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,” thought Prince Andrew,\r\n      trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained\r\n      before him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew wished\r\n      to return to that former world of pure thought, but he could not, and\r\n      delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice\r\n      continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched out,\r\n      and the strange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all his\r\n      strength in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and\r\n      suddenly there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and like\r\n      a man plunged into water he lost consciousness. When he came to himself,\r\n      Natásha, that same living Natásha whom of all people he most longed to\r\n      love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him, was\r\n      kneeling before him. He realized that it was the real living Natásha, and\r\n      he was not surprised but quietly happy. Natásha, motionless on her knees\r\n      (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes riveted on him, was\r\n      restraining her sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the lower part\r\n      of it something quivered.\nPrince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.\n“You?” he said. “How fortunate!”\nWith a rapid but careful movement Natásha drew nearer to him on her knees\r\n      and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began kissing\r\n      it, just touching it lightly with her lips.\n“Forgive me!” she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.\r\n      “Forgive me!”\n“I love you,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Forgive...!”\n“Forgive what?” he asked.\n“Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!” faltered Natásha in a scarcely\r\n      audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just\r\n      touching it with her lips.\n“I love you more, better than before,” said Prince Andrew, lifting her\r\n      face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.\nThose eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,\r\n      compassionately, and with joyous love. Natásha’s thin pale face, with its\r\n      swollen lips, was more than plain—it was dreadful. But Prince Andrew\r\n      did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful. They heard\r\n      the sound of voices behind them.\nPeter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor. Timókhin,\r\n      who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had long been\r\n      watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare body with the\r\n      sheet as he huddled up on his bench.\n“What’s this?” said the doctor, rising from his bed. “Please go away,\r\n      madam!”\nAt that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her daughter’s\r\n      absence, knocked at the door.\nLike a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natásha went out of the room\r\n      and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.\nFrom that time, during all the rest of the Rostóvs’ journey, at every\r\n      halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natásha never left the\r\n      wounded Bolkónski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected\r\n      from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded\r\n      man.\nDreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die in\r\n      her daughter’s arms during the journey—as, judging by what the\r\n      doctor said, it seemed might easily happen—she could not oppose\r\n      Natásha. Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man\r\n      and Natásha the thought occurred that should he recover their former\r\n      engagement would be renewed, no one—least of all Natásha and Prince\r\n      Andrew—spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and death,\r\n      which hung not only over Bolkónski but over all Russia, shut out all other\r\n      considerations."

    "text": "On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the\r\n      clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his\r\n      body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had\r\n      done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterday’s\r\n      conversation with Captain Ramballe.\nIt was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors.\r\n      Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock\r\n      which Gerásim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered where he\r\n      was and what lay before him that very day.\n“Am I not too late?” he thought. “No, probablyhewon’t make his entry into Moscow before noon.”\nPierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but\r\n      hastened to act.\nAfter arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out.\r\n      But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not\r\n      carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult to hide\r\n      such a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not carry it\r\n      unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been discharged,\r\n      and he had not had time to reload it. “No matter, the dagger will\r\n      do,” he said to himself, though when planning his design he had more than\r\n      once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809\r\n      had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as his chief aim consisted\r\n      not in carrying out his design, but in proving to himself that he would not\r\n      abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it, Pierre\r\n      hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought\r\n      at the Súkharev market with the pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat.\nHaving tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,\r\n      Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting\r\n      the captain, and passed out into the street.\nThe conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the\r\n      evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on fire\r\n      in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river, in the\r\n      Bazaar and the Povarskóy, as well as the barges on the Moskvá River and\r\n      the timber yards by the Dorogomílov Bridge, were all ablaze.\nPierre’s way led through side streets to the Povarskóy and from there to\r\n      the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbát, where he had long before decided\r\n      that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses were locked\r\n      and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted. The air was full\r\n      of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met Russians with\r\n      anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of the city but of\r\n      the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both the Russians and the\r\n      French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his height and stoutness,\r\n      and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure, the\r\n      Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to what class he\r\n      could belong. The French followed him with astonishment in their eyes\r\n      chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the\r\n      French with fear and curiosity, paid no attention to them. At the gate of\r\n      one house three Frenchmen, who were explaining something to some Russians\r\n      who did not understand them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know\r\n      French.\nPierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel\r\n      standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout\r\n      was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man’s musket as\r\n      he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side\r\n      of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around\r\n      him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like\r\n      something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night’s\r\n      experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring\r\n      his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by\r\n      anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out,\r\n      for Napoleon had passed the Arbát more than four hours previously on his\r\n      way from the Dorogomílov suburb to the Krémlin, and was now sitting in a\r\n      very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Krémlin, giving detailed\r\n      and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the\r\n      fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre did\r\n      not know this; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him, and was\r\n      tortured—as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is\r\n      impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its\r\n      incompatibility with their natures—by the fear of weakening at the\r\n      decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.\nThough he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct\r\n      and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskóy.\nAs Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser—he\r\n      even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose\r\n      from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets and\r\n      they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something unusual\r\n      was happening around him, did not realize that he was approaching the\r\n      fire. As he was going along a footpath across a wide-open space adjoining\r\n      the Povarskóy on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruzínski’s house on\r\n      the other, Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to\r\n      him. He stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head.\nBy the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household\r\n      goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the\r\n      ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,\r\n      prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman,\r\n      swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two\r\n      girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks,\r\n      were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale\r\n      frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an\r\n      overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his old\r\n      nurse’s arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk, and, having\r\n      undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight and sniffing at her\r\n      singed hair. The woman’s husband, a short, round-shouldered man in the\r\n      undress uniform of a civilian official, with sausage-shaped whiskers and\r\n      showing under his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over\r\n      his temples, with expressionless face was moving the trunks, which were\r\n      placed one on another, and was dragging some garments from under them.\nAs soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.\n“Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help us,\r\n      somebody,” she muttered between her sobs. “My girl... My daughter! My\r\n      youngest daughter is left behind. She’s burned! Ooh! Was it for this I\r\n      nursed you.... Ooh!”\n“Don’t, Mary Nikoláevna!” said her husband to her in a low voice,\r\n      evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. “Sister must have\r\n      taken her, or else where can she be?” he added.\n“Monster! Villain!” shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep.\r\n      “You have no heart, you don’t feel for your own child! Another man would\r\n      have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a man\r\n      nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,” she went on, addressing\r\n      Pierre rapidly between her sobs. “The fire broke out alongside, and blew\r\n      our way, the maid called out ‘Fire!’ and we rushed to collect our things.\r\n      We ran out just as we were.... This is what we have brought away.... The\r\n      icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost. We seized the children. But\r\n      not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...” and again she began to sob. “My child, my dear\r\n      one! Burned, burned!”\n“But where was she left?” asked Pierre.\nFrom the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might\r\n      help her.\n“Oh, dear sir!” she cried, seizing him by the legs. “My benefactor, set my\r\n      heart at ease.... Aníska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!” she\r\n      cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing\r\n      her long teeth.\n“Show me the way, show me, I... I’ll do it,” gasped Pierre rapidly.\nThe dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait,\r\n      sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt as if\r\n      he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head higher, his\r\n      eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps he followed the\r\n      maid, overtook her, and came out on the Povarskóy. The whole street was\r\n      full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here and there broke\r\n      through that cloud. A great number of people crowded in front of the\r\n      conflagration. In the middle of the street stood a French general saying\r\n      something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the maid, was\r\n      advancing to the spot where the general stood, but the French soldiers\r\n      stopped him.\n“On ne passe pas!”* cried a voice.\n* “You can’t pass!”\n“This way, uncle,” cried the girl. “We’ll pass through\r\n      the side street, by the Nikúlins’!”\nPierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her. She\r\n      ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and, passing\r\n      three houses, turned into a yard on the right.\n“It’s here, close by,” said she and, running across the yard, opened a\r\n      gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden\r\n      wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its\r\n      sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from\r\n      the openings of the windows and from under the roof.\nAs Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and\r\n      involuntarily stopped.\n“Which is it? Which is your house?” he asked.\n“Ooh!” wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. “That’s it, that was our\r\n      lodging. You’ve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little\r\n      missy! Ooh!” lamented Aníska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she\r\n      too must give expression to her feelings.\nPierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he involuntarily\r\n      passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet\r\n      burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around which swarmed a\r\n      crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize what these men, who\r\n      were dragging something out, were about; but seeing before him a Frenchman\r\n      hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur\r\n      coat, he vaguely understood that looting was going on there, but he had no\r\n      time to dwell on that idea.\nThe sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the\r\n      whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and the\r\n      sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds and now\r\n      soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense sheaves of\r\n      flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls),\r\n      and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the\r\n      usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a peculiarly strong\r\n      effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly\r\n      freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt young, bright,\r\n      adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was\r\n      about to dash into that part of it which was still standing, when just\r\n      above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound\r\n      and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him.\nPierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen who\r\n      had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal articles.\r\n      Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.\n“What does this fellow want?” shouted one of them referring to Pierre.\n“There’s a child in that house. Haven’t you seen a child?” cried Pierre.\n“What’s he talking about? Get along!” said several voices, and one of the\r\n      soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from them some\r\n      of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved threateningly\r\n      toward him.\n“A child?” shouted a Frenchman from above. “I did hear something squealing\r\n      in the garden. Perhaps it’s his brat that the fellow is looking for. After\r\n      all, one must be human, you know....”\n“Where is it? Where?” said Pierre.\n“There! There!” shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the\r\n      garden at the back of the house. “Wait a bit—I’m coming down.”\nAnd a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot\r\n      on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the\r\n      ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the\r\n      garden.\n“Hurry up, you others!” he called out to his comrades. “It’s getting hot.”\nWhen they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled\r\n      Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a\r\n      three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.\n“There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!” said the Frenchman.\r\n      “Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you know!” and the\r\n      Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades.\nBreathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take\r\n      her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking\r\n      child, unattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away. Pierre,\r\n      however, seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed desperately\r\n      and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre’s hands away\r\n      and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized by a sense\r\n      of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some\r\n      nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw the child down and\r\n      ran with her to the large house. It was now, however, impossible to get\r\n      back the way he had come; the maid, Aníska, was no longer there, and\r\n      Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet, painfully\r\n      sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through\r\n      the garden seeking another way out."

    "text": "Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back with\r\n      his little burden to the Gruzínski garden at the corner of the Povarskóy.\r\n      He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look\r\n      for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been\r\n      dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian families who had taken refuge\r\n      here from the fire with their belongings, there were several French\r\n      soldiers in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He\r\n      hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the\r\n      daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre felt that he\r\n      had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the heat and from\r\n      running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of\r\n      youth, animation, and determination that had come on him when he ran to\r\n      save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging with her little\r\n      hands to Pierre’s coat, sat on his arm gazing about her like some little\r\n      wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile. He\r\n      fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened, sickly\r\n      little face.\nHe did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He\r\n      walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he\r\n      met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family consisting of\r\n      a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new, cloth-covered,\r\n      sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar type, and a young\r\n      woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental\r\n      beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched, black eyebrows and the\r\n      extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long, beautiful, expressionless\r\n      face. Amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space, she, in\r\n      her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head, suggested a\r\n      delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow. She was sitting on some\r\n      bundles a little behind the old woman, and looked from under her long\r\n      lashes with motionless, large, almond-shaped eyes at the ground before\r\n      her. Evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her\r\n      face struck Pierre and, hurrying along by the fence, he turned several\r\n      times to look at her. When he had reached the fence, still without finding\r\n      those he sought, he stopped and looked about him.\nWith the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than\r\n      before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.\n“Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You’re of the gentry yourself,\r\n      aren’t you? Whose child is it?” they asked him.\nPierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had\r\n      been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether anyone\r\n      knew where she had gone.\n“Why, that must be the Anférovs,” said an old deacon, addressing a\r\n      pockmarked peasant woman. “Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!” he added in\r\n      his customary bass.\n“The Anférovs? No,” said the woman. “They left in the morning. That must\r\n      be either Mary Nikoláevna’s or the Ivánovs’!”\n“He says ‘a woman,’ and Mary Nikoláevna is a lady,” remarked a house serf.\n“Do you know her? She’s thin, with long teeth,” said Pierre.\n“That’s Mary Nikoláevna! They went inside the garden when these wolves\r\n      swooped down,” said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.\n“O Lord, have mercy!” added the deacon.\n“Go over that way, they’re there. It’s she! She kept on lamenting and\r\n      crying,” continued the woman. “It’s she. Here, this way!”\nBut Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been\r\n      intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at\r\n      the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them.\r\n      One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round the\r\n      waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare.\r\n      The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a long, lank,\r\n      round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements and with an\r\n      idiotic expression of face. He wore a woman’s loose gown of frieze, blue\r\n      trousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The little barefooted Frenchman in\r\n      the blue coat went up to the Armenians and, saying something, immediately\r\n      seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off\r\n      his boots. The other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful\r\n      Armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her,\r\n      motionless and silent.\n“Here, take the child!” said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the\r\n      woman, handing the little girl to her. “Give her back to them, give her\r\n      back!” he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the\r\n      ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.\nThe old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had secured\r\n      his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other. The old man\r\n      was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre caught but a\r\n      glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the Frenchman in the\r\n      frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to side, had drawn\r\n      nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized\r\n      her by the neck.\nThe beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude, with\r\n      her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier\r\n      was doing to her.\nWhile Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the\r\n      Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from\r\n      her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young woman,\r\n      clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.\n“Let that woman alone!” exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice,\r\n      seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.\nThe soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down the\r\n      boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.\n“Voyons, pas de bêtises!”* he cried.\n* “Look here, no nonsense!”\nPierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his\r\n      strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman and,\r\n      before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his feet and\r\n      hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd\r\n      around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared\r\n      from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the\r\n      Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing of what happened\r\n      after that. He only remembered beating someone and being beaten and\r\n      finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French\r\n      soldiers stood around him and were searching him.\n“Lieutenant, he has a dagger,” were the first words Pierre understood.\n“Ah, a weapon?” said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who\r\n      had been arrested with Pierre. “All right, you can tell all about it at\r\n      the court-martial.” Then he turned to Pierre. “Do you speak French?”\nPierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His face\r\n      probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in a whisper\r\n      and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of\r\n      Pierre.\n“Do you speak French?” the officer asked again, keeping at a distance from\r\n      Pierre. “Call the interpreter.”\nA little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and by\r\n      his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a French\r\n      salesman from one of the Moscow shops.\n“He does not look like a common man,” said the interpreter, after a\r\n      searching look at Pierre.\n“Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary,” remarked the officer. “And\r\n      ask him who he is,” he added.\n“Who are you?” asked the interpreter in poor Russian. “You must answer the\r\n      chief.”\n“I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner—take me!” Pierre\r\n      suddenly replied in French.\n“Ah, ah!” muttered the officer with a frown. “Well then, march!”\nA crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the\r\n      pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol started\r\n      she moved forward.\n“Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?” said she. “And the little\r\n      girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she’s not theirs?” said\r\n      the woman.\n“What does that woman want?” asked the officer.\nPierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight of the\r\n      little girl he had saved.\n“What does she want?” he murmured. “She is bringing me my daughter whom I\r\n      have just saved from the flames,” said he. “Good-by!” And without knowing\r\n      how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along with resolute and\r\n      triumphant steps between the French soldiers.\nThe French patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets of\r\n      Moscow by Durosnel’s order to put a stop to the pillage, and especially to\r\n      catch the incendiaries who, according to the general opinion which had\r\n      that day originated among the higher French officers, were the cause of\r\n      the conflagrations. After marching through a number of streets the patrol\r\n      arrested five more Russian suspects: a small shopkeeper, two seminary\r\n      students, a peasant, and a house serf, besides several looters. But of all\r\n      these various suspected characters, Pierre was considered to be the most\r\n      suspicious of all. When they had all been brought for the night to a large\r\n      house on the Zúbov Rampart that was being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was\r\n      placed apart under strict guard."

    "text": "In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on\r\n      with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between the parties of\r\n      Rumyántsev, the French, Márya Fëdorovna, the Tsarévich, and others,\r\n      drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm,\r\n      luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and\r\n      reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made it hard, except\r\n      by a great effort, to realize the danger and the difficult position of the\r\n      Russian people. There were the same receptions and balls, the same French\r\n      theater, the same court interests and service interests and intrigues as\r\n      usual. Only in the very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind\r\n      the difficulties of the actual position. Stories were whispered of how\r\n      differently the two Empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances.\r\n      The Empress Márya, concerned for the welfare of the charitable and\r\n      educational institutions under her patronage, had given directions that\r\n      they should all be removed to Kazán, and the things belonging to these\r\n      institutions had already been packed up. The Empress Elisabeth, however,\r\n      when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give—with her\r\n      characteristic Russian patriotism had replied that she could give no\r\n      directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the\r\n      sovereign, but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the\r\n      last to quit Petersburg.\nAt Anna Pávlovna’s on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of the\r\n      battle of Borodinó, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which was to\r\n      be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending the\r\n      Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a model of\r\n      ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince Vasíli himself, famed for his\r\n      elocution, was to read it. (He used to read at the Empress’.) The art of\r\n      his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite\r\n      independently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating\r\n      between a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell quite\r\n      at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading, as was\r\n      always the case at Anna Pávlovna’s soirees, had a political significance.\r\n      That evening she expected several important personages who had to be made\r\n      ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused to a patriotic\r\n      temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna Pávlovna, not yet\r\n      seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room, did not let the\r\n      reading begin but wound up the springs of a general conversation.\nThe news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezúkhova.\r\n      She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed several\r\n      gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said to be receiving\r\n      no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors who usually\r\n      attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who was treating\r\n      her in some new and unusual way.\nThey all knew very well that the enchanting countess’ illness arose from\r\n      an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time,\r\n      and that the Italian’s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience; but\r\n      in Anna Pávlovna’s presence no one dared to think of this or even appear\r\n      to know it.\n“They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina\r\n      pectoris.”\n“Angina? Oh, that’s a terrible illness!”\n“They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...” and\r\n      the wordanginawas repeated with great satisfaction.\n“The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor\r\n      told him the case was dangerous.”\n“Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.”\n“You are speaking of the poor countess?” said Anna Pávlovna, coming up\r\n      just then. “I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little better.\r\n      Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the world,” she went on,\r\n      with a smile at her own enthusiasm. “We belong to different camps, but\r\n      that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She is very\r\n      unfortunate!” added Anna Pávlovna.\nSupposing that by these words Anna Pávlovna was somewhat lifting the veil\r\n      from the secret of the countess’ malady, an unwary young man ventured to\r\n      express surprise that well-known doctors had not been called in and that\r\n      the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might employ dangerous\r\n      remedies.\n“Your information may be better than mine,” Anna Pávlovna suddenly and\r\n      venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, “but I know on good\r\n      authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He is private\r\n      physician to the Queen of Spain.”\nAnd having thus demolished the young man, Anna Pávlovna turned to another\r\n      group where Bilíbin was talking about the Austrians: having wrinkled up\r\n      his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again and utter one\r\n      of his mots.\n“I think it is delightful,” he said, referring to a diplomatic note that\r\n      had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the\r\n      French by Wittgenstein, “the hero of Petropol” as he was then called in\r\n      Petersburg.\n“What? What’s that?” asked Anna Pávlovna, securing silence for the mot,\r\n      which she had heard before.\nAnd Bilíbin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, which he\r\n      had himself composed.\n“The Emperor returns these Austrian banners,” said Bilíbin, “friendly\r\n      banners gone astray and found on a wrong path,” and his brow became smooth\r\n      again.\n“Charming, charming!” observed Prince Vasíli.\n“The path to Warsaw, perhaps,” Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and\r\n      unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant. Prince\r\n      Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise. He knew no more\r\n      than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career he had\r\n      more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty,\r\n      and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that\r\n      entered his head. “It may turn out very well,” he thought, “but if not,\r\n      they’ll know how to arrange matters.” And really, during the awkward\r\n      silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom\r\n      Anna Pávlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert, and she, smiling\r\n      and shaking a finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince Vasíli to the table and\r\n      bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin. Everyone\r\n      became silent.\n“Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!” Prince Vasíli sternly declaimed,\r\n      looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had anything\r\n      to say to the contrary. But no one said anything. “Moscow, our ancient\r\n      capital, the New Jerusalem, receivesherChrist”—he placed a sudden\r\n      emphasis on the wordher—“as a mother receives her zealous sons into\r\n      her arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant glory\r\n      of thy rule, sings in exultation, ‘Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh!’”\nPrince Vasíli pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.\nBilíbin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present appeared\r\n      intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna Pávlovna\r\n      whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman muttering the\r\n      prayer at Communion: “Let the bold and insolent Goliath...” she whispered.\nPrince Vasíli continued.\n“Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass\r\n      the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling\r\n      of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty\r\n      pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and zealous\r\n      champion of old of our country’s weal, is offered to Your Imperial\r\n      Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight\r\n      of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the\r\n      Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully fulfill the\r\n      desires of Your Majesty.”\n“What force! What a style!” was uttered in approval both of reader and of\r\n      author.\nAnimated by that address Anna Pávlovna’s guests talked for a long time of\r\n      the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the\r\n      result of the battle to be fought in a few days.\n“You will see,” said Anna Pávlovna, “that tomorrow, on the Emperor’s\r\n      birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!”"

    "text": "Anna Pávlovna’s presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day during the\r\n      service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor’s birthday, Prince\r\n      Volkónski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from Prince\r\n      Kutúzov. It was Kutúzov’s report, written from Tatárinova on the day of\r\n      the battle. Kutúzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a step, that\r\n      the French losses were much heavier than ours, and that he was writing in\r\n      haste from the field of battle before collecting full information. It\r\n      followed that there must have been a victory. And at once, without leaving\r\n      the church, thanks were rendered to the Creator for His help and for the\r\n      victory.\nAnna Pávlovna’s presentiment was justified, and all that morning a\r\n      joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory\r\n      to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon’s having been\r\n      captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for France.\nIt is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and\r\n      completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of\r\n      action. General events involuntarily group themselves around some\r\n      particular incident. So now the courtiers’ pleasure was based as much on\r\n      the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperor’s birthday as on the\r\n      fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged surprise.\r\n      Mention was made in Kutúzov’s report of the Russian losses, among which\r\n      figured the names of Túchkov, Bagratión, and Kutáysov. In the Petersburg\r\n      world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a\r\n      single incident: Kutáysov’s death. Everybody knew him, the Emperor liked\r\n      him, and he was young and interesting. That day everyone met with the\r\n      words:\n“What a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss\r\n      Kutáysov is! How sorry I am!”\n“What did I tell about Kutúzov?” Prince Vasíli now said with a prophet’s\r\n      pride. “I always said he was the only man capable of defeating Napoleon.”\nBut next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew\r\n      anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense\r\n      occasioned the Emperor.\n“Fancy the Emperor’s position!” said they, and instead of extolling\r\n      Kutúzov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause\r\n      of the Emperor’s anxiety. That day Prince Vasíli no longer boasted of his\r\n      protégé Kutúzov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was\r\n      mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make\r\n      Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was added.\r\n      Countess Hélène Bezúkhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had\r\n      been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone\r\n      said that Countess Bezúkhova had died of a terrible attack of angina\r\n      pectoris, but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the\r\n      private physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a\r\n      certain drug to produce a certain effect; but Hélène, tortured by the fact\r\n      that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had\r\n      written (that wretched, profligate Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly\r\n      taken a very large dose of the drug, and had died in agony before\r\n      assistance could be rendered her. It was said that Prince Vasíli and the\r\n      old count had turned upon the Italian, but the latter had produced such\r\n      letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the\r\n      matter drop.\nTalk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor’s lack\r\n      of news, the loss of Kutáysov, and the death of Hélène.\nOn the third day after Kutúzov’s report a country gentleman arrived from\r\n      Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through\r\n      the whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor to be\r\n      in! Kutúzov was a traitor, and Prince Vasíli during the visits of\r\n      condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter’s death said of\r\n      Kutúzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his\r\n      grief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect\r\n      anything else from a blind and depraved old man.\n“I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such a\r\n      man.”\nAs long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it, but\r\n      the next day the following communication was received from Count\r\n      Rostopchín:\nPrince Kutúzov’s adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands\r\n      police officers to guide the army to the Ryazán road. He writes that he is\r\n      regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kutúzov’s action decides the fate of\r\n      the capital and of your empire! Russia will shudder to learn of the\r\n      abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which\r\n      lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall follow the army. I have had\r\n      everything removed, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my\r\n      fatherland.\nOn receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkónski to Kutúzov\r\n      with the following rescript:\nPrince Michael Ilariónovich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have\r\n      received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I\r\n      received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yaroslávl, the sad\r\n      news that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can\r\n      yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence\r\n      increases my astonishment. I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince\r\n      Volkónski, to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that\r\n      have induced you to take this melancholy decision."

    "text": "Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from Kutúzov\r\n      reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event. This\r\n      messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know Russian, but who wasquoique étranger, russe de cœur et d’âme,* as he said of himself.\n* Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.\nThe Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace on\r\n      Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before the campaign and\r\n      who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as he wrote) when he\r\n      appeared beforenotre très gracieux souverain* with the news of the\r\n      burning of Moscow,dont les flammes éclairaient sa route. *(2)\n* Our most gracious sovereign.\n* (2) Whose flames illumined his route.\nThough the source of M. Michaud’s chagrin must have been different from\r\n      that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when shown\r\n      into the Emperor’s study that the latter at once asked:\n“Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?”\n“Very sad, sire,” replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh. “The\r\n      abandonment of Moscow.”\n“Have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?” asked the\r\n      Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.\nMichaud respectfully delivered the message Kutúzov had entrusted to him,\r\n      which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that as\r\n      the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as Moscow,\r\n      or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the latter.\nThe Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.\n“Has the enemy entered the city?” he asked.\n“Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,” replied\r\n      Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he was frightened\r\n      by what he had done.\nThe Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip trembled,\r\n      and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.\nBut this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming himself\r\n      for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a firm voice:\n“I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires\r\n      great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in all things to His\r\n      will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the army when it saw my\r\n      ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did you not notice\r\n      discouragement?...”\nSeeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also grew\r\n      calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor’s direct and\r\n      relevant question which required a direct answer.\n“Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?” he\r\n      asked to gain time.\n“Colonel, I always require it,” replied the Emperor. “Conceal nothing from\r\n      me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.”\n“Sire!” said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on his\r\n      lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, “sire, I left the whole\r\n      army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in\r\n      desperate and agonized terror...”\n“How is that?” the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. “Would\r\n      misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!”\nMichaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared.\n“Sire,” he said, with respectful playfulness, “they are only afraid lest\r\n      Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be\r\n      persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the combat,” declared this\r\n      representative of the Russian nation, “and to prove to Your Majesty by the\r\n      sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are....”\n“Ah!” said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes, he\r\n      patted Michaud on the shoulder. “You set me at ease, Colonel.”\nHe bent his head and was silent for some time.\n“Well, then, go back to the army,” he said, drawing himself up to his full\r\n      height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture, “and\r\n      tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that when I\r\n      have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my beloved\r\n      nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of my empire.\r\n      It still offers me more than my enemies suppose,” said the Emperor growing\r\n      more and more animated; “but should it ever be ordained by Divine\r\n      Providence,” he continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with\r\n      emotion, “that my dynasty should cease to reign on the throne of my\r\n      ancestors, then after exhausting all the means at my command, I shall let\r\n      my beard grow to here” (he pointed halfway down his chest) “and go and eat\r\n      potatoes with the meanest of my peasants, rather than sign the disgrace of\r\n      my country and of my beloved people whose sacrifices I know how to\r\n      appreciate.”\nHaving uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly\r\n      turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,\r\n      and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few\r\n      moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow\r\n      with a vigorous movement. The Emperor’s mild and handsome face was flushed\r\n      and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.\n“Colonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may\r\n      recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I,” said the Emperor,\r\n      touching his breast. “We can no longer both reign together. I have learned\r\n      to know him, and he will not deceive me any more....”\nAnd the Emperor paused, with a frown.\nWhen he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in the\r\n      Emperor’s eyes, Michaud—quoique étranger, russe de cœur et\r\n      d’âme,—at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that\r\n      he had heard (as he used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his own\r\n      feelings and those of the Russian people whose representative he considered\r\n      himself to be, in the following words:\n“Sire!” said he, “Your Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the\r\n      nation and the salvation of Europe!”\nWith an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him."

    "text": "It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that\r\n      when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to\r\n      distant provinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the\r\n      defense of the fatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least\r\n      were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland, or\r\n      weeping over its downfall. The tales and descriptions of that time without\r\n      exception speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, despair,\r\n      grief, and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really so. It\r\n      appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that\r\n      time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had. Yet\r\n      in reality those personal interests of the moment so much transcend the\r\n      general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being\r\n      felt or even noticed. Most of the people at that time paid no attention to\r\n      the general progress of events but were guided only by their private\r\n      interests, and they were the very people whose activities at that period\r\n      were most useful.\nThose who tried to understand the general course of events and to take\r\n      part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of\r\n      society, they saw everything upside down, and all they did for the common\r\n      good turned out to be useless and foolish—like Pierre’s and\r\n      Mamónov’s regiments which looted Russian villages, and the lint the young\r\n      ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded, and so on. Even those,\r\n      fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings, who discussed\r\n      Russia’s position at the time involuntarily introduced into their\r\n      conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless\r\n      condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one\r\n      could possibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule forbidding us to\r\n      eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially applicable. Only\r\n      unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part in an historic\r\n      event never understands its significance. If he tries to realize it his\r\n      efforts are fruitless.\nThe more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in\r\n      Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and in\r\n      the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in militia\r\n      uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of\r\n      self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow\r\n      there was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight of\r\n      its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they\r\n      thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of Matrëshka the\r\n      vivandière, and like matters.\nAs the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rostóv took a close and\r\n      prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually, without\r\n      any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was going on in\r\n      Russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it.\r\n      Had he been asked what he thought of the state of Russia, he would have\r\n      said that it was not his business to think about it, that Kutúzov and\r\n      others were there for that purpose, but that he had heard that the\r\n      regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that fighting would\r\n      probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being so it was quite\r\n      likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years’ time.\nAs he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being sent\r\n      to Vorónezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without regret at\r\n      being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but with the\r\n      greatest pleasure—which he did not conceal and which his comrades\r\n      fully understood.\nA few days before the battle of Borodinó, Nicholas received the necessary\r\n      money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in advance, he set out\r\n      with post horses for Vorónezh.\nOnly a man who has experienced it—that is, has passed some months\r\n      continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war—can understand\r\n      the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the\r\n      army’s foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. When—free\r\n      from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp—he saw\r\n      villages with peasants and peasant women, gentlemen’s country houses,\r\n      fields where cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in\r\n      them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time. What for a\r\n      long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young and\r\n      healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women, too,\r\n      who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with\r\n      them.\nIn the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in Vorónezh,\r\n      ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and next day, very\r\n      clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long time,\r\n      went to present himself to the authorities.\nThe commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man who was\r\n      evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He received\r\n      Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military) and\r\n      questioned him with an important air, as if considering the general\r\n      progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do\r\n      so. Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him.\nFrom the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The governor\r\n      was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated the stud\r\n      farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a horse\r\n      dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the\r\n      best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.\n“You are Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son? My wife was a great friend of your\r\n      mother’s. We are at home on Thursdays—today is Thursday, so please\r\n      come and see us quite informally,” said the governor, taking leave of him.\nImmediately on leaving the governor’s, Nicholas hired post horses and,\r\n      taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the\r\n      landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to him\r\n      pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Vorónezh and, as\r\n      usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind, everything went\r\n      well and easily.\nThe landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a\r\n      horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy and\r\n      some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who owned\r\n      some splendid horses.\nIn very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six\r\n      thousand rubles—to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts.\r\n      After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine, Nicholas—having\r\n      exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was already on the\r\n      friendliest terms—galloped back over abominable roads, in the\r\n      brightest frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as to be in\r\n      time for the governor’s party.\nWhen he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself,\r\n      Nicholas arrived at the governor’s rather late, but with the phrase\r\n      “better late than never” on his lips.\nIt was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew that\r\n      Catherine Petróvna would play valses and theécossaiseon the clavichord\r\n      and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as to a ball.\nProvincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this\r\n      difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the\r\n      arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that\r\n      went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an\r\n      “in for a penny, in for a pound—who cares?” spirit, and the\r\n      inevitable small talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual\r\n      acquaintances, now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.\nThe society gathered together at the governor’s was the best in Vorónezh.\nThere were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas’ Moscow acquaintances,\r\n      but there were no men who could at all vie with the cavalier of St.\r\n      George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured and well-bred Count\r\n      Rostóv. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an officer of the French\r\n      army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that prisoner enhanced his\r\n      own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian was, as it were, a war\r\n      trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him that everyone regarded the\r\n      Italian in the same light, and he treated him cordially though with\r\n      dignity and restraint.\nAs soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him a\r\n      fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words “better late than\r\n      never” and heard them repeated several times by others, people clustered\r\n      around him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once that he had\r\n      entered into his proper position in the province—that of a universal\r\n      favorite: a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so after his long\r\n      privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in the landowner’s snuggery,\r\n      maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and here too at the\r\n      governor’s party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas) an inexhaustible\r\n      number of pretty young women, married and unmarried, impatiently awaiting\r\n      his notice. The women and girls flirted with him and, from the first day,\r\n      the people concerned themselves to get this fine young daredevil of an\r\n      hussar married and settled down. Among these was the governor’s wife\r\n      herself, who welcomed Rostóv as a near relative and called him “Nicholas.”\nCatherine Petróvna did actually play valses and theécossaise, and dancing\r\n      began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by\r\n      his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them\r\n      all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that\r\n      evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would even have\r\n      considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form, but\r\n      here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something\r\n      unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the\r\n      capital though new to them in the provinces.\nAll the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and pleasing\r\n      little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials. With the naïve\r\n      conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men’s wives were\r\n      created for them, Rostóv did not leave the lady’s side and treated her\r\n      husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if, without speaking of\r\n      it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady would get on together.\r\n      The husband, however, did not seem to share that conviction and tried to\r\n      behave morosely with Rostóv. But the latter’s good-natured naïveté was so\r\n      boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas’ good\r\n      humor. Toward the end of the evening, however, as the wife’s face grew\r\n      more flushed and animated, the husband’s became more and more melancholy\r\n      and solemn, as though there were but a given amount of animation between\r\n      them and as the wife’s share increased the husband’s diminished."

    "text": "Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely over\r\n      the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that\r\n      never left his face. Jauntily shifting the position of his legs in their\r\n      tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and admiring his\r\n      partner, himself, and the fine outlines of his legs in their well-fitting\r\n      Hessian boots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away\r\n      with a certain lady here in Vorónezh.\n“Which lady?”\n“A charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes” (Nicholas looked at his partner)\r\n      “are blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure” (he glanced at her\r\n      shoulders) “like Diana’s....”\nThe husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking\r\n      about.\n“Ah, Nikíta Iványch!” cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing\r\n      Nikíta Iványch to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention to\r\n      elope with a blonde lady.\nThe husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor’s good-natured\r\n      wife came up with a look of disapproval.\n“Anna Ignátyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,” said she, pronouncing the\r\n      name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna Ignátyevna was a very\r\n      important person. “Come, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?”\n“Oh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?”\n“Anna Ignátyevna Malvíntseva. She has heard from her niece how you rescued\r\n      her.... Can you guess?”\n“I rescued such a lot of them!” said Nicholas.\n“Her niece, Princess Bolkónskaya. She is here in Vorónezh with her aunt.\r\n      Oho! How you blush. Why, are...?”\n“Not a bit! Please don’t, Aunt!”\n“Very well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!”\nThe governor’s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a\r\n      blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most\r\n      important personages of the town. This was Malvíntseva, Princess Mary’s\r\n      aunt on her mother’s side, a rich, childless widow who always lived in\r\n      Vorónezh. When Rostóv approached her she was standing settling up for the\r\n      game. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued to\r\n      upbraid the general who had won from her.\n“Very pleased,mon cher,” she then said, holding out her\r\n      hand to Nicholas. “Pray come and see me.”\nAfter a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom\r\n      Malvíntseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas knew\r\n      of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the\r\n      important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to\r\n      come to see her.\nNicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention of\r\n      Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear, which\r\n      he himself did not understand.\nWhen he had parted from Malvíntseva Nicholas wished to return to the\r\n      dancing, but the governor’s little wife placed her plump hand on his\r\n      sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to her\r\n      sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as\r\n      not to be in her way.\n“Do you know, dear boy,” began the governor’s wife with a serious\r\n      expression on her kind little face, “that really would be the match for\r\n      you: would you like me to arrange it?”\n“Whom do you mean, Aunt?” asked Nicholas.\n“I will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petróvna speaks\r\n      of Lily, but I say, no—the princess! Do you want me to do it? I am\r\n      sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl she is,\r\n      really! And she is not at all so plain, either.”\n“Not at all,” replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. “As befits a\r\n      soldier, Aunt, I don’t force myself on anyone or refuse anything,” he said\r\n      before he had time to consider what he was saying.\n“Well then, remember, this is not a joke!”\n“Of course not!”\n“Yes, yes,” the governor’s wife said as if talking to herself. “But, my\r\n      dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the\r\n      blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....”\n“Oh no, we are good friends with him,” said Nicholas in the simplicity of\r\n      his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself\r\n      might not be pleasant to someone else.\n“But what nonsense I have been saying to the governor’s wife!” thought\r\n      Nicholas suddenly at supper. “She will really begin to arrange a match...\r\n      and Sónya...?” And on taking leave of the governor’s wife, when she again\r\n      smilingly said to him, “Well then, remember!” he drew her aside.\n“But see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...”\n“What is it, my dear? Come, let’s sit down here,” said she.\nNicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate\r\n      thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or his\r\n      friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwards\r\n      recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had\r\n      very important results for him, it seemed to him—as it seems to\r\n      everyone in such cases—that it was merely some silly whim that\r\n      seized him: yet that burst of frankness, together with other trifling\r\n      events, had immense consequences for him and for all his family.\n“You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the very\r\n      idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.”\n“Oh yes, I understand,” said the governor’s wife.\n“But Princess Bolkónskaya—that’s another matter. I will tell you the\r\n      truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; and\r\n      then, after I met her under such circumstances—so strangely, the\r\n      idea often occurred to me: ‘This is fate.’ Especially if you remember that\r\n      Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her\r\n      before, somehow it had always happened that we did not meet. And as long\r\n      as my sister Natásha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of\r\n      the question for me to think of marrying her. And it must needs happen\r\n      that I should meet her just when Natásha’s engagement had been broken\r\n      off... and then everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone\r\n      and never will, only to you.”\nThe governor’s wife pressed his elbow gratefully.\n“You know Sónya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her, and\r\n      will do so.... So you see there can be no question about—” said\r\n      Nicholas incoherently and blushing.\n“My dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know Sónya has nothing and you\r\n      yourself say your Papa’s affairs are in a very bad way. And what about\r\n      your mother? It would kill her, that’s one thing. And what sort of life\r\n      would it be for Sónya—if she’s a girl with a heart? Your mother in\r\n      despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and Sónya ought to\r\n      understand that.”\nNicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.\n“All the same, Aunt, it is impossible,” he rejoined with a sigh, after a\r\n      short pause. “Besides, would the princess have me? And besides, she is now\r\n      in mourning. How can one think of it!”\n“But you don’t suppose I’m going to get you married at once? There is\r\n      always a right way of doing things,” replied the governor’s wife.\n“What a matchmaker you are, Aunt...” said Nicholas, kissing her plump\r\n      little hand."

    "text": "On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostóv, Princess Mary had found\r\n      her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince Andrew giving\r\n      her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvíntseva at Vorónezh. That\r\n      feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her father’s\r\n      illness, since his death, and especially since her meeting with Rostóv was\r\n      smothered by arrangements for the journey, anxiety about her brother,\r\n      settling in a new house, meeting new people, and attending to her nephew’s\r\n      education. She was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet surroundings,\r\n      she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated\r\n      in her mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and incessantly\r\n      tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother, the only\r\n      intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was worried too\r\n      about her nephew’s education for which she had always felt herself\r\n      incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace—a peace\r\n      arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and\r\n      hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were related\r\n      to her meeting with Rostóv.\nThe day after her party the governor’s wife came to see Malvíntseva and,\r\n      after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though under\r\n      present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be thought\r\n      of, all the same the young people might be brought together and could get\r\n      to know one another. Malvíntseva expressed approval, and the governor’s\r\n      wife began to speak of Rostóv in Mary’s presence, praising him and telling\r\n      how he had blushed when Princess Mary’s name was mentioned. But Princess\r\n      Mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feeling—her mental\r\n      tranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts, self-reproach, and hopes\r\n      reawoke.\nDuring the two days that elapsed before Rostóv called, Princess Mary\r\n      continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she decided\r\n      not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt—that\r\n      it would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors;\r\n      then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then\r\n      it occurred to her that her aunt and the governor’s wife had intentions\r\n      concerning herself and Rostóv—their looks and words at times seemed\r\n      to confirm this supposition—then she told herself that only she,\r\n      with her sinful nature, could think this of them: they could not forget\r\n      that situated as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such\r\n      matchmaking would be an insult to her and to her father’s memory. Assuming\r\n      that she did go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would\r\n      say to her and what she would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed\r\n      undeservedly cold and then to mean too much. More than anything she feared\r\n      lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as\r\n      she saw him.\nBut when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing room\r\n      that Count Rostóv had called, the princess showed no confusion, only a\r\n      slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and\r\n      radiant light.\n“You have met him, Aunt?” said she in a calm voice, unable herself to\r\n      understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.\nWhen Rostóv entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an\r\n      instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then just\r\n      as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with\r\n      shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose with\r\n      a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him, and began\r\n      to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes\r\n      vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing room, looked at\r\n      Princess Mary in bewildered surprise. Herself a consummate coquette, she\r\n      could not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract.\n“Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly\r\n      improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what tact and\r\n      grace!” thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.\nHad Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would\r\n      have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that\r\n      had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized that dear,\r\n      loved face, a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to\r\n      speak and act apart from her own will. From the time Rostóv entered, her\r\n      face became suddenly transformed. It was as if a light had been kindled in\r\n      a carved and painted lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic work on\r\n      its sides, that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless, was\r\n      suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first time\r\n      all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had lived\r\n      appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction with\r\n      herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her meekness, love,\r\n      and self-sacrifice—all this now shone in those radiant eyes, in her\r\n      delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.\nRostóv saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He felt\r\n      that the being before him was quite different from, and better than,\r\n      anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.\nTheir conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the war,\r\n      and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it;\r\n      they spoke of their last meeting—Nicholas trying to change the\r\n      subject—they talked of the governor’s kind wife, of Nicholas’\r\n      relations, and of Princess Mary’s.\nShe did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon as\r\n      her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russia’s\r\n      misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near her\r\n      heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas\r\n      noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary’s character with\r\n      an observation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his conviction\r\n      that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and\r\n      was confused when people spoke to him about the princess (as she did when\r\n      he was mentioned) and even when he thought of her, but in her presence he\r\n      felt quite at ease, and said not at all what he had prepared, but what,\r\n      quite appropriately, occurred to him at the moment.\nWhen a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when\r\n      there are children, turned to Prince Andrew’s little son, caressing him\r\n      and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on his\r\n      knee, played with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a softened,\r\n      happy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she\r\n      loved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if understanding it,\r\n      flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured\r\n      playfulness.\nAs she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and\r\n      Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all the\r\n      same the governor’s wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to\r\n      Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice versa,\r\n      and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary. For this purpose\r\n      she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop’s house\r\n      before Mass.\nThough Rostóv told the governor’s wife that he would not make any\r\n      declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.\nAs at Tilsit Rostóv had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody\r\n      considered right was right, so now, after a short but sincere struggle\r\n      between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice, and in\r\n      obedient submission to circumstances, he chose the latter and yielded to\r\n      the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where. He knew\r\n      that after his promise to Sónya it would be what he deemed base to declare\r\n      his feelings to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never act basely.\r\n      But he also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart) that by\r\n      resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were\r\n      guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing something\r\n      very important—more important than anything he had ever done in his\r\n      life.\nAfter meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on\r\n      externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him\r\n      and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he had\r\n      thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in\r\n      society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously,\r\n      thought about Sónya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as almost\r\n      all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife, adapting her\r\n      in his imagination to all the conditions of married life: a white dressing\r\n      gown, his wife at the tea table, his wife’s carriage, little ones, Mamma\r\n      and Papa, their relations to her, and so on—and these pictures of\r\n      the future had given him pleasure. But with Princess Mary, to whom they\r\n      were trying to get him engaged, he could never picture anything of future\r\n      married life. If he tried, his pictures seemed incongruous and false. It\r\n      made him afraid."

    "text": "The dreadful news of the battle of Borodinó, of our losses in killed and\r\n      wounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached\r\n      Vorónezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having learned of her\r\n      brother’s wound only from theGazetteand having no definite news of\r\n      him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her again himself) to set off\r\n      in search of Prince Andrew.\nWhen he received the news of the battle of Borodinó and the abandonment of\r\n      Moscow, Rostóv was not seized with despair, anger, the desire for\r\n      vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but everything in Vorónezh\r\n      suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and he experienced an indefinite\r\n      feeling of shame and awkwardness. The conversations he heard seemed to him\r\n      insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that\r\n      only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him. He made\r\n      haste to finish buying the horses, and often became unreasonably angry\r\n      with his servant and squadron quartermaster.\nA few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which Nicholas\r\n      was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory. He stood a\r\n      little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through\r\n      the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects. When the service\r\n      was over the governor’s wife beckoned him to her.\n“Have you seen the princess?” she asked, indicating with a movement of her\r\n      head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond the choir.\nNicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile\r\n      he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, timidity, and\r\n      pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary, evidently engrossed by\r\n      her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the\r\n      church.\nNicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he had\r\n      seen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner,\r\n      spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There was a\r\n      pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had occurred\r\n      before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her without waiting to be\r\n      prompted by the governor’s wife and not asking himself whether or not it\r\n      was right and proper to address her here in church, and told her he had\r\n      heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as she\r\n      heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both her\r\n      sorrow and her joy.\n“There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,” said Rostóv. “It is\r\n      that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikoláevich, were not living, it would\r\n      have been at once announced in theGazette, as he is a colonel.”\nThe princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered\r\n      by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.\n“And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound” (theGazettesaid it\r\n      was a shell) “either proving fatal at once or being very slight,”\r\n       continued Nicholas. “We must hope for the best, and I am sure...”\nPrincess Mary interrupted him.\n“Oh, that would be so dread...” she began and, prevented by agitation from\r\n      finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she\r\n      did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully, went out, following\r\n      her aunt.\nThat evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some\r\n      accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that business it was\r\n      already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed, and for\r\n      a long time he paced up and down the room, reflecting on his life, a thing\r\n      he rarely did.\nPrincess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her\r\n      in Smolénsk province. His having encountered her in such exceptional\r\n      circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a\r\n      good match, had drawn his particular attention to her. When he met her\r\n      again in Vorónezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing\r\n      but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he\r\n      observed in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and it\r\n      had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of\r\n      chances of meeting her. But that day’s encounter in church had, he felt,\r\n      sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad,\r\n      refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and\r\n      especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features\r\n      agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rostóv could not bear to see\r\n      the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like\r\n      Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and\r\n      dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth\r\n      of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction.\n“She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!” he said to himself. “Why am\r\n      I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sónya?” And he involuntarily\r\n      compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of\r\n      it in the other—a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore\r\n      valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were he free.\r\n      How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife. But no, he\r\n      could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture presented\r\n      itself to his mind. He had long ago pictured to himself a future with\r\n      Sónya, and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been\r\n      thought out and he knew all there was in Sónya, but it was impossible to\r\n      picture a future with Princess Mary, because he did not understand her but\r\n      simply loved her.\nReveries about Sónya had had something merry and playful in them, but to\r\n      dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening.\n“How she prayed!” he thought. “It was plain that her whole soul was in her\r\n      prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am sure her\r\n      prayer will be answered. Why don’t I pray for what I want?” he suddenly\r\n      thought. “What do I want? To be free, released from Sónya... She was\r\n      right,” he thought, remembering what the governor’s wife had said:\r\n      “Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sónya. Muddles, grief for\r\n      Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles! Besides, I\r\n      don’t love her—not as I should. O, God! release me from this\r\n      dreadful, inextricable position!” he suddenly began to pray. “Yes, prayer\r\n      can move mountains, but one must have faith and not pray as Natásha and I\r\n      used to as children, that the snow might turn into sugar—and then\r\n      run out into the yard to see whether it had done so. No, but I am not\r\n      praying for trifles now,” he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner,\r\n      and folding his hands placed himself before the icon. Softened by memories\r\n      of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time.\r\n      Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and\r\n      Lavrúshka came in with some papers.\n“Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?” cried Nicholas,\r\n      quickly changing his attitude.\n“From the governor,” said Lavrúshka in a sleepy voice. “A courier has\r\n      arrived and there’s a letter for you.”\n“Well, all right, thanks. You can go!”\nNicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and the\r\n      other from Sónya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened Sónya’s\r\n      first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes\r\n      opened wide with fear and joy.\n“No, it’s not possible!” he cried aloud.\nUnable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and\r\n      reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again, and\r\n      standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders,\r\n      stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed.\r\n      What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear him\r\n      had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were\r\n      something extraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it\r\n      had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he\r\n      had prayed, but by some ordinary coincidence.\nThis unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter from\r\n      Sónya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had\r\n      seemed no escape. She wrote that the last unfortunate events—the\r\n      loss of almost the whole of the Rostóvs’ Moscow property—and the\r\n      countess’ repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry Princess\r\n      Bolkónskaya, together with his silence and coldness of late, had all\r\n      combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him\r\n      completely free.\nIt would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow\r\n      or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my\r\n      love has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I beg you\r\n      to consider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of everything,\r\n      no one can love you more than does\nYour Sónya\nBoth letters were written from Tróitsa. The other, from the countess,\r\n      described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and the\r\n      destruction of all their property. In this letter the countess also\r\n      mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them;\r\n      his state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more hope.\r\n      Sónya and Natásha were nursing him.\nNext day Nicholas took his mother’s letter and went to see Princess Mary.\r\n      Neither he nor she said a word about what “Natásha nursing him” might\r\n      mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as\r\n      intimate with the princess as if they were relations.\nThe following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to Yaroslávl,\r\n      and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment."

    "text": "Sónya’s letter written from Tróitsa, which had come as an answer to\r\n      Nicholas’ prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas\r\n      married to an heiress occupied the old countess’ mind more and more. She\r\n      knew that Sónya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and Sónya’s life\r\n      in the countess’ house had grown harder and harder, especially after they\r\n      had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess\r\n      Mary in Boguchárovo. The countess let no occasion slip of making\r\n      humiliating or cruel allusions to Sónya.\nBut a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that was\r\n      going on, she called Sónya to her and, instead of reproaching and making\r\n      demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all\r\n      that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with\r\n      Nicholas.\n“I shall not be at peace till you promise me this.”\nSónya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she\r\n      would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave no actual\r\n      promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of\r\n      her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought\r\n      her up. To sacrifice herself for others was Sónya’s habit. Her position in\r\n      the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth, and\r\n      she was accustomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her former acts\r\n      of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in\r\n      her own esteem and in that of others, and so made her more worthy of\r\n      Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world. But now they\r\n      wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward\r\n      for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life. And for the\r\n      first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors\r\n      only to torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous of Natásha who\r\n      had never experienced anything of this sort, had never needed to sacrifice\r\n      herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved\r\n      by everybody. And for the first time Sónya felt that out of her pure,\r\n      quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up\r\n      which was stronger than principle, virtue, or religion. Under the\r\n      influence of this feeling Sónya, whose life of dependence had taught her\r\n      involuntarily to be secretive, having answered the countess in vague\r\n      general terms, avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she\r\n      should see Nicholas, not in order to set him free but on the contrary at\r\n      that meeting to bind him to her forever.\nThe bustle and terror of the Rostóvs’ last days in Moscow stifled the\r\n      gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sónya. She was glad to find escape from\r\n      them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrew’s presence\r\n      in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for Natásha, she was\r\n      seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God did not intend her\r\n      to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that Natásha loved no one but\r\n      Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him. She knew that being thrown\r\n      together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in\r\n      love with one another, and that Nicholas would then not be able to marry\r\n      Princess Mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity.\r\n      Despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and\r\n      during the first days of their journey, this feeling that Providence was\r\n      intervening in her personal affairs cheered Sónya.\nAt the Tróitsa monastery the Rostóvs first broke their journey for a whole\r\n      day.\nThree large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, one of\r\n      which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much better that\r\n      day and Natásha was sitting with him. In the next room sat the count and\r\n      countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was calling on them\r\n      as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery. Sónya was there\r\n      too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and Natásha were\r\n      talking about. She heard the sound of their voices through the door. That\r\n      door opened and Natásha came out, looking excited. Not noticing the monk,\r\n      who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on his\r\n      right arm, she went up to Sónya and took her hand.\n“Natásha, what are you about? Come here!” said the countess.\nNatásha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray\r\n      for aid to God and His saint.\nAs soon as the prior withdrew, Natásha took her friend by the hand and\r\n      went with her into the unoccupied room.\n“Sónya, will he live?” she asked. “Sónya, how happy I am, and how\r\n      unhappy!... Sónya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he\r\n      lives! He cannot... because... because... of...” and Natásha burst into\r\n      tears.\n“Yes! I knew it! Thank God!” murmured Sónya. “He will live.”\nSónya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter’s fear and grief\r\n      and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one. Sobbing,\r\n      she kissed and comforted Natásha. “If only he lives!” she thought. Having\r\n      wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two friends went together to\r\n      Prince Andrew’s door. Natásha opened it cautiously and glanced into the\r\n      room, Sónya standing beside her at the half-open door.\nPrince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale face was\r\n      calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular breathing.\n“O, Natásha!” Sónya suddenly almost screamed, catching her companion’s arm\r\n      and stepping back from the door.\n“What? What is it?” asked Natásha.\n“It’s that, that...” said Sónya, with a white face and trembling lips.\nNatásha softly closed the door and went with Sónya to the window, not yet\r\n      understanding what the latter was telling her.\n“You remember,” said Sónya with a solemn and frightened expression. “You\r\n      remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at Otrádnoe at Christmas?\r\n      Do you remember what I saw?”\n“Yes, yes!” cried Natásha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely recalling\r\n      that Sónya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom she had seen\r\n      lying down.\n“You remember?” Sónya went on. “I saw it then and told everybody, you and\r\n      Dunyásha. I saw him lying on a bed,” said she, making a gesture with her\r\n      hand and a lifted finger at each detail, “and that he had his eyes closed\r\n      and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were folded,”\r\n       she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just seen were\r\n      exactly what she had seen in the mirror.\nShe had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that\r\n      came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now as\r\n      real as any other recollection. She not only remembered what she had then\r\n      said—that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with\r\n      something red—but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and\r\n      said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.\n“Yes, yes, it really was pink!” cried Natásha, who now thought she too\r\n      remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most\r\n      extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.\n“But what does it mean?” she added meditatively.\n“Oh, I don’t know, it is all so strange,” replied Sónya, clutching at her\r\n      head.\nA few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Natásha went to him, but Sónya,\r\n      feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the window thinking\r\n      about the strangeness of what had occurred.\n\nThey had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and the\r\n      countess was writing to her son.\n“Sónya!” said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as her niece\r\n      passed, “Sónya, won’t you write to Nicholas?” She spoke in a soft,\r\n      tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles\r\n      Sónya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words. Those\r\n      eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and\r\n      readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.\nSónya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.\n“Yes, Mamma, I will write,” said she.\nSónya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that\r\n      day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her\r\n      vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Natásha’s relations with\r\n      Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she was\r\n      joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in which\r\n      she was accustomed to live and loved to live. So with a joyful\r\n      consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed—interrupted several\r\n      times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes—she wrote that\r\n      touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas."

    "text": "The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with\r\n      hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was taken.\r\n      In their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to\r\n      who he might be—perhaps a very important person—and hostility\r\n      as a result of their recent personal conflict with him.\nBut when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the new\r\n      guard—both officers and men—he was not as interesting as he\r\n      had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not\r\n      recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who\r\n      had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered\r\n      those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only No. 17 of\r\n      the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason by order of\r\n      the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it\r\n      was only his unabashed, meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and\r\n      the way he spoke French, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite\r\n      of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the\r\n      separate room he had occupied was required by an officer.\nAll the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and,\r\n      recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as\r\n      he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.\nThat evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among\r\n      them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken\r\n      with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache\r\n      sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms. With\r\n      the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners, and\r\n      which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others was\r\n      questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object, and so\r\n      on.\nThese questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the essence\r\n      of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that essence’s being\r\n      revealed, and were designed only to form a channel through which the\r\n      judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the\r\n      desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say\r\n      anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and\r\n      the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused\r\n      always feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were put\r\n      to him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a kind\r\n      of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. He knew he\r\n      was in these men’s power, that only by force had they brought him there,\r\n      that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions,\r\n      and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him. And so, as\r\n      they had the power and wish to inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry\r\n      and trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident that any answer would lead to\r\n      conviction. When asked what he was doing when he was arrested, Pierre\r\n      replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a\r\n      child he had saved from the flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre\r\n      answered that he “was protecting a woman,” and that “to protect a woman\r\n      who was being insulted was the duty of every man; that...” They\r\n      interrupted him, for this was not to the point. Why was he in the yard of\r\n      a burning house where witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone\r\n      out to see what was happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they\r\n      had not asked where he was going, but why he was found near the fire? Who\r\n      was he? they asked, repeating their first question, which he had declined\r\n      to answer. Again he replied that he could not answer it.\n“Put that down, that’s bad... very bad,” sternly remarked the general with\r\n      the white mustache and red flushed face.\n\nOn the fourth day fires broke out on the Zúbovski rampart.\nPierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant’s\r\n      house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the streets Pierre felt\r\n      stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city. Fires were\r\n      visible on all sides. He did not then realize the significance of the\r\n      burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires with horror.\nHe passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and during\r\n      that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that all those\r\n      confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the\r\n      marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn from the soldiers.\r\n      Evidently for them “the marshal” represented a very high and rather\r\n      mysterious power.\nThese first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were\r\n      had up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre."

    "text": "On the eighth of September an officer—a very important one judging\r\n      by the respect the guards showed him—entered the coach house where\r\n      the prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was\r\n      holding a paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there,\r\n      naming Pierre as “the man who does not give his name.” Glancing indolently\r\n      and indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge\r\n      to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the\r\n      marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with\r\n      thirteen others was led to the Virgin’s Field. It was a fine day, sunny\r\n      after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low as\r\n      on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the Zúbovski\r\n      rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns. No flames were seen,\r\n      but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre\r\n      could see was one vast charred ruin. On all sides there were waste spaces\r\n      with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and here and there the\r\n      blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed at the ruins and did\r\n      not recognize districts he had known well. Here and there he could see\r\n      churches that had not been burned. The Krémlin, which was not destroyed,\r\n      gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of Iván the\r\n      Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin glittered brightly and\r\n      its bells were ringing particularly clearly. These bells reminded Pierre\r\n      that it was Sunday and the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin. But there\r\n      seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday: everywhere were blackened\r\n      ruins, and the few Russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people\r\n      who tried to hide when they saw the French.\nIt was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in place\r\n      of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre unconsciously\r\n      felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been established over\r\n      this ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of the soldiers who, marching\r\n      in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were escorting him and the other\r\n      criminals; he felt it in the looks of an important French official in a\r\n      carriage and pair driven by a soldier, whom they met on the way. He felt\r\n      it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of\r\n      the field, and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners\r\n      the French officer had read out when he came that morning. Pierre had been\r\n      taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another\r\n      place with dozens of other men, and it seemed that they might have\r\n      forgotten him, or confused him with the others. But no: the answers he had\r\n      given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as “the man\r\n      who does not give his name,” and under that appellation, which to Pierre\r\n      seemed terrible, they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating\r\n      assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly\r\n      the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place.\r\n      Pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of\r\n      a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well.\nHe and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin’s\r\n      Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the\r\n      convent. This was Prince Shcherbátov’s house, where Pierre had often been\r\n      in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the soldiers, was\r\n      now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of Eckmühl (Davout).\nThey were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one. Pierre\r\n      was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery, an\r\n      anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low study at\r\n      the door of which stood an adjutant.\nDavout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of\r\n      the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting a\r\n      paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes, he\r\n      said in a low voice:\n“Who are you?”\nPierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him\r\n      Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for his\r\n      cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who\r\n      was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every instant\r\n      of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what to say. He did\r\n      not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination, yet to\r\n      disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing. So he was\r\n      silent. But before he had decided what to do, Davout raised his head,\r\n      pushed his spectacles back on his forehead, screwed up his eyes, and\r\n      looked intently at him.\n“I know that man,” he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently calculated\r\n      to frighten Pierre.\nThe chill that had been running down Pierre’s back now seized his head as\r\n      in a vise.\n“You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...”\n“He is a Russian spy,” Davout interrupted, addressing another general who\r\n      was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.\nDavout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre\r\n      rapidly began:\n“No, monseigneur,” he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke.\r\n      “No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia officer and\r\n      have not quitted Moscow.”\n“Your name?” asked Davout.\n“Bezúkhov.”\n“What proof have I that you are not lying?”\n“Monseigneur!” exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading\r\n      voice.\nDavout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked\r\n      at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war\r\n      and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At\r\n      that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their\r\n      minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were\r\n      brothers.\nAt the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the papers\r\n      where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre was merely\r\n      a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without burdening his\r\n      conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a human being. He\r\n      reflected for a moment.\n“How can you show me that you are telling the truth?” said Davout coldly.\nPierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the street\r\n      where the house was.\n“You are not what you say,” returned Davout.\nIn a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the truth\r\n      of his statements.\nBut at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout.\nDavout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began buttoning\r\n      up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.\nWhen the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in\r\n      Pierre’s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But where\r\n      they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house or to\r\n      the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they\r\n      crossed the Virgin’s Field.\nHe turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question\r\n      to Davout.\n“Yes, of course!” replied Davout, but what this “yes” meant, Pierre did\r\n      not know.\nPierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or\r\n      in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied, and\r\n      noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till\r\n      they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his mind at that\r\n      time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to death? Not the men\r\n      on the commission that had first examined him—not one of them wished\r\n      to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout, who had looked at\r\n      him in so human a way. In another moment Davout would have realized that\r\n      he was doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted\r\n      him. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil intent though he might\r\n      have refrained from coming in. Then who was executing him, killing him,\r\n      depriving him of life—him, Pierre, with all his memories,\r\n      aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre felt that\r\n      it was no one.\nIt was a system—a concurrence of circumstances.\nA system of some sort was killing him—Pierre—depriving him of\r\n      life, of everything, annihilating him."

    "text": "From Prince Shcherbátov’s house the prisoners were led straight down the\r\n      Virgin’s Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden in\r\n      which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in\r\n      the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a\r\n      semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many of Napoleon’s\r\n      soldiers who were not on duty—Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, in a\r\n      variety of uniforms. To the right and left of the post stood rows of\r\n      French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and\r\n      shakos.\nThe prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list\r\n      (Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly began\r\n      to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as if part of\r\n      his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of thinking or\r\n      understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only one wish—that\r\n      the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre\r\n      looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.\nThe two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin, the\r\n      other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was a domestic\r\n      serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a plump,\r\n      well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome man with a\r\n      broad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a factory hand, a\r\n      thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat.\nPierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or two\r\n      at a time. “In couples,” replied the officer in command in a calm voice.\r\n      There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they\r\n      were all hurrying—not as men hurry to do something they understand,\r\n      but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and\r\n      incomprehensible task.\nA French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of\r\n      prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.\nThen two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the officer’s\r\n      command took the two convicts who stood first in the row. The convicts\r\n      stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being brought,\r\n      looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman.\r\n      One crossed himself continually, the other scratched his back and made a\r\n      movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands the soldiers\r\n      blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and bound them to\r\n      the post.\nTwelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm\r\n      regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned away to\r\n      avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling noise\r\n      was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder, and\r\n      he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen were doing\r\n      something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands. Two more\r\n      prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks, these two\r\n      glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection\r\n      in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to\r\n      happen to them. They could not believe it because they alone knew what\r\n      their life meant to them, and so they neither understood nor believed that\r\n      it could be taken from them.\nAgain Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again the\r\n      sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the same moment\r\n      he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who were\r\n      again doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding one\r\n      another. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what it\r\n      meant. The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.\nOn the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and officers\r\n      without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict that were\r\n      in his own heart. “But who, after all, is doing this? They are all\r\n      suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?” flashed for an instant through\r\n      his mind.\n“Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!” shouted someone. The fifth prisoner,\r\n      the one next to Pierre, was led away—alone. Pierre did not\r\n      understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought there\r\n      only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror, and no sense of\r\n      joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place. The fifth man was the\r\n      factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid hands on him he\r\n      sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook\r\n      himself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him along, holding\r\n      him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got him to the post he\r\n      grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something. Whether he understood\r\n      that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men\r\n      should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at the post, waiting to be\r\n      blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded animal looked around him\r\n      with glittering eyes.\nPierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity\r\n      and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch at\r\n      this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he wrapped\r\n      his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.\nWhen they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt\r\n      the back of his head; then when they propped him against the bloodstained\r\n      post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that position,\r\n      straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again more\r\n      comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his\r\n      slightest movement.\nProbably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of\r\n      eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember\r\n      having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the workman\r\n      suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood showed itself in\r\n      two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body,\r\n      and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally and one leg\r\n      bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered him. Pale,\r\n      frightened people were doing something around the workman. The lower jaw\r\n      of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes.\r\n      The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and\r\n      began pushing it into the pit.\nThey all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide\r\n      the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.\nPierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with\r\n      his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other.\r\n      That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls\r\n      of earth were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the\r\n      soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to go\r\n      back. But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post, and no\r\n      one drove him away.\nWhen the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was taken back\r\n      to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half\r\n      turn and went past it at a measured pace. The twenty-four sharpshooters\r\n      with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the circle, ran back to\r\n      their places as the companies passed by.\nPierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples\r\n      out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. This one, a young\r\n      soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and his musket\r\n      resting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the spot from which he\r\n      had fired. He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps forward and\r\n      back to save himself from falling. An old, noncommissioned officer ran out\r\n      of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company. The\r\n      crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse. They all went away\r\n      silently and with drooping heads.\n“That will teach them to start fires,” said one of the Frenchmen.\nPierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was\r\n      trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was not able to\r\n      do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless\r\n      movement with his arm and went away."

    "text": "After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners\r\n      and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.\nToward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and\r\n      told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for\r\n      the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him, Pierre\r\n      got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of the\r\n      field, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams, and\r\n      battens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty\r\n      different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding\r\n      who they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He heard\r\n      what they said, but did not understand the meaning of the words and made\r\n      no kind of deduction from or application of them. He replied to questions\r\n      they put to him, but did not consider who was listening to his replies,\r\n      nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces and figures,\r\n      but they all seemed to him equally meaningless.\nFrom the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by\r\n      men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspring of his\r\n      life, on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive,\r\n      had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of\r\n      meaningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowledge it to himself, his\r\n      faith in the right ordering of the universe, in humanity, in his own soul,\r\n      and in God, had been destroyed. He had experienced this before, but never\r\n      so strongly as now. When similar doubts had assailed him before, they had\r\n      been the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he\r\n      had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be\r\n      found within himself. But now he felt that the universe had crumbled\r\n      before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained, and this not by any\r\n      fault of his own. He felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in\r\n      the meaning of life.\nAround him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about\r\n      him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and asking\r\n      him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he found\r\n      himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and talking on\r\n      all sides.\n“Well, then, mates... that very princewho...” some voice at\r\n      the other end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the wordwho.\nSitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall, Pierre\r\n      sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as he closed\r\n      them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory lad—especially\r\n      dreadful because of its simplicity—and the faces of the murderers,\r\n      even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened his eyes again\r\n      and stared vacantly into the darkness around him.\nBeside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he was\r\n      first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from him\r\n      every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the\r\n      darkness, and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man\r\n      continually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw\r\n      that the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused\r\n      Pierre’s interest.\nHaving unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully\r\n      coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up at\r\n      Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already\r\n      unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully\r\n      removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one\r\n      another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed\r\n      above his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed the knife,\r\n      placed it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself comfortably,\r\n      clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on Pierre. The\r\n      latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting, and well-rounded\r\n      in these deft movements, in the man’s well-ordered arrangements in his\r\n      corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at the man without\r\n      taking his eyes from him.\n“You’ve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?” the little man suddenly said.\nAnd there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that\r\n      Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to\r\n      his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray his\r\n      confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant tones:\n“Eh, lad, don’t fret!” said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice old\r\n      Russian peasant women employ. “Don’t fret, friend—‘suffer an hour,\r\n      live for an age!’ that’s how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live,\r\n      thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are good men\r\n      as well as bad,” said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees with\r\n      a supple movement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of the\r\n      shed.\n“Eh, you rascal!” Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end\r\n      of the shed. “So you’ve come, you rascal? She remembers... Now, now,\r\n      that’ll do!”\nAnd the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him,\r\n      returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something wrapped\r\n      in a rag.\n“Here, eat a bit, sir,” said he, resuming his former respectful tone as he\r\n      unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. “We had soup for dinner\r\n      and the potatoes are grand!”\nPierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed\r\n      extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.\n“Well, are they all right?” said the soldier with a smile. “You should do\r\n      like this.”\nHe took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two equal\r\n      halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the rag,\r\n      and handed it to Pierre.\n“The potatoes are grand!” he said once more. “Eat some like that!”\nPierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.\n“Oh, I’m all right,” said he, “but why did they shoot those poor fellows?\r\n      The last one was hardly twenty.”\n“Tss, tt...!” said the little man. “Ah, what a sin... what a sin!” he\r\n      added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth\r\n      and flew out involuntarily he went on: “How was it, sir, that you stayed\r\n      in Moscow?”\n“I didn’t think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,” replied\r\n      Pierre.\n“And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?”\n“No, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried me\r\n      as an incendiary.”\n“Where there’s law there’s injustice,” put in the little man.\n“And have you been here long?” Pierre asked as he munched the last of the\r\n      potato.\n“I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.”\n“Why, are you a soldier then?”\n“Yes, we are soldiers of the Ápsheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We\r\n      weren’t told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had no\r\n      idea, never guessed at all.”\n“And do you feel sad here?” Pierre inquired.\n“How can one help it, lad? My name is Platón, and the surname is\r\n      Karatáev,” he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to\r\n      address him. “They call me ‘little falcon’ in the regiment. How is one to\r\n      help feeling sad? Moscow—she’s the mother of cities. How can one see\r\n      all this and not feel sad? But ‘the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies\r\n      first’; that’s what the old folks used to tell us,” he added rapidly.\n“What? What did you say?” asked Pierre.\n“Who? I?” said Karatáev. “I say things happen not as we plan but as God\r\n      judges,” he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said\r\n      before, and immediately continued:\n“Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have\r\n      abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still\r\n      living?” he asked.\nAnd though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed\r\n      smile of kindliness puckered the soldier’s lips as he put these questions.\r\n      He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that he had no\r\n      mother.\n“A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there’s none as dear\r\n      as one’s own mother!” said he. “Well, and have you little ones?” he went\r\n      on asking.\nAgain Pierre’s negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened to\r\n      add:\n“Never mind! You’re young folks yet, and please God may still have some.\r\n      The great thing is to live in harmony....”\n“But it’s all the same now,” Pierre could not help saying.\n“Ah, my dear fellow!” rejoined Karatáev, “never decline a prison or a\r\n      beggar’s sack!”\nHe seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently preparing to\r\n      tell a long story.\n“Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,” he began. “We had a\r\n      well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and our house\r\n      was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing there were\r\n      seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so happened...”\nAnd Platón Karatáev told a long story of how he had gone into someone’s\r\n      copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, had been tried,\r\n      flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.\n“Well, lad,” and a smile changed the tone of his voice, “we thought it was\r\n      a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for my sin,\r\n      my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger brother,\r\n      had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife behind. We had a\r\n      little girl, but God took her before I went as a soldier. I come home on\r\n      leave and I’ll tell you how it was, I look and see that they are living\r\n      better than before. The yard full of cattle, the women at home, two\r\n      brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the youngest, at home.\r\n      Father, he says, ‘All my children are the same to me: it hurts the same\r\n      whichever finger gets bitten. But if Platón hadn’t been shaved for a\r\n      soldier, Michael would have had to go.’ called us all to him and, will you\r\n      believe it, placed us in front of the icons. ‘Michael,’ he says, ‘come\r\n      here and bow down to his feet; and you, young woman, you bow down too; and\r\n      you, grandchildren, also bow down before him! Do you understand?’ he says.\r\n      That’s how it is, dear fellow. Fate looks for a head. But we are always\r\n      judging, ‘that’s not well—that’s not right!’ Our luck is like water\r\n      in a dragnet: you pull at it and it bulges, but when you’ve drawn it out\r\n      it’s empty! That’s how it is.”\nAnd Platón shifted his seat on the straw.\nAfter a short silence he rose.\n“Well, I think you must be sleepy,” said he, and began rapidly crossing\r\n      himself and repeating:\n“Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus\r\n      Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, have\r\n      mercy on us and save us!” he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got up,\r\n      sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. “That’s the way. Lay me\r\n      down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,” he muttered as he\r\n      lay down, pulling his coat over him.\n“What prayer was that you were saying?” asked Pierre.\n“Eh?” murmured Platón, who had almost fallen asleep. “What was I saying? I\r\n      was praying. Don’t you pray?”\n“Yes, I do,” said Pierre. “But what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?”\n“Well, of course,” replied Platón quickly, “the horses’ saints. One must\r\n      pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you’ve curled up and got warm,\r\n      you daughter of a bitch!” said Karatáev, touching the dog that lay at his\r\n      feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.\nSounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance\r\n      outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but\r\n      inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but\r\n      lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular snoring of\r\n      Platón who lay beside him, and he felt that the world that had been\r\n      shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on new\r\n      and unshakable foundations."

    "text": "Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined in\r\n      the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for four\r\n      weeks.\nWhen Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to\r\n      him except Platón Karatáev, who always remained in his mind a most vivid\r\n      and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian, kindly,\r\n      and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the first\r\n      impression of him, as of something round, was fully confirmed: Platón’s\r\n      whole figure—in a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a soldier’s\r\n      cap, and bast shoes—was round. His head was quite round, his back,\r\n      chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever ready to\r\n      embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his large, gentle\r\n      brown eyes were also round.\nPlatón Karatáev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of campaigns\r\n      he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not himself know his age\r\n      and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly white, strong\r\n      teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed—as he\r\n      often did—were all sound and good, there was not a gray hair in his\r\n      beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness\r\n      and especially of firmness and endurance.\nHis face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of\r\n      innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief\r\n      peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was\r\n      evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say, and\r\n      consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an\r\n      irresistible persuasiveness.\nHis physical strength and agility during the first days of his\r\n      imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and\r\n      sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: “Lord, lay me down\r\n      as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!” and every morning on getting up, he\r\n      said: “I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself.” And indeed he\r\n      only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he only had to\r\n      shake himself, to be ready without a moment’s delay for some work, just as\r\n      children are ready to play directly they awake. He could do everything,\r\n      not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended\r\n      boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed himself conversation—of\r\n      which he was fond—and songs. He did not sing like a trained singer\r\n      who knows he is listened to, but like the birds, evidently giving vent to\r\n      the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks about to\r\n      get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were always high-pitched, mournful,\r\n      delicate, and almost feminine, and his face at such times was very\r\n      serious.\nHaving been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to\r\n      have thrown off all that had been forced upon him—everything\r\n      military and alien to himself—and had returned to his former peasant\r\n      habits.\n“A soldier on leave—a shirt outside breeches,” he would say.\nHe did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not\r\n      complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the\r\n      whole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally some\r\n      old and evidently precious memory of his “Christian” life, as he called\r\n      his peasant existence. The proverbs, of which his talk was full, were for\r\n      the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ, but those\r\n      folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant, but when\r\n      used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom.\nHe would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous\r\n      occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he talked well,\r\n      adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which\r\n      Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his talk lay in\r\n      the fact that the commonest events—sometimes just such as Pierre had\r\n      witnessed without taking notice of them—assumed in Karatáev’s a\r\n      character of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the\r\n      soldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same), but most\r\n      of all he liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile joyfully when\r\n      listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word or asking a\r\n      question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself.\r\n      Karatáev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre understood\r\n      them, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him\r\n      in contact with, particularly with man—not any particular man, but\r\n      those with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the\r\n      French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt that in spite of\r\n      Karatáev’s affectionate tenderness for him (by which he unconsciously gave\r\n      Pierre’s spiritual life its due) he would not have grieved for a moment at\r\n      parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in the same way toward\r\n      Karatáev.\nTo all the other prisoners Platón Karatáev seemed a most ordinary soldier.\r\n      They called him “little falcon” or “Platósha,” chaffed\r\n      him good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always remained\r\n      what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded, eternal\r\n      personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.\nPlatón Karatáev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he began to\r\n      speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.\nSometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask him to\r\n      repeat them, but Platón could never recall what he had said a moment\r\n      before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of his favorite\r\n      song:nativeandbirch treeandmy heart is sickoccurred in\r\n      it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of it. He did not,\r\n      and could not, understand the meaning of words apart from their context. Every\r\n      word and action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to\r\n      him, which was his life. But his life, as he regarded it, had no meaning\r\n      as a separate thing. It had meaning only as part of a whole of which he\r\n      was always conscious. His words and actions flowed from him as evenly,\r\n      inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower. He could\r\n      not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken\r\n      separately."

    "text": "When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the\r\n      Rostóvs at Yaroslávl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her\r\n      aunt’s efforts to dissuade her—and not merely to go herself but to\r\n      take her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, possible or\r\n      impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it was her duty, not\r\n      only to herself, to be near her brother who was perhaps dying, but to do\r\n      everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared to set\r\n      off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess Mary\r\n      attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long\r\n      journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.\nIn a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were the\r\n      huge family coach in which she had traveled to Vorónezh, a semiopen trap,\r\n      and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne, little\r\n      Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, Tíkhon, and a young\r\n      footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.\nThe usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the roundabout\r\n      way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lípetsk, Ryazán, Vladímir,\r\n      and Shúya was very long and, as post horses were not everywhere\r\n      obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryazán where the French were said to\r\n      have shown themselves was even dangerous.\nDuring this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and\r\n      Princess Mary’s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of\r\n      spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and no\r\n      difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which\r\n      infected her fellow travelers, they approached Yaroslávl by the end of the\r\n      second week.\nThe last days of her stay in Vorónezh had been the happiest of her life.\r\n      Her love for Rostóv no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her\r\n      whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer\r\n      struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that she loved and\r\n      was beloved, though she never said this definitely to herself in words.\r\n      She had become convinced of it at her last interview with Nicholas, when\r\n      he had come to tell her that her brother was with the Rostóvs. Not by a\r\n      single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that Prince Andrew’s\r\n      relations with Natásha might, if he recovered, be renewed, but Princess\r\n      Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this.\nYet in spite of that, his relation to her—considerate, delicate, and\r\n      loving—not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to\r\n      Princess Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between\r\n      them allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew that she\r\n      loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was\r\n      beloved, and was happy in regard to it.\nBut this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her\r\n      feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that\r\n      spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to\r\n      give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so strong\r\n      at the moment of leaving Vorónezh that those who saw her off, as they\r\n      looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on\r\n      the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey,\r\n      which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief\r\n      and gave her strength.\nAs always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the\r\n      journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached Yaroslávl the\r\n      thought of what might await her there—not after many days, but that\r\n      very evening—again presented itself to her and her agitation\r\n      increased to its utmost limit.\nThe courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the Rostóvs\r\n      were staying in Yaroslávl, and in what condition Prince Andrew was, when\r\n      he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled by the\r\n      terrible pallor of the princess’ face that looked out at him from the\r\n      window.\n“I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostóvs are staying at\r\n      the merchant Brónnikov’s house, in the Square not far from here, right\r\n      above the Vólga,” said the courier.\nPrincess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding why\r\n      he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her brother?\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.\n“How is the prince?” she asked.\n“His excellency is staying in the same house with them.”\n“Then he is alive,” thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice: “How\r\n      is he?”\n“The servants say he is still the same.”\nWhat “still the same” might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an\r\n      unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in\r\n      front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head and did\r\n      not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and swaying,\r\n      came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as they were let down.\nThe carriage door was opened. On the left there was water—a great\r\n      river—and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:\r\n      servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as it\r\n      seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This was Sónya.)\r\n      Princess Mary ran up the steps. “This way, this way!” said the girl, with\r\n      the same artificial smile, and the princess found herself in the hall\r\n      facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to meet her\r\n      with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She embraced Princess Mary\r\n      and kissed her.\n“Mon enfant!”she muttered,“je vous aime et vous\r\n      connais depuis longtemps.”*\n* “My child! I love you and have known you a long time.”\nDespite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the\r\n      countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly\r\n      knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in\r\n      French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and\r\n      asked: “How is he?”\n“The doctor says that he is not in danger,” said the countess, but as she\r\n      spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a\r\n      contradiction of her words.\n“Where is he? Can I see him—can I?” asked the princess.\n“One moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?” said the\r\n      countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles.\r\n      “There will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh, what a lovely\r\n      boy!”\nThe countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where Sónya was\r\n      talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the boy, and the\r\n      old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had changed very much\r\n      since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had been a brisk, cheerful,\r\n      self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered person. While\r\n      talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone\r\n      whether he was doing the right thing. After the destruction of Moscow and\r\n      of his property, thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have\r\n      lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no\r\n      longer a place for him in life.\nIn spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, and her\r\n      vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should\r\n      be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew, the\r\n      princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity\r\n      of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things which she had\r\n      entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it was hard for her she\r\n      was not vexed with these people.\n“This is my niece,” said the count, introducing Sónya—“You don’t\r\n      know her, Princess?”\nPrincess Mary turned to Sónya and, trying to stifle the hostile feeling\r\n      that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt oppressed\r\n      by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was\r\n      in her own heart.\n“Where is he?” she asked again, addressing them all.\n“He is downstairs. Natásha is with him,” answered Sónya, flushing. “We\r\n      have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.”\nTears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary’s eyes. She turned\r\n      away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when light,\r\n      impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door. The\r\n      princess looked round and saw Natásha coming in, almost running—that\r\n      Natásha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow long\r\n      since.\nBut hardly had the princess looked at Natásha’s face before she realized\r\n      that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a friend. She\r\n      ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her shoulder.\nAs soon as Natásha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew’s bed, heard of\r\n      Princess Mary’s arrival, she softly left his room and hastened to her with\r\n      those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary.\nThere was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the\r\n      drawing room—that of love—boundless love for him, for her, and\r\n      for all that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for\r\n      others, and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them. It\r\n      was plain that at that moment there was in Natásha’s heart no thought of\r\n      herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.\nPrincess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the\r\n      first glance at Natásha’s face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful\r\n      pleasure.\n“Come, come to him, Mary,” said Natásha, leading her into the other room.\nPrincess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to Natásha. She\r\n      felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn everything.\n“How...” she began her question but stopped short.\nShe felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words. Natásha’s\r\n      face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly.\nNatásha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say\r\n      all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes\r\n      which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible not\r\n      to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, Natásha’s lips\r\n      twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face\r\n      with her hands she burst into sobs.\nPrincess Mary understood.\nBut she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:\n“But how is his wound? What is his general condition?”\n“You, you... will see,” was all Natásha could say.\nThey sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off\r\n      crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.\n“How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When did\r\n      this happen?” Princess Mary inquired.\nNatásha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish\r\n      condition and the pain he suffered, but at Tróitsa that had passed and the\r\n      doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also passed. When\r\n      they reached Yaroslávl the wound had begun to fester (Natásha knew all\r\n      about such things as festering) and the doctor had said that the festering\r\n      might take a normal course. Then fever set in, but the doctor had said the\r\n      fever was not very serious.\n“But two days agothissuddenly happened,” said Natásha, struggling with\r\n      her sobs. “I don’t know why, but you will see what he is like.”\n“Is he weaker? Thinner?” asked the princess.\n“No, it’s not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too good, he\r\n      cannot, cannot live, because...”"

    "text": "When Natásha opened Prince Andrew’s door with a familiar movement and let\r\n      Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the sobs in\r\n      her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now tried to\r\n      remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at him without\r\n      tears.\nThe princess understood what Natásha had meant by the words: “two days agothissuddenly happened.” She understood those words to mean that he had\r\n      suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of\r\n      approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in\r\n      imagination Andrew’s face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,\r\n      mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore\r\n      affected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender words\r\n      to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and that she would\r\n      not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence. Yet\r\n      sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. The sobs rose higher and\r\n      higher in her throat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form\r\n      and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features, and then she saw\r\n      his face and met his gaze.\nHe was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by\r\n      pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand he\r\n      held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache\r\n      he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them as they\r\n      entered.\nOn seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary’s pace suddenly\r\n      slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She suddenly\r\n      felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and\r\n      eyes.\n“But in what am I to blame?” she asked herself. And his cold, stern look\r\n      replied: “Because you are alive and thinking of the living, while I...”\nIn the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an\r\n      almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and Natásha.\nHe kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.\n“How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?” said he in a voice as\r\n      calm and aloof as his look.\nHad he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror\r\n      into Princess Mary’s heart as the tone of his voice.\n“And have you brought little Nicholas?” he asked in the same slow, quiet\r\n      manner and with an obvious effort to remember.\n“How are you now?” said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she was\r\n      saying.\n“That, my dear, you must ask the doctor,” he replied, and again making an\r\n      evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips only (his words\r\n      clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):\n“Merci, chère amie, d’être venue.”*\n* “Thank you for coming, my dear.”\nPrincess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just\r\n      perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now\r\n      understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words, his\r\n      tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could be felt\r\n      an estrangement from everything belonging to this world, terrible in one\r\n      who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he understand anything\r\n      living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand, not because he\r\n      lacked the power to do so but because he understood something else—something\r\n      the living did not and could not understand—and which wholly\r\n      occupied his mind.\n“There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,” said he,\r\n      breaking the silence and pointing to Natásha. “She looks after me all the\r\n      time.”\nPrincess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a\r\n      thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,\r\n      before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he\r\n      could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had\r\n      not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her and how\r\n      could he speak like that in her presence? The only explanation was that he\r\n      was indifferent, because something else, much more important, had been\r\n      revealed to him.\nThe conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off.\n“Mary came by way of Ryazán,” said Natásha.\nPrince Andrew did not notice that she called his sisterMary, and only\r\n      after calling her so in his presence did Natásha notice it herself.\n“Really?” he asked.\n“They told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that...”\nNatásha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was\r\n      making an effort to listen, but could not do so.\n“Yes, they say it’s burned,” he said. “It’s a great pity,” and he gazed\r\n      straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers.\n“And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?” Prince Andrew suddenly said,\r\n      evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. “He wrote here that he took\r\n      a great liking to you,” he went on simply and calmly, evidently unable to\r\n      understand all the complex significance his words had for living people.\r\n      “If you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you to get married,”\r\n       he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having found words he had\r\n      long been seeking.\nPrincess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as a\r\n      proof of how far away he now was from everything living.\n“Why talk of me?” she said quietly and glanced at Natásha.\nNatásha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again\r\n      silent.\n“Andrew, would you like...” Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling\r\n      voice, “would you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking about\r\n      you!”\nPrince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but Princess\r\n      Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did not smile\r\n      with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle irony\r\n      because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means\r\n      of arousing him.\n“Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?”\nWhen little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew’s room he looked at\r\n      his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else was\r\n      crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to\r\n      him.\nWhen Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her\r\n      brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to\r\n      cry.\nHe looked at her attentively.\n“Is it about Nicholas?” he asked.\nPrincess Mary nodded her head, weeping.\n“Mary, you know the Gosp...” but he broke off.\n“What did you say?”\n“Nothing. You mustn’t cry here,” he said, looking at her with the same\r\n      cold expression.\n\nWhen Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at the\r\n      thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With a great\r\n      effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of\r\n      view.\n“Yes, to them it must seem sad!” he thought. “But how simple it is.\n“The fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father\r\n      feedeth them,” he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary; “but\r\n      no, they will take it their own way, they won’t understand! They can’t\r\n      understand that all those feelings they prize so—all our feelings,\r\n      all those ideas that seem so important to us, areunnecessary. We cannot\r\n      understand one another,” and he remained silent.\n\nPrince Andrew’s little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew\r\n      nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge,\r\n      observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he\r\n      afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more profound\r\n      understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his\r\n      father, Mary, and Natásha, than he had then. He understood it completely,\r\n      and, leaving the room without crying, went silently up to Natásha who had\r\n      come out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful, thoughtful\r\n      eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head\r\n      against her he began to cry.\nAfter that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and\r\n      either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Natásha of whom\r\n      he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them quietly and\r\n      shyly.\nWhen Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what\r\n      Natásha’s face had told her. She did not speak any more to Natásha of\r\n      hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside his sofa, and did\r\n      not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in soul to that Eternal\r\n      and Unfathomable, whose presence above the dying man was now so evident."

    "text": "Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he was\r\n      dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an aloofness from\r\n      everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence.\r\n      Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming. That inexorable,\r\n      eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt\r\n      continually all his life—was now near to him and, by the strange\r\n      lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable....\n\nFormerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly\r\n      tormenting fear of death—the end—but now he no longer understood that\r\n      fear.\nHe had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top\r\n      before him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky,\r\n      and knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to himself\r\n      after being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love had\r\n      instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of\r\n      life that had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased to\r\n      think about it.\nDuring the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he spent\r\n      after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle\r\n      of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously detached\r\n      himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody and always to\r\n      sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not to live this\r\n      earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that principle of love,\r\n      the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that\r\n      dreadful barrier which—in the absence of such love—stands\r\n      between life and death. When during those first days he remembered that he\r\n      would have to die, he said to himself: “Well, what of it? So much the\r\n      better!”\nBut after the night in Mytíshchi when, half delirious, he had seen her for\r\n      whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her hand to his lips,\r\n      had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a particular woman again crept\r\n      unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life. And joyful and\r\n      agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. Recalling the moment at the\r\n      ambulance station when he had seen Kurágin, he could not now regain the\r\n      feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question whether Kurágin was\r\n      alive. And he dared not inquire.\nHis illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natásha referred\r\n      to when she said: “Thissuddenly happened,” had occurred two\r\n      days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle between\r\n      life and death, in which death gained the victory. It was the unexpected\r\n      realization of the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in\r\n      the form of his love for Natásha, and a last, though ultimately\r\n      vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.\nIt was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, and his\r\n      thoughts were preternaturally clear. Sónya was sitting by the table. He\r\n      began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.\n“Ah, she has come!” thought he.\nAnd so it was: in Sónya’s place sat Natásha who had just come in\r\n      noiselessly.\nSince she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced this\r\n      physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair\r\n      placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from him, and was\r\n      knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings since Prince Andrew\r\n      had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses\r\n      who knit stockings, and that there is something soothing in the knitting\r\n      of stockings. The needles clicked lightly in her slender, rapidly moving\r\n      hands, and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping\r\n      face. She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She started, glanced\r\n      round at him, and screening the candle with her hand stooped carefully\r\n      with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball, and regained her\r\n      former position.\nHe looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep\r\n      breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed\r\n      cautiously.\nAt the Tróitsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had told her\r\n      that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had brought\r\n      them together again, but after that they never spoke of the future.\n“Can it or can it not be?” he now thought as he looked at her and listened\r\n      to the light click of the steel needles. “Can fate have brought me to her\r\n      so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the truth of life\r\n      has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent my life in\r\n      falsity? I love her more than anything in the world! But what am I to do\r\n      if I love her?” he thought, and he involuntarily groaned, from a habit\r\n      acquired during his sufferings.\nOn hearing that sound Natásha put down the stocking, leaned nearer to him,\r\n      and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to him and\r\n      bent over him.\n“You are not asleep?”\n“No, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in. No one\r\n      else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do... that light. I\r\n      want to weep for joy.”\nNatásha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.\n“Natásha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.”\n“And I!”—She turned away for an instant. “Why too much?” she asked.\n“Why too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your soul, your\r\n      whole soul—shall I live? What do you think?”\n“I am sure of it, sure!” Natásha almost shouted, taking hold of both his\r\n      hands with a passionate movement.\nHe remained silent awhile.\n“How good it would be!” and taking her hand he kissed it.\nNatásha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would\r\n      not do and that he had to be quiet.\n“But you have not slept,” she said, repressing her joy. “Try to sleep...\r\n      please!”\nHe pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and\r\n      sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at him,\r\n      and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her\r\n      stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.\nSoon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and\r\n      suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.\nAs he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now\r\n      always occupied his mind—about life and death, and chiefly about\r\n      death. He felt himself nearer to it.\n“Love? What is love?” he thought.\n“Love hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I\r\n      understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only\r\n      because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to die\r\n      means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and eternal\r\n      source.” These thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were only\r\n      thoughts. Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they were\r\n      too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former\r\n      agitation and obscurity. He fell asleep.\nHe dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but that he was\r\n      quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and insignificant\r\n      people appeared before him. He talked to them and discussed something\r\n      trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere. Prince Andrew dimly\r\n      realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares,\r\n      but he continued to speak, surprising them by empty witticisms. Gradually,\r\n      unnoticed, all these persons began to disappear and a single question,\r\n      that of the closed door, superseded all else. He rose and went to the door\r\n      to bolt and lock it. Everything depended on whether he was, or was not, in\r\n      time to lock it. He went, and tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move\r\n      and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully\r\n      strained all his powers. He was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear\r\n      was the fear of death.Itstood behind the door. But just when he was\r\n      clumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the other\r\n      side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in. Something not\r\n      human—death—was breaking in through that door, and had to be\r\n      kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it back—to\r\n      lock it was no longer possible—but his efforts were weak and clumsy\r\n      and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and closed again.\nOnce againitpushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain\r\n      and both halves of the door noiselessly opened.Itentered, and it wasdeath, and Prince Andrew died.\nBut at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep,\r\n      and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke.\n“Yes, it was death! I died—and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!”\r\n       And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then\r\n      concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as if\r\n      powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that strange\r\n      lightness did not again leave him.\nWhen, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, Natásha went\r\n      up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at her\r\n      strangely, not understanding.\nThat was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary’s arrival.\r\n      From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever assumed a\r\n      malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest Natásha,\r\n      she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing.\nFrom that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with\r\n      his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration of life it did not\r\n      seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration\r\n      of a dream.\nThere was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow\r\n      awakening.\nHis last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both\r\n      Princess Mary and Natásha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did not\r\n      weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they\r\n      were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left them) but\r\n      on what reminded them most closely of him—his body. Both felt this\r\n      so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect\r\n      them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief. Neither in\r\n      his presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever talk to one\r\n      another about him. They felt that they could not express in words what\r\n      they understood.\nThey both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and deeper,\r\n      away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was\r\n      right.\nHe confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of him.\r\n      When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boy’s and\r\n      turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and\r\n      Natásha understood that) but simply because he thought it was all that was\r\n      required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did what was\r\n      demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he\r\n      should do.\nWhen the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,\r\n      occurred, Princess Mary and Natásha were present.\n“Is it over?” said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes lain\r\n      motionless, growing cold before them. Natásha went up, looked at the dead\r\n      eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but did not kiss them,\r\n      but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him—his body.\n“Where has he gone? Where is he now?...”\nWhen the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table, everyone\r\n      came to take leave of him and they all wept.\nLittle Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity.\r\n      The countess and Sónya cried from pity for Natásha and because he was no\r\n      more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too, must\r\n      take the same terrible step.\nNatásha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their own\r\n      personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had\r\n      taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and\r\n      solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence."

    "text": "Man’s mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but\r\n      the desire to find those causes is implanted in man’s soul. And without\r\n      considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of\r\n      which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he snatches at the first\r\n      approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says: “This is\r\n      the cause!” In historical events (where the actions of men are the subject\r\n      of observation) the first and most primitive approximation to present\r\n      itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will of those who\r\n      stood in the most prominent position—the heroes of history. But we\r\n      need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event—which lies\r\n      in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it—to be\r\n      convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions\r\n      of the mass but is itself continually controlled. It may seem to be a\r\n      matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical\r\n      events this way or that; yet there is the same difference between a man\r\n      who says that the people of the West moved on the East because Napoleon\r\n      wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen,\r\n      as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and\r\n      that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not\r\n      know what upheld the earth, but knew there were laws directing its\r\n      movement and that of the other planets. There is, and can be, no cause of\r\n      an historical event except the one cause of all causes. But there are laws\r\n      directing events, and some of these laws are known to us while we are\r\n      conscious of others we cannot comprehend. The discovery of these laws is\r\n      only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find the cause\r\n      in the will of some one man, just as the discovery of the laws of the\r\n      motion of the planets was possible only when men abandoned the conception\r\n      of the fixity of the earth.\nThe historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodinó and the\r\n      occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the most\r\n      important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the Russian army\r\n      from the Ryazána to the Kalúga road and to the Tarútino camp—the\r\n      so-called flank march across the Krásnaya Pakhrá River. They ascribe the\r\n      glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to\r\n      whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians, including the French,\r\n      acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of that\r\n      flank march. But it is hard to understand why military writers, and\r\n      following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound\r\n      conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. In the\r\n      first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of\r\n      this movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that the\r\n      best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are\r\n      most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that\r\n      the best position for an army after its retreat from Moscow in 1812 was on\r\n      the Kalúga road. So it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the\r\n      historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one. And\r\n      it is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this\r\n      maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy the French; for this\r\n      flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied, or followed by other\r\n      circumstances, might have proved ruinous to the Russians and salutary for\r\n      the French. If the position of the Russian army really began to improve\r\n      from the time of that march, it does not at all follow that the march was\r\n      the cause of it.\nThat flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the\r\n      Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its\r\n      destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If Murat\r\n      had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained inactive?\r\n      If the Russian army at Krásnaya Pakhrá had given battle as Bennigsen and\r\n      Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French attacked the\r\n      Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhrá? What would have\r\n      happened if on approaching Tarútino, Napoleon had attacked the Russians\r\n      with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at\r\n      Smolénsk? What would have happened had the French moved on Petersburg?...\r\n      In any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might\r\n      have proved disastrous.\nThe third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history\r\n      deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed to\r\n      any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in reality, like the\r\n      retreat from Filí, it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entirety,\r\n      but resulted—moment by moment, step by step, event by event—from\r\n      an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its\r\n      entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past.\nAt the council at Filí the prevailing thought in the minds of the Russian\r\n      commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a direct\r\n      retreat by the Nízhni road. In proof of this there is the fact that the\r\n      majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and above all there is\r\n      the well-known conversation after the council, between the commander in\r\n      chief and Lanskóy, who was in charge of the commissariat department.\r\n      Lanskóy informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for\r\n      the most part stored along the Oká in the Túla and Ryazán provinces, and\r\n      that if they retreated on Nízhni the army would be separated from its\r\n      supplies by the broad river Oká, which cannot be crossed early in winter.\r\n      This was the first indication of the necessity of deviating from what had\r\n      previously seemed the most natural course—a direct retreat on\r\n      Nízhni-Nóvgorod. The army turned more to the south, along the Ryazán road\r\n      and nearer to its supplies. Subsequently the inactivity of the French (who\r\n      even lost sight of the Russian army), concern for the safety of the\r\n      arsenal at Túla, and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its\r\n      supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the Túla road.\r\n      Having crossed over, by a forced march, to the Túla road beyond the\r\n      Pakhrá, the Russian commanders intended to remain at Podólsk and had no\r\n      thought of the Tarútino position; but innumerable circumstances and the\r\n      reappearance of French troops who had for a time lost touch with the\r\n      Russians, and projects of giving battle, and above all the abundance of\r\n      provisions in Kalúga province, obliged our army to turn still more to the\r\n      south and to cross from the Túla to the Kalúga road and go to Tarútino,\r\n      which was between the roads along which those supplies lay. Just as it is\r\n      impossible to say when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is\r\n      impossible to say precisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to\r\n      Tarútino. Only when the army had got there, as the result of innumerable\r\n      and varying forces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had\r\n      desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result."

    "text": "The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance of\r\n      the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually\r\n      retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct\r\n      course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the\r\n      district where supplies were abundant.\nIf instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the\r\n      Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not have\r\n      done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing an arc\r\n      in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the\r\n      country was richest.\nThat movement from the Nízhni to the Ryazán, Túla, and Kalúga roads was so\r\n      natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and\r\n      demands were sent from Petersburg for Kutúzov to take his army that way.\r\n      At Tarútino Kutúzov received what was almost a reprimand from the Emperor\r\n      for having moved his army along the Ryazán road, and the Emperor’s letter\r\n      indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near Kalúga.\nHaving rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the\r\n      whole campaign and by the battle of Borodinó, the Russian army—when\r\n      the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received—assumed\r\n      the position natural to it.\nKutúzov’s merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is\r\n      called, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what\r\n      had happened. He alone then understood the meaning of the French army’s\r\n      inactivity, he alone continued to assert that the battle of Borodinó had\r\n      been a victory, he alone—who as commander in chief might have been\r\n      expected to be eager to attack—employed his whole strength to\r\n      restrain the Russian army from useless engagements.\nThe beast wounded at Borodinó was lying where the fleeing hunter had left\r\n      him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and merely\r\n      lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was heard to moan.\nThe moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed its\r\n      calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutúzov’s camp with\r\n      overtures for peace.\nNapoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was\r\n      right, wrote to Kutúzov the first words that occurred to him, though they\r\n      were meaningless.\n\nMONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general to\r\n      discuss several interesting questions with you. I beg your Highness to\r\n      credit what he says to you,especially when he expresses the sentiment of\r\n      esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your person. This\r\n      letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le prince Koutouzov,\r\n      to keep you in His holy and gracious protection!\nNAPOLEON\nMOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812\n\nKutúzov replied: “I should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as the\r\n      initiator of a settlement of any sort.Such is the present spirit of my\r\n      nation.” But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops\r\n      from attacking.\nDuring the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and the\r\n      Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tarútino, a change had taken place\r\n      in the relative strength of the two armies—both in spirit and in\r\n      number—as a result of which the superiority had passed to the\r\n      Russian side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were\r\n      unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of\r\n      attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were:\r\n      Lauriston’s mission; the abundance of provisions at Tarútino; the reports\r\n      coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the\r\n      flow of recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the\r\n      Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been\r\n      assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been\r\n      resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of, was\r\n      doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the\r\n      French stationed at Tarútino; the news of easy successes gained by\r\n      peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this;\r\n      the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as\r\n      the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every\r\n      soldier’s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and\r\n      that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial change in\r\n      the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable. And at once,\r\n      as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand has\r\n      completed a full circle, this change was shown by an increased activity,\r\n      whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres."

    "text": "The Russian army was commanded by Kutúzov and his staff, and also by the\r\n      Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of Moscow had\r\n      been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign had\r\n      been drawn up and sent to Kutúzov for his guidance. Though this plan had\r\n      been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands, it\r\n      was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action. Kutúzov only\r\n      replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to\r\n      execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties\r\n      that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who were to watch\r\n      Kutúzov’s actions and report upon them.\nBesides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized. The\r\n      posts left vacant by Bagratión, who had been killed, and by Barclay, who\r\n      had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious consideration was\r\n      given to the question whether it would be better to put A in B’s place and\r\n      B in D’s, or on the contrary to put D in A’s place, and so on—as if\r\n      anything more than A’s or B’s satisfaction depended on this.\nAs a result of the hostility between Kutúzov and Bennigsen, his Chief of\r\n      Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the Emperor, and\r\n      these transfers, a more than usually complicated play of parties was going\r\n      on among the staff of the army. A was undermining B, D was undermining C,\r\n      and so on in all possible combinations and permutations. In all these\r\n      plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war,\r\n      which all these men believed they were directing; but this affair of the\r\n      war went on independently of them, as it had to go: that is, never in the\r\n      way people devised, but flowing always from the essential attitude of the\r\n      masses. Only in the highest spheres did all these schemes, crossings, and\r\n      interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen.\n\nPrince Michael Ilariónovich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of October\r\n      in a letter that reached Kutúzov after the battle at Tarútino) Since\r\n      September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last reports\r\n      were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has no\r\n      action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient\r\n      capital, but according to your last report you have even retreated\r\n      farther. Sérpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and Túla\r\n      with its famous arsenal, so indispensable to the army, is in danger. From\r\n      General Wintzingerode’s reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten thousand\r\n      men is moving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several thousand\r\n      men is moving on Dmítrov. A third has advanced along the Vladímir road,\r\n      and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed between Rúza and\r\n      Mozháysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as the twenty-fifth. In\r\n      view of all this information, when the enemy has scattered his forces in\r\n      large detachments, and with Napoleon and his Guards in Moscow, is it\r\n      possible that the enemy’s forces confronting you are so considerable as\r\n      not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the contrary, he is probably\r\n      pursuing you with detachments, or at most with an army corps much weaker\r\n      than the army entrusted to you. It would seem that, availing yourself of\r\n      these circumstances, you might advantageously attack a weaker one and\r\n      annihilate him, or at least oblige him to retreat, retaining in our hands\r\n      an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy, and thereby\r\n      averting danger from Túla and other towns in the interior. You will be\r\n      responsible if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against\r\n      Petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been possible to\r\n      retain many troops; for with the army entrusted to you, and acting with\r\n      resolution and energy, you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity.\r\n      Remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for the\r\n      loss of Moscow. You have experienced my readiness to reward you. That\r\n      readiness will not weaken in me, but I and Russia have a right to expect\r\n      from you all the zeal, firmness, and success which your intellect,\r\n      military talent, and the courage of the troops you command justify us in\r\n      expecting.\n\nBut by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of the\r\n      forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched, Kutúzov\r\n      had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded from\r\n      attacking and a battle had taken place.\nOn the second of October a Cossack, Shapoválov, who was out scouting,\r\n      killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded hare he made\r\n      his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Murat’s army,\r\n      encamped there without any precautions. The Cossack laughingly told his\r\n      comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the French. A cornet,\r\n      hearing the story, informed his commander.\nThe Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished to\r\n      take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of the\r\n      superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,\r\n      reported the incident to a general on the staff. The state of things on\r\n      the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. Ermólov had been to see\r\n      Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence\r\n      with the commander in chief to induce him to take the offensive.\n“If I did not know you I should think you did not want what you are asking\r\n      for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure to do the\r\n      opposite,” replied Bennigsen.\nThe Cossack’s report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out, was\r\n      the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled spring was\r\n      released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play. Despite all his\r\n      supposed power, his intellect, his experience, and his knowledge of men,\r\n      Kutúzov—having taken into consideration the Cossack’s report, a note\r\n      from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to the Emperor, the wishes he\r\n      supposed the Emperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals expressed\r\n      the same wish—could no longer check the inevitable movement, and\r\n      gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful—gave\r\n      his approval, that is, to the accomplished fact."

    "text": "Bennigsen’s note and the Cossack’s information that the left flank of the\r\n      French was unguarded were merely final indications that it was necessary\r\n      to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of October.\nOn the morning of the fourth of October Kutúzov signed the dispositions.\r\n      Toll read them to Ermólov, asking him to attend to the further\r\n      arrangements.\n“All right—all right. I haven’t time just now,” replied Ermólov, and\r\n      left the hut.\nThe dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the Austerlitz\r\n      dispositions, it was written—though not in German this time:\n“The First Column will march here and here,” “the Second Column will march\r\n      there and there,” and so on; and on paper, all these columns arrived at\r\n      their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy. Everything had\r\n      been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions, and as is always\r\n      the case, not a single column reached its place at the appointed time.\nWhen the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared,\r\n      an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to Ermólov to deal with.\r\n      A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kutúzov’s orderly, pleased at the\r\n      importance of the mission entrusted to him, went to Ermólov’s quarters.\n“Gone away,” said Ermólov’s orderly.\nThe officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom Ermólov was\r\n      often to be found.\n“No, and the general’s out too.”\nThe officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.\n“No, he’s gone out.”\n“If only they don’t make me responsible for this delay! What a nuisance it\r\n      is!” thought the officer, and he rode round the whole camp. One man said\r\n      he had seen Ermólov ride past with some other generals, others said he\r\n      must have returned home. The officer searched till six o’clock in the\r\n      evening without even stopping to eat. Ermólov was nowhere to be found and\r\n      no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at a\r\n      comrade’s, and rode again to the vanguard to find Milorádovich.\r\n      Milorádovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a ball\r\n      at General Kíkin’s and that Ermólov was probably there too.\n“But where is it?”\n“Why, there, over at Échkino,” said a Cossack officer, pointing to a\r\n      country house in the far distance.\n“What, outside our line?”\n“They’ve put two regiments as outposts, and they’re having such a spree\r\n      there, it’s awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!”\nThe officer rode out beyond our lines to Échkino. While still at a\r\n      distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier’s dance song\r\n      proceeding from the house.\n“In the meadows... in the meadows!” he heard, accompanied by whistling and\r\n      the sound of atorban, drowned every now and then by shouts. These sounds\r\n      made his spirits rise, but at the same time he was afraid that he would be\r\n      blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to\r\n      him. It was already past eight o’clock. He dismounted and went up into the\r\n      porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the\r\n      Russian and French forces. In the refreshment room and the hall, footmen\r\n      were bustling about with wine and viands. Groups of singers stood outside\r\n      the windows. The officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief\r\n      generals of the army together, and among them Ermólov’s big imposing\r\n      figure. They all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a\r\n      semicircle with flushed and animated faces, laughing loudly. In the middle\r\n      of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing thetrepákwith much spirit and agility.\n“Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Iványch! Ha, ha, ha!”\nThe officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment\r\n      he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait; but one of\r\n      the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come about, informed\r\n      Ermólov.\nErmólov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the\r\n      officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.\n\n“You think he went off just by chance?” said a comrade, who was on the\r\n      staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to\r\n      Ermólov. “It was a trick. It was done on purpose to get Konovnítsyn into\r\n      trouble. You’ll see what a mess there’ll be tomorrow.”"

    "text": "Next day the decrepit Kutúzov, having given orders to be called early,\r\n      said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness of having\r\n      to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into hiscalècheand drove\r\n      from Letashóvka (a village three and a half miles from Tarútino) to the\r\n      place where the attacking columns were to meet. He sat in thecalèche,\r\n      dozing and waking up by turns, and listening for any sound of firing on\r\n      the right as an indication that the action had begun. But all was still\r\n      quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning. On approaching\r\n      Tarútino Kutúzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to water across\r\n      the road along which he was driving. Kutúzov looked at them searchingly,\r\n      stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they belonged to. They\r\n      belonged to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long\r\n      before then. “It may be a mistake,” thought the old commander in chief.\r\n      But a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their arms piled\r\n      and the soldiers, only partly dressed, eating their rye porridge and\r\n      carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The officer reported that no order\r\n      to advance had been received.\n“How! Not rec...” Kutúzov began, but checked himself immediately and sent\r\n      for a senior officer. Getting out of hiscalèche, he waited with drooping\r\n      head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down. When Eýkhen, the\r\n      officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared, Kutúzov went\r\n      purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame for the mistake,\r\n      but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his\r\n      wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell into that state of fury\r\n      in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground, and he fell upon Eýkhen,\r\n      threatening him with his hands, shouting and loading him with gross abuse.\r\n      Another man, Captain Brózin, who happened to turn up and who was not at\r\n      all to blame, suffered the same fate.\n“What sort of another blackguard are you? I’ll have you shot! Scoundrels!”\r\n       yelled Kutúzov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and reeling.\nHe was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene Highness\r\n      who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had in Russia,\r\n      to be placed in this position—made the laughingstock of the whole\r\n      army! “I needn’t have been in such a hurry to pray about today, or have\r\n      kept awake thinking everything over all night,” thought he to himself.\r\n      “When I was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to mock me so...\r\n      and now!” He was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal\r\n      punishment, and could not avoid expressing it by cries of anger and\r\n      distress. But his strength soon began to fail him, and looking about him,\r\n      conscious of having said much that was amiss, he again got into hiscalècheand drove back in silence.\nHis wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he listened\r\n      to excuses and self-justifications (Ermólov did not come to see him till\r\n      the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, Konovnítsyn, and Toll\r\n      that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next day. And\r\n      once more Kutúzov had to consent."

    "text": "Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening and\r\n      advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with dark purple clouds,\r\n      but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops advanced\r\n      noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be\r\n      faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk out loud, to smoke their\r\n      pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried to prevent their horses\r\n      neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they\r\n      marched gaily. Some columns, supposing they had reached their destination,\r\n      halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground, but the majority\r\n      marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not\r\n      have been.\nOnly Count Orlóv-Denísov with his Cossacks (the least important detachment\r\n      of all) got to his appointed place at the right time. This detachment\r\n      halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path leading from the village\r\n      of Stromílova to Dmítrovsk.\nToward dawn, Count Orlóv-Denísov, who had dozed off, was awakened by a\r\n      deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a Polish\r\n      sergeant of Poniatowski’s corps, who explained in Polish that he had come\r\n      over because he had been slighted in the service: that he ought long ago\r\n      to have been made an officer, that he was braver than any of them, and so\r\n      he had left them and wished to pay them out. He said that Murat was\r\n      spending the night less than a mile from where they were, and that if they\r\n      would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive.\r\n      Count Orlóv-Denísov consulted his fellow officers.\nThe offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go and\r\n      everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and arguing,\r\n      Major-General Grékov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the\r\n      Polish sergeant.\n“Now, remember,” said Count Orlóv-Denísov to the sergeant at parting, “if\r\n      you have been lying I’ll have you hanged like a dog; but if it’s true you\r\n      shall have a hundred gold pieces!”\nWithout replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and rode away\r\n      with Grékov whose men had quickly assembled. They disappeared into the\r\n      forest, and Count Orlóv-Denísov, having seen Grékov off, returned,\r\n      shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he had\r\n      undertaken on his own responsibility, and began looking at the enemy camp,\r\n      now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires.\r\n      Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his\r\n      right. He looked in that direction, but though the columns would have been\r\n      visible quite far off, they were not to be seen. It seemed to the count\r\n      that things were beginning to stir in the French camp, and his\r\n      keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this.\n“Oh, it is really too late,” said Count Orlóv, looking at the camp.\nAs often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our\r\n      eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant\r\n      was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian attack would\r\n      be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which he would lead away\r\n      heaven only knew where. How could one capture a commander in chief from\r\n      among such a mass of troops!\n“I am sure that rascal was lying,” said the count.\n“They can still be called back,” said one of his suite, who like Count\r\n      Orlóv felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemy’s\r\n      camp.\n“Eh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?”\n“Will you have them fetched back?”\n“Fetch them back, fetch them back!” said Count Orlóv with sudden\r\n      determination, looking at his watch. “It will be too late. It is quite\r\n      light.”\nAnd the adjutant galloped through the forest after Grékov. When Grékov\r\n      returned, Count Orlóv-Denísov, excited both by the abandoned attempt and\r\n      by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear, as well\r\n      as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance. All his men felt\r\n      the same excitement.\n“Mount!” he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and crossed\r\n      themselves.... “Forward, with God’s aid!”\n“Hurrah-ah-ah!” reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack companies,\r\n      trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out of\r\n      a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.\nOne desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw the\r\n      Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just waking up,\r\n      ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and horses.\nHad the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind and\r\n      around them, they would have captured Murat and everything there. That was\r\n      what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the Cossacks\r\n      budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of them listened to\r\n      orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were taken on the\r\n      spot, besides standards and (what seemed most important to the Cossacks)\r\n      horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. All this had to be dealt with,\r\n      the prisoners and guns secured, the booty divided—not without some\r\n      shouting and even a little fighting among themselves—and it was on\r\n      this that the Cossacks all busied themselves.\nThe French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: they\r\n      formed into detachments and began firing. Orlóv-Denísov, still waiting for\r\n      the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.\nMeantime, according to the dispositions which said that “the First Column\r\n      will march” and so on, the infantry of the belated columns, commanded by\r\n      Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order and, as always\r\n      happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed places. As always\r\n      happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt; murmurs were heard,\r\n      there was a sense of confusion, and finally a backward movement. Adjutants\r\n      and generals galloped about, shouted, grew angry, quarreled, said they had\r\n      come quite wrong and were late, gave vent to a little abuse, and at last\r\n      gave it all up and went forward, simply to get somewhere. “We shall get\r\n      somewhere or other!” And they did indeed get somewhere, though not to\r\n      their right places; a few eventually even got to their right place, but\r\n      too late to be of any use and only in time to be fired at. Toll, who in\r\n      this battle played the part of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped\r\n      assiduously from place to place, finding everything upside down\r\n      everywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagovút’s corps in a wood when it was\r\n      already broad daylight, though the corps should long before have joined\r\n      Orlóv-Denísov. Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone\r\n      must be responsible for it, Toll galloped up to the commander of the corps\r\n      and began upbraiding him severely, saying that he ought to be shot.\r\n      General Bagovút, a fighting old soldier of placid temperament, being also\r\n      upset by all the delay, confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to\r\n      everybody’s surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said\r\n      disagreeable things to Toll.\n“I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as\r\n      well as anybody,” he said, and advanced with a single division.\nComing out onto a field under the enemy’s fire, this brave general went\r\n      straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering in his\r\n      agitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would be\r\n      of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he\r\n      needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other\r\n      bullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for\r\n      some time quite uselessly."

    "text": "Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front,\r\n      but Kutúzov accompanied that column. He well knew that nothing but\r\n      confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will, and as\r\n      far as was in his power held the troops back. He did not advance.\nHe rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering suggestions\r\n      that they should attack.\n“The wordattackis always on your tongue, but you don’t see\r\n      that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers,” said he to\r\n      Milorádovich who asked permission to advance.\n“We couldn’t take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in time,\r\n      and nothing can be done now!” he replied to someone else.\nWhen Kutúzov was informed that at the French rear—where according to\r\n      the reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody—there\r\n      were now two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at Ermólov who\r\n      was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day.\n“You see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds, but as\r\n      soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy, forewarned,\r\n      takes measures accordingly.”\nErmólov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words. He\r\n      understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that Kutúzov would\r\n      content himself with that hint.\n“He’s having a little fun at my expense,” said Ermólov softly, nudging\r\n      with his knee Raévski who was at his side.\nSoon after this, Ermólov moved up to Kutúzov and respectfully remarked:\n“It is not too late yet, your Highness—the enemy has not gone away—if\r\n      you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see a\r\n      little smoke.”\nKutúzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat’s troops\r\n      were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he\r\n      halted for three quarters of an hour.\nThe whole battle consisted in what Orlóv-Denísov’s Cossacks had done: the\r\n      rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.\nIn consequence of this battle Kutúzov received a diamond decoration, and\r\n      Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also\r\n      received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades, and\r\n      following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.\n“That’s how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!” said the Russian\r\n      officers and generals after the Tarútino battle, letting it be understood\r\n      that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves\r\n      should not have done so, just as people speak today. But people who talk\r\n      like that either do not know what they are talking about or deliberately\r\n      deceive themselves. No battle—Tarútino, Borodinó, or Austerlitz—takes\r\n      place as those who planned it anticipated. That is an essential condition.\nA countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during a\r\n      battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence the course\r\n      taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in advance and\r\n      never coincides with the direction of any one force.\nIf many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body,\r\n      the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces,\r\n      but will always be a mean—what in mechanics is represented by the\r\n      diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.\nIf in the descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we\r\n      find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously\r\n      formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions\r\n      are false.\nThe battle of Tarútino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in view—to\r\n      lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions;\r\n      nor that which Count Orlóv-Denísov may have had in view—to take\r\n      Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps,\r\n      which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor the aim of the\r\n      officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself; nor that of\r\n      the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and so on. But if the aim\r\n      of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the Russians of that\r\n      day desired—to drive the French out of Russia and destroy their army—it\r\n      is quite clear that the battle of Tarútino, just because of its\r\n      incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign.\r\n      It would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more\r\n      opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. With a minimum of effort\r\n      and insignificant losses, despite the greatest confusion, the most\r\n      important results of the whole campaign were attained: the transition from\r\n      retreat to advance, an exposure of the weakness of the French, and the\r\n      administration of that shock which Napoleon’s army had only awaited to\r\n      begin its flight."

    "text": "Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victoryde la Moskowa; there\r\n      can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands\r\n      of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital.\r\n      Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and incalculable wealth,\r\n      is in Napoleon’s hands. The Russian army, only half the strength of the\r\n      French, does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month.\r\n      Napoleon’s position is most brilliant. He can either fall on the Russian\r\n      army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate an advantageous\r\n      peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on Petersburg, or\r\n      even, in the case of a reverse, return to Smolénsk or Vílna; or remain in\r\n      Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be required to retain\r\n      the brilliant position the French held at that time. For that, only very\r\n      simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow the troops to loot, to\r\n      prepare winter clothing—of which there was sufficient in Moscow for\r\n      the whole army—and methodically to collect the provisions, of which\r\n      (according to the French historians) there were enough in Moscow to supply\r\n      the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon, that greatest of all\r\n      geniuses, who the historians declare had control of the army, took none of\r\n      these steps.\nHe not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his\r\n      power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to\r\n      him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in Moscow, advancing\r\n      on Petersburg or on Nízhni-Nóvgorod, or retiring by a more northerly or\r\n      more southerly route (say by the road Kutúzov afterwards took), nothing\r\n      more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did. He\r\n      remained in Moscow till October, letting the troops plunder the city;\r\n      then, hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind him, he quitted\r\n      Moscow, approached Kutúzov without joining battle, turned to the right and\r\n      reached Málo-Yaroslávets, again without attempting to break through and\r\n      take the road Kutúzov took, but retiring instead to Mozháysk along the\r\n      devastated Smolénsk road. Nothing more stupid than that could have been\r\n      devised, or more disastrous for the army, as the sequel showed. Had\r\n      Napoleon’s aim been to destroy his army, the most skillful strategist\r\n      could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely\r\n      have accomplished that purpose, independently of anything the Russian army\r\n      might do.\nNapoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his\r\n      army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as\r\n      unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he\r\n      wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.\nIn both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the\r\n      personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that\r\n      guided the event.\nThe historians quite falsely represent Napoleon’s faculties as having\r\n      weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify his\r\n      actions. He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could\r\n      for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did\r\n      subsequently in 1813. His activity at that time was no less astounding\r\n      than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not know\r\n      for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egypt—where forty\r\n      centuries looked down upon his grandeur—for his great exploits there\r\n      are all told us by Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in\r\n      Austria or Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French or\r\n      German sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without\r\n      fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans to\r\n      recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in\r\n      Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius in order\r\n      to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the matter\r\n      plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.\nHis activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere.\r\n      Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he\r\n      entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence of citizens and of a\r\n      deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not disconcert him. He did\r\n      not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the\r\n      enemy, or of the welfare of the people of Russia, or of the direction of\r\n      affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of\r\n      the anticipated peace."

    "text": "With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry into\r\n      Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of\r\n      the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and\r\n      charged Murat to find Kutúzov. Then he gave careful directions about the\r\n      fortification of the Krémlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future\r\n      campaign over the whole map of Russia.\nWith regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain Yákovlev,\r\n      who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of\r\n      Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity,\r\n      and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he\r\n      considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that Rostopchín\r\n      had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched Yákovlev to Petersburg.\nHaving similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tutólmin, he\r\n      dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.\nWith regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders\r\n      to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopchín was\r\n      punished by an order to burn down his houses.\nWith regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a constitution.\r\n      A municipality was established and the following announcement issued:\n\nINHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!\nYour misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King desires\r\n      to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he punishes\r\n      disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to put an end to\r\n      disorder and to re-establish public security. A paternal administration,\r\n      chosen from among yourselves, will form your municipality or city\r\n      government. It will take care of you, of your needs, and of your welfare.\r\n      Its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the\r\n      shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well. But\r\n      when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm.\nThe city police is established on its former footing, and better order\r\n      already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has\r\n      appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty\r\n      commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different\r\n      wards of the city. You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will\r\n      wear on the left arm. Several churches of different denominations are\r\n      open, and divine service is performed in them unhindered. Your fellow\r\n      citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been given\r\n      that they should find in them the help and protection due to their\r\n      misfortunes. These are the measures the government has adopted to\r\n      re-establish order and relieve your condition. But to achieve this aim it\r\n      is necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if possible,\r\n      forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain the hope of a\r\n      less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and ignominious death\r\n      awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains of\r\n      your property, and finally that you should not doubt that these will be\r\n      safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest and most just of\r\n      monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you may be,\r\n      re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of a state, live\r\n      like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to another, unite to\r\n      defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the military and civil\r\n      authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!\n\nWith regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the troops\r\n      in turn should enter Moscowà la maraude* to obtain provisions for\r\n      themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.\n* As looters.\nWith regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back\r\n      and services to be again performed in the churches.\nWith regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was\r\n      placarded everywhere:\nPROCLAMATION\nYou, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom misfortune\r\n      has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of the soil, still\r\n      kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen! Tranquillity is\r\n      returning to this capital and order is being restored in it. Your fellow\r\n      countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places on finding that\r\n      they are respected. Any violence to them or to their property is promptly\r\n      punished. His Majesty the Emperor and King protects them, and considers no\r\n      one among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders. He desires to\r\n      end your misfortunes and restore you to your homes and families. Respond,\r\n      therefore, to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear.\r\n      Inhabitants, return with confidence to your abodes! You will soon find\r\n      means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen and industrious artisans, return\r\n      to your work, your houses, your shops, where the protection of guards\r\n      awaits you! You shall receive proper pay for your work. And lastly you\r\n      too, peasants, come from the forests where you are hiding in terror,\r\n      return to your huts without fear, in full assurance that you will find\r\n      protection! Markets are established in the city where peasants can bring\r\n      their surplus supplies and the products of the soil. The government has\r\n      taken the following steps to ensure freedom of sale for them: (1) From\r\n      today, peasants, husbandmen, and those living in the neighborhood of\r\n      Moscow may without any danger bring their supplies of all kinds to two\r\n      appointed markets, of which one is on the Mokhováya Street and the other\r\n      at the Provision Market. (2) Such supplies will be bought from them at\r\n      such prices as seller and buyer may agree on, and if a seller is unable to\r\n      obtain a fair price he will be free to take his goods back to his village\r\n      and no one may hinder him under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday of\r\n      each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end a\r\n      sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on\r\n      Tuesdays and Saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect the\r\n      carts. (4) Similar measures will be taken that peasants with their carts\r\n      and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey. (5) Steps\r\n      will immediately be taken to re-establish ordinary trading.\nInhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and artisans, to\r\n      whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry out the paternal\r\n      intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to co-operate with him\r\n      for the public welfare! Lay your respect and confidence at his feet and do\r\n      not delay to unite with us!\n\nWith the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people,\r\n      reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The Emperor rode\r\n      through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his\r\n      preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were\r\n      established by his order.\nIn regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads, Napoleon\r\n      also did all in his power. He caused the wordsMaison de ma Mèreto be\r\n      inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining tender filial\r\n      affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He visited the\r\n      Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him to kiss his\r\n      white hands, graciously conversed with Tutólmin. Then, as Thiers\r\n      eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged Russian\r\n      money which he had prepared: “Raising the use of these means by an act\r\n      worthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief be distributed to\r\n      those who had been burned out. But as food was too precious to be given to\r\n      foreigners, who were for the most part enemies, Napoleon preferred to\r\n      supply them with money with which to purchase food from outside, and had\r\n      paper rubles distributed to them.”\nWith reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued to\r\n      inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties and to\r\n      suppress robbery."

    "text": "But strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans—which\r\n      were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances—did\r\n      not affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock\r\n      detached from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way\r\n      without engaging the cogwheels.\nWith reference to the military side—the plan of campaign—that\r\n      work of genius of which Thiers remarks that, “His genius never devised\r\n      anything more profound, more skillful, or more admirable,” and enters into\r\n      a polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred\r\n      not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October—that plan never\r\n      was or could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the facts of\r\n      the case. The fortifying of the Krémlin, for whichla Mosquée(as Napoleon\r\n      termed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have been razed to the\r\n      ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the Krémlin only helped toward\r\n      fulfilling Napoleon’s wish that it should be blown up when he left Moscow—as\r\n      a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten. The\r\n      pursuit of the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so concerned,\r\n      produced an unheard-of result. The French generals lost touch with the\r\n      Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it was only\r\n      eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skill—and apparently the\r\n      genius—of Murat.\nWith reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon’s arguments as to his\r\n      magnanimity and justice, both to Tutólmin and to Yákovlev (whose chief\r\n      concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;\r\n      Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their\r\n      embassage.\nWith regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed\r\n      incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.\nWith regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a municipality\r\n      did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people who\r\n      formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order\r\n      looted Moscow or saved their own property from being looted.\nWith regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so easily been\r\n      settled by Napoleon’s visit to a mosque, no results were achieved. Two or\r\n      three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out Napoleon’s\r\n      wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French soldier while\r\n      conducting service, and a French official reported of another that: “The\r\n      priest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned and locked up the\r\n      church. That night the doors were again broken open, the padlocks smashed,\r\n      the books mutilated, and other disorders perpetrated.”\nWith reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen and to\r\n      peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious workmen, and the\r\n      peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town with the\r\n      proclamation and killed them.\nAs to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,\r\n      these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the Krémlin\r\n      and in Posnyákov’s house were closed again at once because the actors and\r\n      actresses were robbed.\nEven philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as well as\r\n      the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The French,\r\n      collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the paper money\r\n      valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate, but\r\n      even silver lost its value in relation to gold.\nBut the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by\r\n      the authorities at that time was Napoleon’s attempt to stop the looting\r\n      and re-establish discipline.\nThis is what the army authorities were reporting:\n“Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order is\r\n      not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a\r\n      lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen\r\n      goods.”\n“The neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the\r\n      3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants\r\n      hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have the ferocity to\r\n      wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly witnessed.”\n“Nothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging—October\r\n      9.”\n“Robbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our\r\n      district who ought to be arrested by a strong force—October 11.”\n“The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to\r\n      stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning\r\n      to the Krémlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed more\r\n      violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The Emperor\r\n      sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person,\r\n      who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to such a\r\n      point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army\r\n      supplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying\r\n      sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.”\n“The Grand Marshal of the palace,” wrote the governor, “complains bitterly\r\n      that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to commit\r\n      nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the\r\n      Emperor.”\nThat army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the\r\n      provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and\r\n      perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it did not go\r\n      away.\nIt began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the\r\n      capture of transport trains on the Smolénsk road, and by the battle of\r\n      Tarútino. The news of that battle of Tarútino, unexpectedly received by\r\n      Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians\r\n      (Thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole army\r\n      was demanding.\nFleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had\r\n      stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personaltrésor, but on seeing\r\n      the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers says)\r\n      horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not order all the\r\n      superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a certain\r\n      marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at thecalèchesand carriages in\r\n      which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing, as\r\n      those vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the sick, and the\r\n      wounded.\nThe plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which\r\n      feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the\r\n      skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it\r\n      entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and\r\n      shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal,\r\n      hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter’s gun, runs forward and\r\n      back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his\r\n      whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of Tarútino\r\n      frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunter’s gun, reached\r\n      him, turned back, and finally—like any wild beast—ran back\r\n      along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was\r\n      familiar.\nDuring the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been the\r\n      leader of all these movements—as the figurehead of a ship may seem\r\n      to a savage to guide the vessel—acted like a child who, holding a\r\n      couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it."

This little\r\n      dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside Karatáev at night; it sometimes\r\n      made excursions into the town but always returned again. Probably it had\r\n      never had an owner, and it still belonged to nobody and had no name.

Its lack of a\r\n      master, a name, or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to\r\n      trouble the blue-gray dog in the least. Its furry tail stood up firm and\r\n      round as a plume, its bandy legs served it so well that it would often\r\n      gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three legs,\r\n      as if disdaining to use all four. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll\r\n      on its back, yelping with delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful\r\n      air of importance, and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a\r\n      straw.\nPierre’s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only remnant\r\n      of his former clothing), a pair of soldier’s trousers which by Karatáev’s\r\n      advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and a peasant coat\r\n      and cap. Physically he had changed much during this time. He no longer\r\n      seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength\r\n      hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache covered the lower part of\r\n      his face, and a tangle of hair, infested with lice, curled round his head\r\n      like a cap. The look of his eyes was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert,\r\n      as never before. The former slackness which had shown itself even in his\r\n      eyes was now replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance.\r\n      His feet were bare.\nPierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen were\r\n      passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then at the\r\n      dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him, and then at his\r\n      bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various positions, moving his\r\n      dirty thick big toes. Every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of\r\n      animated self-satisfaction flitted across his face. The sight of them\r\n      reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and\r\n      this recollection was pleasant to him.\nFor some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in\r\n      the mornings—what is called an “old wives’ summer.”\nIn the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly\r\n      pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in the\r\n      air.\nOn everything—far and near—lay the magic crystal glitter seen\r\n      only at that time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the\r\n      distance, with the village, the church, and the large white house. The\r\n      bare trees, the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church\r\n      spire, and the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out\r\n      in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural\r\n      clearness. Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned\r\n      mansion occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green\r\n      beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled house—which in\r\n      dull weather was repulsively ugly—seemed quietly beautiful now, in\r\n      the clear, motionless brilliance.\nA French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on his\r\n      head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of the shed\r\n      and approached Pierre with a friendly wink.\n“What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!” (Their name for Pierre.) “Eh?\r\n      Just like spring!”\nAnd the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe,\r\n      though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.\n“To be on the march in such weather...” he began.\nPierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told\r\n      him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an\r\n      order about the prisoners that day. Sokolóv, one of the soldiers in the\r\n      shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something\r\n      should be done about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not worry\r\n      about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and\r\n      arrangements would be made for the sick, and that in general everything\r\n      that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities.\n“Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain, you\r\n      know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to the captain when he\r\n      makes his round, he will do anything for you.”\n(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre\r\n      and showed him all sorts of favors.)\n“‘You see, St. Thomas,’ he said to me the other day. ‘Monsieur Kiril is a\r\n      man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has had\r\n      misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what’s what.... If he wants\r\n      anything and asks me, he won’t get a refusal. When one has studied, you\r\n      see, one likes education and well-bred people.’ It is for your sake I\r\n      mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you that\r\n      affair would have ended ill.”\nAnd after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair he\r\n      had alluded to had happened a few days before—a fight between the\r\n      prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in\r\n      pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre\r\n      talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said.\r\n      While Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving\r\n      Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of the\r\n      shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of\r\n      greeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had\r\n      given a shirt to sew was in that shed.\nA week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them,\r\n      which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts\r\n      for them.\n“Ready, ready, dear fellow!” said Karatáev, coming out with a neatly\r\n      folded shirt.\nKaratáev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work, was\r\n      wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His hair was\r\n      bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast, and his round\r\n      face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.\n“A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is,\r\n      ready,” said Platón, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.\nThe Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his\r\n      hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had a\r\n      long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare body,\r\n      but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh\r\n      at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None of the\r\n      prisoners said a word.\n“See, it fits well!” Platón kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.\nThe Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without raising\r\n      his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.\n“You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper tools;\r\n      and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,” said Platón with\r\n      one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his work.\n“It’s good, quite good, thank you,” said the Frenchman, in French, “but\r\n      there must be some linen left over.”\n“It will fit better still when it sets to your body,” said Karatáev, still\r\n      admiring his handiwork. “You’ll be nice and comfortable....”\n“Thanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?” said the\r\n      Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note and gave\r\n      it to Karatáev. “But give me the pieces that are over.”\nPierre saw that Platón did not want to understand what the Frenchman was\r\n      saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karatáev thanked the\r\n      Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The Frenchman\r\n      insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked\r\n      Pierre to translate what he said.\n“What does he want the bits for?” said Karatáev. “They’d make fine leg\r\n      bands for us. Well, never mind.”\nAnd Karatáev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took a\r\n      small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the Frenchman\r\n      without looking at him. “Oh dear!” muttered Karatáev and went away. The\r\n      Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then looked\r\n      inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre’s look had told him something,\r\n      suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:\n“Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!” And handing back the odd\r\n      bits he turned and went out.\n“There, look at that,” said Karatáev, swaying his head. “People said they\r\n      were not Christians, but they too have souls. It’s what the old folk used\r\n      to say: ‘A sweating hand’s an open hand, a dry hand’s close.’ He’s naked,\r\n      but yet he’s given it back.”\nKaratáev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces.\n“But they’ll make grand leg bands, dear friend,” he said, and went back\r\n      into the shed."

    "text": "Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though the\r\n      French had offered to move him from the men’s to the officers’ shed, he\r\n      had stayed in the shed where he was first put.\nIn burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme\r\n      limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical strength\r\n      and health, of which he had till then been unconscious, and thanks\r\n      especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was\r\n      impossible to say when they began, he endured his position not only\r\n      lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he obtained the tranquillity\r\n      and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach. He had long\r\n      sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind, that inner harmony\r\n      which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of Borodinó. He\r\n      had sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the dissipations of town\r\n      life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and in romantic love for\r\n      Natásha; he had sought it by reasoning—and all these quests and\r\n      experiments had failed him. And now without thinking about it he had found\r\n      that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death, through\r\n      privation, and through what he recognized in Karatáev.\nThose dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it\r\n      were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating\r\n      thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did not\r\n      now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or Napoleon.\r\n      It was plain to him that all these things were no business of his, and\r\n      that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not\r\n      do so. “Russia and summer weather are not bound together,” he thought,\r\n      repeating words of Karatáev’s which he found strangely consoling. His\r\n      intention of killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic\r\n      number of the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and\r\n      even ridiculous. His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should\r\n      not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing. What\r\n      concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the\r\n      life she preferred? What did it matter to anybody, and especially to him,\r\n      whether or not they found out that their prisoner’s name was Count\r\n      Bezúkhov?\nHe now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite\r\n      agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew’s thoughts somewhat\r\n      differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could only\r\n      be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as\r\n      though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is\r\n      implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre\r\n      believed it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering, the\r\n      satisfaction of one’s needs and consequent freedom in the choice of one’s\r\n      occupation, that is, of one’s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be\r\n      indubitably man’s highest happiness. Here and now for the first time he\r\n      fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat, drinking\r\n      when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of warmth when\r\n      he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk and to hear\r\n      a human voice. The satisfaction of one’s needs—good food,\r\n      cleanliness, and freedom—now that he was deprived of all this,\r\n      seemed to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice of\r\n      occupation, that is, of his way of life—now that that was so\r\n      restricted—seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a\r\n      superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying one’s\r\n      needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupation—such freedom\r\n      as his wealth, his education, and his social position had given him in his\r\n      own life—is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly\r\n      difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation.\nAll Pierre’s daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free. Yet\r\n      subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke with\r\n      enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable, strong,\r\n      joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner\r\n      freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.\nWhen on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and\r\n      saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark at\r\n      first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the wooded\r\n      banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance, when he\r\n      felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying\r\n      from Moscow across the field, and when afterwards light gleamed from the\r\n      east and the sun’s rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud, and the\r\n      cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the river, all began\r\n      to sparkle in the glad light—Pierre felt a new joy and strength in\r\n      life such as he had never before known. And this not only stayed with him\r\n      during the whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in strength as the\r\n      hardships of his position increased.\nThat feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still further\r\n      strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of him\r\n      soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge of languages, the\r\n      respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his readiness to give\r\n      anything asked of him (he received the allowance of three rubles a week\r\n      made to officers); with his strength, which he showed to the soldiers by\r\n      pressing nails into the walls of the hut; his gentleness to his\r\n      companions, and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing\r\n      anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible), he appeared to them a\r\n      rather mysterious and superior being. The very qualities that had been a\r\n      hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in the world he had lived in—his\r\n      strength, his disdain for the comforts of life, his absent-mindedness and\r\n      simplicity—here among these people gave him almost the status of a\r\n      hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him."

    "text": "The French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh of\r\n      October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts loaded, and troops and\r\n      baggage trains started.\nAt seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing shakos\r\n      and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in front of the\r\n      sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses sounded all along the\r\n      lines.\nIn the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only awaited\r\n      the order to start. The sick soldier, Sokolóv, pale and thin with dark\r\n      shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed.\r\n      His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly at\r\n      his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned regularly\r\n      and quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him\r\n      to moan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being left alone.\nPierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karatáev had\r\n      made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest\r\n      and brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and\r\n      squatted down beside him.\n“You know, Sokolóv, they are not all going away! They have a hospital\r\n      here. You may be better off than we others,” said Pierre.\n“O Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!” moaned the man in a\r\n      louder voice.\n“I’ll go and ask them again directly,” said Pierre, rising and going to\r\n      the door of the shed.\nJust as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him a pipe\r\n      the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal and soldiers\r\n      were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal straps, and\r\n      these changed their familiar faces.\nThe corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The prisoners\r\n      had to be counted before being let out.\n“Corporal, what will they do with the sick man?...” Pierre began.\nBut even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he\r\n      knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that\r\n      moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was\r\n      suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierre’s words\r\n      and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed became\r\n      semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick\r\n      man’s groans.\n“There it is!...Itagain!...” said Pierre to himself, and an involuntary\r\n      shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal’s changed face, in the sound\r\n      of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums, he\r\n      recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled people against\r\n      their will to kill their fellow men—that force the effect of which\r\n      he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to try to escape that\r\n      force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its\r\n      tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait and endure. He\r\n      did not again go to the sick man, nor turn to look at him, but stood\r\n      frowning by the door of the hut.\nWhen that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one another\r\n      like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed his way\r\n      forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured\r\n      him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also in marching\r\n      kit, and on his cold face appeared that sameitwhich Pierre had\r\n      recognized in the corporal’s words and in the roll of the drums.\n“Pass on, pass on!” the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and looking\r\n      at the prisoners who thronged past him.\nPierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.\n“What now?” the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing\r\n      Pierre.\nPierre told him about the sick man.\n“He’ll manage to walk, devil take him!” said the captain. “Pass on, pass\r\n      on!” he continued without looking at Pierre.\n“But he is dying,” Pierre again began.\n“Be so good...” shouted the captain, frowning angrily.\n“Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...”rattled the drums, and Pierre\r\n      understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that\r\n      it was now useless to say any more.\nThe officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march\r\n      in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and\r\n      about three hundred men.\nThe officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to\r\n      Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his\r\n      shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major\r\n      with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a Kazán dressing gown\r\n      tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his\r\n      fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco pouch,\r\n      inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly\r\n      with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and growled at\r\n      everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all\r\n      hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at\r\n      something when there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin\r\n      little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now\r\n      being taken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt boots\r\n      and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed\r\n      at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations as to what had\r\n      been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they\r\n      could see. A third officer, who by his accent was a Pole, disputed with\r\n      the commissariat officer, arguing that he was mistaken in his\r\n      identification of the different wards of Moscow.\n“What are you disputing about?” said the major angrily. “What does it\r\n      matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it’s burned\r\n      down, and there’s an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn’t the\r\n      road wide enough?” said he, turning to a man behind him who was not\r\n      pushing him at all.\n“Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?” the prisoners on one side and another\r\n      were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. “All beyond the\r\n      river, and Zúbova, and in the Krémlin.... Just look! There’s not half of\r\n      it left. Yes, I told you—the whole quarter beyond the river, and so\r\n      it is.”\n“Well, you know it’s burned, so what’s the use of talking?” said the\r\n      major.\nAs they passed near a church in the Khamóvniki (one of the few unburned\r\n      quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one\r\n      side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.\n“Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And smeared\r\n      with something!”\nPierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these\r\n      exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings\r\n      surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better than\r\n      he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright against the\r\n      palings with its face smeared with soot.\n“Go on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...” the convoy\r\n      guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence, drove\r\n      away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead\r\n      man."

    "text": "Through the cross streets of the Khamóvniki quarter the prisoners marched,\r\n      followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to\r\n      that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they came among a\r\n      huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with private vehicles.\nAt the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across.\r\n      From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains\r\n      before and behind them. To the right, where the Kalúga road turns near\r\n      Neskúchny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the\r\n      distance. These were troops of Beauharnais’ corps which had started before\r\n      any of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the Stone\r\n      Bridge, were Ney’s troops and transport.\nDavout’s troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the\r\n      Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kalúga road. But\r\n      the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais’ train\r\n      had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kalúga road when the\r\n      vanguard of Ney’s army was already emerging from the Great Ordýnka Street.\nWhen they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps\r\n      forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men\r\n      crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred paces\r\n      that separated the bridge from the Kalúga road, taking more than an hour\r\n      to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the\r\n      Transmoskvá ward and the Kalúga road converge, and the prisoners jammed\r\n      close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From all\r\n      sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the\r\n      tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood\r\n      pressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise which\r\n      mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums.\nTo get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of\r\n      the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.\n“What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They’ve loaded goods even on the\r\n      cannon! Look there, those are furs!” they exclaimed. “Just see what the\r\n      blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one has behind in the\r\n      cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by heaven!... Oh,\r\n      the rascals!... See how that fellow has loaded himself up, he can hardly\r\n      walk! Good lord, they’ve even grabbed those chaises!... See that fellow\r\n      there sitting on the trunks.... Heavens! They’re fighting.”\n“That’s right, hit him on the snout—on his snout! Like this, we\r\n      shan’t get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be\r\n      Napoleon’s own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! It’s\r\n      like a portable house.... That fellow’s dropped his sack and doesn’t\r\n      see it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either! Yes, I\r\n      dare say, that’s the way they’ll let you pass.... Just look,\r\n      there’s no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven, so they are! In\r\n      carriages—see how comfortably they’ve settled themselves!”\nAgain, as at the church in Khamóvniki, a wave of general curiosity bore\r\n      all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to his\r\n      stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their\r\n      curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely\r\n      squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring colors,\r\n      who were shouting something in shrill voices.\nFrom the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious\r\n      force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse\r\n      smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned\r\n      ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on\r\n      him—as if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to\r\n      receive impressions that might weaken it.\nThe women’s vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers,\r\n      wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts,\r\n      more soldiers, and now and then women.\nPierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.\nAll these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power.\r\n      During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from the\r\n      different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly; they all\r\n      jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white teeth\r\n      gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from side to\r\n      side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly\r\n      cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the corporal’s\r\n      face when the drums were beating.\nIt was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort\r\n      collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the\r\n      baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged onto\r\n      the Kalúga road.\nThey marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the sun\r\n      began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men began\r\n      to prepare for their night’s rest. They all appeared angry and\r\n      dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could be\r\n      heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran into one of\r\n      the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several soldiers ran\r\n      toward the cart from different sides: some beat the carriage horses on\r\n      their heads, turning them aside, others fought among themselves, and\r\n      Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head by a sword.\nIt seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid fields in the\r\n      chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and the same feeling of\r\n      unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had\r\n      seized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all seemed to\r\n      understand that they did not yet know where they were going, and that much\r\n      that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey.\nDuring this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had\r\n      done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the first time\r\n      received horseflesh for their meat ration.\nFrom the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like\r\n      personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to\r\n      their former friendly relations.\nThis spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of\r\n      prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian\r\n      soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw a\r\n      Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the\r\n      road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to\r\n      court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the\r\n      Russian. To the noncommissioned officer’s excuse that the prisoner was ill\r\n      and could not walk, the officer replied that the order was to shoot those\r\n      who lagged behind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him\r\n      during the executions, but which he had not felt during his imprisonment,\r\n      now again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but he felt that in\r\n      proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him, there grew and\r\n      strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it.\nHe ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his\r\n      comrades.\nNeither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in\r\n      Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of the\r\n      order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in reaction\r\n      against the worsening of their position they were all particularly\r\n      animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing scenes\r\n      they had witnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of their\r\n      present situation.\nThe sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in the\r\n      sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the\r\n      rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray\r\n      haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night had not yet\r\n      come. Pierre got up and left his new companions, crossing between the\r\n      campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common\r\n      soldier prisoners were stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On the road\r\n      he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.\nPierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an\r\n      unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and\r\n      dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart\r\n      and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he burst\r\n      out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that men from\r\n      various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently\r\n      solitary laughter could mean.\n“Ha-ha-ha!” laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: “The soldier did\r\n      not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me captive. What,\r\n      me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...” and he laughed till\r\n      tears started to his eyes.\nA man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at\r\n      all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther away from\r\n      the inquisitive man, and looked around him.\nThe huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling\r\n      of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the red campfires\r\n      were growing paler and dying down. High up in the light sky hung the full\r\n      moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, unseen before, were now visible\r\n      in the distance. And farther still, beyond those forests and fields, the\r\n      bright, oscillating, limitless distance lured one to itself. Pierre\r\n      glanced up at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths. “And\r\n      all that is me, all that is within me, and it is all I!” thought Pierre.\r\n      “And they caught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks!”\r\n       He smiled, and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions."

    "text": "In the early days of October another envoy came to Kutúzov with a letter\r\n      from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though\r\n      Napoleon was already not far from Kutúzov on the old Kalúga road. Kutúzov\r\n      replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by\r\n      Lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.\nSoon after that a report was received from Dórokhov’s guerrilla detachment\r\n      operating to the left of Tarútino that troops of Broussier’s division had\r\n      been seen at Formínsk and that being separated from the rest of the French\r\n      army they might easily be destroyed. The soldiers and officers again\r\n      demanded action. Generals on the staff, excited by the memory of the easy\r\n      victory at Tarútino, urged Kutúzov to carry out Dórokhov’s suggestion.\r\n      Kutúzov did not consider any offensive necessary. The result was a\r\n      compromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was sent to Formínsk\r\n      to attack Broussier.\nBy a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most\r\n      difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhtúrov—that same\r\n      modest little Dokhtúrov whom no one had described to us as drawing up\r\n      plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses\r\n      on batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as\r\n      undecided and undiscerning—but whom we find commanding wherever the\r\n      position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from\r\n      Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the Augezd\r\n      dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all were flying\r\n      and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard. Ill\r\n      with fever he went to Smolénsk with twenty thousand men to defend the town\r\n      against Napoleon’s whole army. In Smolénsk, at the Malákhov Gate, he had\r\n      hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the\r\n      bombardment of the town—and Smolénsk held out all day long. At the\r\n      battle of Borodinó, when Bagratión was killed and nine tenths of the men\r\n      of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the French artillery\r\n      fire was directed against it, the man sent there was this same irresolute\r\n      and undiscerning Dokhtúrov—Kutúzov hastening to rectify a mistake he\r\n      had made by sending someone else there first. And the quiet little\r\n      Dokhtúrov rode thither, and Borodinó became the greatest glory of the\r\n      Russian army. Many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose,\r\n      but of Dokhtúrov scarcely a word has been said.\nIt was Dokhtúrov again whom they sent to Formínsk and from there to\r\n      Málo-Yaroslávets, the place where the last battle with the French was\r\n      fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began; and\r\n      we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign,\r\n      but of Dokhtúrov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously. And\r\n      this silence about Dokhtúrov is the clearest testimony to his merit.\nIt is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a machine\r\n      to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is\r\n      interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important\r\n      part. The man who does not understand the construction of the machine\r\n      cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly\r\n      is one of the most essential parts of the machine, and not the shaving\r\n      which merely harms and hinders the working.\nOn the tenth of October when Dokhtúrov had gone halfway to Formínsk and\r\n      stopped at the village of Aristóvo, preparing faithfully to execute the\r\n      orders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive\r\n      movement, reached Murat’s position apparently in order to give battle—suddenly\r\n      without any reason turned off to the left onto the new Kalúga road and\r\n      began to enter Formínsk, where only Broussier had been till then. At that\r\n      time Dokhtúrov had under his command, besides Dórokhov’s detachment, the\r\n      two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Seslávin.\nOn the evening of October 11 Seslávin came to the Aristóvo headquarters\r\n      with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the troops\r\n      that had entered Formínsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army,\r\n      that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four days\r\n      previously. That same evening a house serf who had come from Bórovsk said\r\n      he had seen an immense army entering the town. Some Cossacks of\r\n      Dokhtúrov’s detachment reported having sighted the French Guards marching\r\n      along the road to Bórovsk. From all these reports it was evident that\r\n      where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole\r\n      French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected direction—along\r\n      the Kalúga road. Dokhtúrov was unwilling to undertake any action, as it\r\n      was not clear to him now what he ought to do. He had been ordered to\r\n      attack Formínsk. But only Broussier had been there at that time and now\r\n      the whole French army was there. Ermólov wished to act on his own\r\n      judgment, but Dokhtúrov insisted that he must have Kutúzov’s instructions.\r\n      So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff.\nFor this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovítinov, was chosen, who was to\r\n      explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering a written\r\n      report. Toward midnight Bolkhovítinov, having received the dispatch and\r\n      verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff accompanied by a\r\n      Cossack with spare horses."

    "text": "It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four days.\r\n      Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a\r\n      half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovítinov reached Litashëvka after one\r\n      o’clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a\r\n      signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered a dark\r\n      passage.\n“The general on duty, quick! It’s very important!” said he to someone who\r\n      had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.\n“He has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he\r\n      has not slept,” said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. “You should wake\r\n      the captain first.”\n“But this is very important, from General Dokhtúrov,” said Bolkhovítinov,\r\n      entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark.\nThe orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.\n“Your honor, your honor! A courier.”\n“What? What’s that? From whom?” came a sleepy voice.\n“From Dokhtúrov and from Alexéy Petróvich. Napoleon is at Formínsk,” said\r\n      Bolkhovítinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by\r\n      the voice that it was not Konovnítsyn.\nThe man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.\n“I don’t like waking him,” he said, fumbling for something. “He is very\r\n      ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.”\n“Here is the dispatch,” said Bolkhovítinov. “My orders are to give it at\r\n      once to the general on duty.”\n“Wait a moment, I’ll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you\r\n      always hide it?” said the voice of the man who was stretching himself, to\r\n      the orderly. (This was Shcherbínin, Konovnítsyn’s adjutant.) “I’ve found\r\n      it, I’ve found it!” he added.\nThe orderly was striking a light and Shcherbínin was fumbling for\r\n      something on the candlestick.\n“Oh, the nasty beasts!” said he with disgust.\nBy the light of the sparks Bolkhovítinov saw Shcherbínin’s youthful face\r\n      as he held the candle, and the face of another man who was still asleep.\r\n      This was Konovnítsyn.\nWhen the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up,\r\n      first blue and then red, Shcherbínin lit the tallow candle, from the\r\n      candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running\r\n      away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhovítinov was bespattered all over\r\n      with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.\n“Who gave the report?” inquired Shcherbínin, taking the envelope.\n“The news is reliable,” said Bolkhovítinov. “Prisoners, Cossacks,\r\n      and the scouts all say the same thing.”\n“There’s nothing to be done, we’ll have to wake him,” said Shcherbínin,\r\n      rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a\r\n      greatcoat. “Peter Petróvich!” said he. (Konovnítsyn did not stir.) “To the\r\n      General Staff!” he said with a smile, knowing that those words would be\r\n      sure to arouse him.\nAnd in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On Konovnítsyn’s\r\n      handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever, there still remained\r\n      for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs,\r\n      but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and\r\n      firm appearance.\n“Well, what is it? From whom?” he asked immediately but without hurry,\r\n      blinking at the light.\nWhile listening to the officer’s report Konovnítsyn broke the seal and\r\n      read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in\r\n      their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his\r\n      boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair over his temples,\r\n      and donned his cap.\n“Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.”\nKonovnítsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great\r\n      importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or ask\r\n      himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest him. He\r\n      regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his\r\n      reason but by something else. There was within him a deep unexpressed\r\n      conviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this and\r\n      still less speak about it, but must only attend to one’s own work. And he\r\n      did his work, giving his whole strength to the task.\nPeter Petróvich Konovnítsyn, like Dokhtúrov, seems to have been included\r\n      merely for propriety’s sake in the list of the so-called heroes of 1812—the\r\n      Barclays, Raévskis, Ermólovs, Plátovs, and Milorádoviches. Like Dokhtúrov\r\n      he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and\r\n      information, and like Dokhtúrov he never made plans of battle but was\r\n      always found where the situation was most difficult. Since his appointment\r\n      as general on duty he had always slept with his door open, giving orders\r\n      that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up. In battle he was\r\n      always under fire, so that Kutúzov reproved him for it and feared to send\r\n      him to the front, and like Dokhtúrov he was one of those unnoticed\r\n      cogwheels that, without clatter or noise, constitute the most essential\r\n      part of the machine.\nComing out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnítsyn frowned—partly\r\n      from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought\r\n      that occurred to him, of how all that nest of influential men on the staff\r\n      would be stirred up by this news, especially Bennigsen, who ever since\r\n      Tarútino had been at daggers drawn with Kutúzov; and how they would make\r\n      suggestions, quarrel, issue orders, and rescind them. And this premonition\r\n      was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped.\nAnd in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news, immediately\r\n      began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters, until\r\n      Konovnítsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded him that they must go\r\n      to see his Highness."

    "text": "Kutúzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often fell\r\n      asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed without\r\n      undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.\nSo he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on his\r\n      plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the\r\n      darkness.\nSince Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more influence\r\n      than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, Kutúzov was more at\r\n      ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take\r\n      part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the Tarútino battle\r\n      and of the day before it, which Kutúzov remembered with pain, must, he\r\n      thought, have some effect on others too.\n“They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.\r\n      Patience and time are my warriors, my champions,” thought Kutúzov. He knew\r\n      that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall of\r\n      itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree is\r\n      harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman he\r\n      knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole strength of\r\n      Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally wounded or not\r\n      was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of Lauriston and\r\n      Barthélemi having been sent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, Kutúzov\r\n      was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he needed further proofs\r\n      and it was necessary to wait.\n“They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall see!\r\n      Continual maneuvers, continual advances!” thought he. “What for? Only to\r\n      distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are like children\r\n      from whom one can’t get any sensible account of what has happened because\r\n      they all want to show how well they can fight. But that’s not what is\r\n      needed now.\n“And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to them\r\n      that when they have thought of two or three contingencies” (he remembered\r\n      the general plan sent him from Petersburg) “they have foreseen everything.\r\n      But the contingencies are endless.”\nThe undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodinó was\r\n      mortal or not had hung over Kutúzov’s head for a whole month. On the one\r\n      hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kutúzov felt assured\r\n      with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the\r\n      Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal. But in any\r\n      case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew\r\n      more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those\r\n      sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for\r\n      doing. He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like the\r\n      younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of\r\n      contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. The\r\n      longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. He imagined\r\n      all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or in sections—against\r\n      Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him. He thought too of the\r\n      possibility (which he feared most of all) that Napoleon might fight him\r\n      with his own weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. Kutúzov even\r\n      imagined that Napoleon’s army might turn back through Medýn and Yukhnóv,\r\n      but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened—the insane,\r\n      convulsive stampede of Napoleon’s army during its first eleven days after\r\n      leaving Moscow: a stampede which made possible what Kutúzov had not yet\r\n      even dared to think of—the complete extermination of the French.\r\n      Dórokhov’s report about Broussier’s division, the guerrillas’ reports of\r\n      distress in Napoleon’s army, rumors of preparations for leaving Moscow,\r\n      all confirmed the supposition that the French army was beaten and\r\n      preparing for flight. But these were only suppositions, which seemed\r\n      important to the younger men but not to Kutúzov. With his sixty years’\r\n      experience he knew what value to attach to rumors, knew how apt people who\r\n      desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what\r\n      they desire, and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that\r\n      makes for the contrary. And the more he desired it the less he allowed\r\n      himself to believe it. This question absorbed all his mental powers. All\r\n      else was to him only life’s customary routine. To such customary routine\r\n      belonged his conversations with the staff, the letters he wrote from\r\n      Tarútino to Madame de Staël, the reading of novels, the distribution of\r\n      awards, his correspondence with Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction\r\n      of the French, which he alone foresaw, was his heart’s one desire.\nOn the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm and\r\n      thinking of that.\nThere was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,\r\n      Konovnítsyn, and Bolkhovítinov.\n“Eh, who’s there? Come in, come in! What news?” the field marshal called\r\n      out to them.\nWhile a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the substance of\r\n      the news.\n“Who brought it?” asked Kutúzov with a look which, when the candle was\r\n      lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.\n“There can be no doubt about it, your Highness.”\n“Call him in, call him here.”\nKutúzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch\r\n      resting against the other which was doubled under him. He screwed up his\r\n      seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to\r\n      read in his face what preoccupied his own mind.\n“Tell me, tell me, friend,” said he to Bolkhovítinov in his low, aged\r\n      voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest,\r\n      “come nearer—nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That\r\n      Napoleon has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?”\nBolkhovítinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had\r\n      been told to report.\n“Speak quicker, quicker! Don’t torture me!” Kutúzov interrupted him.\nBolkhovítinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting\r\n      instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kutúzov checked him.\r\n      He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled; he\r\n      waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side of the room, to the\r\n      corner darkened by the icons that hung there.\n“O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...” said he in a tremulous\r\n      voice with folded hands. “Russia is saved. I thank Thee, O Lord!” and he\r\n      wept."

    "text": "From the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all\r\n      Kutúzov’s activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by\r\n      authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks, maneuvers, or\r\n      encounters with the perishing enemy. Dokhtúrov went to Málo-Yaroslávets,\r\n      but Kutúzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for the evacuation\r\n      of Kalúga—a retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible.\nEverywhere Kutúzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for his\r\n      retreat fled in the opposite direction.\nNapoleon’s historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at Tarútino and\r\n      Málo-Yaroslávets, and make conjectures as to what would have happened had\r\n      Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern provinces.\nBut not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing\r\n      into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did not bar his way),\r\n      the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army, for then\r\n      already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin. How could that\r\n      army—which had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had trampled\r\n      them underfoot instead of keeping them, and on arriving at Smolénsk had\r\n      looted provisions instead of storing them—how could that army\r\n      recuperate in Kalúga province, which was inhabited by Russians such as\r\n      those who lived in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of\r\n      consuming what was set ablaze?\nThat army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of Borodinó and the\r\n      pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the chemical\r\n      elements of dissolution.\nThe members of what had once been an army—Napoleon himself and all\r\n      his soldiers—fled without knowing whither, each concerned only to\r\n      make his escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the\r\n      hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.\nSo it came about that at the council at Málo-Yaroslávets, when the\r\n      generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all\r\n      mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier\r\n      Mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing\r\n      needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not even\r\n      Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all recognized.\nBut though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there\r\n      still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee. An\r\n      external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in\r\n      due time. It was what the French called“le hourra de l’Empereur.”\nThe day after the council at Málo-Yaroslávets Napoleon rode out early in\r\n      the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an\r\n      escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the\r\n      previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks on the prowl for booty\r\n      fell in with the Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the Cossacks did\r\n      not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very thing that was\r\n      destroying the French army, the booty on which the Cossacks fell. Here as\r\n      at Tarútino they went after plunder, leaving the men. Disregarding\r\n      Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon managed to escape.\nWhenles enfants du Donmight so easily have taken the Emperor himself in\r\n      the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but to\r\n      fly as fast as possible along the nearest, familiar road. Napoleon with\r\n      his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his former\r\n      agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright the Cossacks\r\n      had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued orders—as the\r\n      historians tell us—to retreat by the Smolénsk road.\nThat Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, does not\r\n      prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which\r\n      influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozháysk (that is, the\r\n      Smolénsk) road acted simultaneously on him also."

    "text": "A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to go a\r\n      thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end\r\n      of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a promised land to\r\n      have the strength to move.\nThe promised land for the French during their advance had been Moscow,\r\n      during their retreat it was their native land. But that native land was\r\n      too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely\r\n      necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself: “Today I\r\n      shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and spend\r\n      the night,” and during the first day’s journey that resting place eclipses\r\n      his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires. And the impulses\r\n      felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.\nFor the French retreating along the old Smolénsk road, the final goal—their\r\n      native land—was too remote, and their immediate goal was Smolénsk,\r\n      toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously intensified in the\r\n      mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that much food and fresh\r\n      troops awaited them in Smolénsk, nor that they were told so (on the\r\n      contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself, knew that\r\n      provisions were scarce there), but because this alone could give them\r\n      strength to move on and endure their present privations. So both those who\r\n      knew and those who did not know deceived themselves, and pushed on to\r\n      Smolénsk as to a promised land.\nComing out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy and\r\n      unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. Besides the common\r\n      impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and supplied\r\n      them with a certain energy, there was another cause binding them together—their\r\n      great numbers. As with the physical law of gravity, their enormous mass\r\n      drew the individual human atoms to itself. In their hundreds of thousands\r\n      they moved like a whole nation.\nEach of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to\r\n      escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one hand the force of\r\n      this common attraction to Smolénsk, their goal, drew each of them in the\r\n      same direction; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a\r\n      company, and though the French availed themselves of every convenient\r\n      opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent\r\n      pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. Their very numbers and their\r\n      crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered\r\n      it not only difficult but impossible for the Russians to stop this\r\n      movement, to which the French were directing all their energies. Beyond a\r\n      certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the\r\n      process of decomposition.\nA lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a certain limit\r\n      of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow. On the\r\n      contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow\r\n      becomes.\nOf the Russian commanders Kutúzov alone understood this. When the flight\r\n      of the French army along the Smolénsk road became well defined, what\r\n      Konovnítsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began to\r\n      occur. The superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves, to cut\r\n      off, to seize, to capture, and to overthrow the French, and all clamored\r\n      for action.\nKutúzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited in the\r\n      case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.\nHe could not tell them what we say now: “Why fight, why block the road,\r\n      losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches? What\r\n      is the use of that, when a third of their army has melted away on the road\r\n      from Moscow to Vyázma without any battle?” But drawing from his aged\r\n      wisdom what they could understand, he told them of the golden bridge, and\r\n      they laughed at and slandered him, flinging themselves on, rending and\r\n      exulting over the dying beast.\nErmólov, Milorádovich, Plátov, and others in proximity to the French near\r\n      Vyázma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two French\r\n      corps, and by way of reporting their intention to Kutúzov they sent him a\r\n      blank sheet of paper in an envelope.\nAnd try as Kutúzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked, trying\r\n      to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to the attack\r\n      with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost thousands of men.\nBut they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army, closing\r\n      up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily melting away, to\r\n      pursue its fatal path to Smolénsk."

    "text": "The Battle of Borodinó, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it and\r\n      the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the most\r\n      instructive phenomena in history.\nAll historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in\r\n      their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a\r\n      direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of\r\n      states and nations increases or decreases.\nStrange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor,\r\n      having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemy’s army,\r\n      gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and\r\n      subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all the\r\n      facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the statement\r\n      that the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the\r\n      cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or decrease in\r\n      the strength of the nation—even though it is unintelligible why the\r\n      defeat of an army—a hundredth part of a nation—should oblige\r\n      that whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the\r\n      rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the\r\n      defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its\r\n      rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army\r\n      suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.\nSo according to history it has been found from the most ancient times, and\r\n      so it is to our own day. All Napoleon’s wars serve to confirm this rule.\r\n      In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses its rights,\r\n      and the rights and the strength of France increase. The victories of the\r\n      French at Jena and Auerstädt destroy the independent existence of Prussia.\nBut then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is taken\r\n      and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that ceases to\r\n      exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and then Napoleonic\r\n      France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of history: to say\r\n      that the field of battle at Borodinó remained in the hands of the\r\n      Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles that destroyed\r\n      Napoleon’s army, is impossible.\nAfter the French victory at Borodinó there was no general engagement nor\r\n      any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What\r\n      does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China, we\r\n      might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the historians’\r\n      usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards); if the matter\r\n      concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took\r\n      part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event occurred before\r\n      our fathers’ eyes, and for them it was a question of the life or death of\r\n      their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of all known wars.\nThe period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodinó to the\r\n      expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not\r\n      produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest;\r\n      it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the\r\n      conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.\nThe French historians, describing the condition of the French army before\r\n      it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army, except the\r\n      cavalry, the artillery, and the transport—there was no forage for\r\n      the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy, for\r\n      the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the French\r\n      have it.\nThe victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants\r\n      Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their\r\n      carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest\r\n      any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such\r\n      peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered\r\n      them, but burned it instead.\nLet us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers\r\n      according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has gone on\r\n      for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself wounded and\r\n      understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life, throws\r\n      down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to\r\n      brandish it. Then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly\r\n      employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same\r\n      time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the\r\n      facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier\r\n      according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what confusion and\r\n      obscurity would result from such an account of the duel.\nThe fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was\r\n      the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up\r\n      the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter\r\n      according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described\r\n      the event.\nAfter the burning of Smolénsk a war began which did not follow any\r\n      previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the\r\n      retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodinó and the renewed\r\n      retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of\r\n      transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.\nNapoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing\r\n      attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent’s rapier saw a cudgel\r\n      raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kutúzov and to the\r\n      Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the\r\n      rules—as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the\r\n      complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in spite of\r\n      the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather disgraceful\r\n      to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a poseen quarteoren\r\n      tierceaccording to all the rules, and to make an adroit thrusten prime,\r\n      and so on—the cudgel of the people’s war was lifted with all its\r\n      menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting anyone’s tastes or\r\n      rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and fell with stupid\r\n      simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French till the whole\r\n      invasion had perished.\nAnd it is well for a people who do not—as the French did in 1813—salute\r\n      according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their\r\n      rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror,\r\n      but at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have adopted\r\n      in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to\r\n      hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in\r\n      their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion."

    "text": "One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called\r\n      laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together\r\n      in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that take on a national\r\n      character. In such actions, instead of two crowds opposing each other, the\r\n      men disperse, attack singly, run away when attacked by stronger forces,\r\n      but again attack when opportunity offers. This was done by the guerrillas\r\n      in Spain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and by the Russians in\r\n      1812.\nPeople have called this kind of war “guerrilla warfare” and assume that by\r\n      so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does not fit\r\n      in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule of tactics\r\n      which is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an attacker should\r\n      concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his opponent at the\r\n      moment of conflict.\nGuerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes\r\n      that rule.\nThis contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the\r\n      strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military science\r\n      says that the more troops the greater the strength.Les gros bataillons\r\n      ont toujours raison. *\n* Large battalions are always victorious.\nFor military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by\r\n      reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal to\r\n      each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.\nMomentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.\nIn military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and\r\n      some unknownx.\nMilitary science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that\r\n      the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small\r\n      detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence of this\r\n      unknown factor and tries to discover it—now in a geometric\r\n      formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the\r\n      genius of the commanders. But the assignment of these various meanings to\r\n      the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts.\nYet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify the\r\n      “heroes”) of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by\r\n      commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.\nThat unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the\r\n      greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men\r\n      composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are not,\r\n      fighting under the command of a genius, in two—or three-line\r\n      formation, with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute.\r\n      Men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous\r\n      conditions for fighting.\nThe spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the\r\n      resulting force. To define and express the significance of this unknown\r\n      factor—the spirit of an army—is a problem for science.\nThis problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for\r\n      the unknownxitself the conditions under which that force becomes\r\n      apparent—such as the commands of the general, the equipment\r\n      employed, and so on—mistaking these for the real significance of the\r\n      factor, and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being\r\n      the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only then,\r\n      expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative\r\n      significance of this factor, can we hope to define the unknown.\nTen men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, or\r\n      divisions, conquer—that is, kill or take captive—all the\r\n      others, while themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and on\r\n      the other fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to the\r\n      fifteen, and therefore 4x= 15y. Consequentlyx/y= 15/4.\r\n      This equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio\r\n      between two unknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units\r\n      (battles, campaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of\r\n      numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be\r\n      discovered.\nThe tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and in\r\n      smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the\r\n      strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under fire\r\n      more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed than is\r\n      needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of account the\r\n      spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly\r\n      striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit\r\n      of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.\nThe French, retreating in 1812—though according to tactics they\r\n      should have separated into detachments to defend themselves—congregated\r\n      into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the\r\n      mass held the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought\r\n      according to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up\r\n      into small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate\r\n      individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing any\r\n      compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers."

    "text": "The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into\r\n      Smolénsk.\nBefore partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government,\r\n      thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had been destroyed\r\n      by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off as instinctively as\r\n      dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Denís Davýdov, with his Russian\r\n      instinct, was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel\r\n      which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the French,\r\n      and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward\r\n      regularizing this method of warfare.\nOn August 24 Davýdov’s first partisan detachment was formed and then\r\n      others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more\r\n      numerous these detachments became.\nThe irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the\r\n      fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree—the\r\n      French army—and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when\r\n      the French were fleeing toward Smolénsk, there were hundreds of such\r\n      companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted\r\n      all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the comforts\r\n      of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were also small\r\n      scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and landowners\r\n      that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which captured\r\n      several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there was\r\n      Vasílisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of the French.\nThe partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of\r\n      October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,\r\n      amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded and\r\n      captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling, hardly\r\n      daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the end of\r\n      October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become clear\r\n      to all what could be ventured against the French and what could not. Now\r\n      only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and moving according to\r\n      rules at a distance from the French, still regarded many things as\r\n      impossible. The small bands that had started their activities long before\r\n      and had already observed the French closely considered things possible\r\n      which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate.\r\n      The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the French now considered\r\n      everything possible.\nOn October 22, Denísov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his group\r\n      at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning he and his\r\n      party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching from the\r\n      forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of cavalry baggage\r\n      and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army, which—as\r\n      was learned from spies and prisoners—was moving under a strong\r\n      escort to Smolénsk. Besides Denísov and Dólokhov (who also led a small\r\n      party and moved in Denísov’s vicinity), the commanders of some large\r\n      divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and, as Denísov expressed\r\n      it, were sharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders of large\r\n      parties—one a Pole and the other a German—sent invitations to\r\n      Denísov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with their\r\n      divisions to attack the convoy.\n“No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,” said Denísov on reading\r\n      these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his heartfelt\r\n      desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to forgo\r\n      that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish\r\n      general. To the Polish general he replied to the same effect, informing\r\n      him that he was already under the command of the German.\nHaving arranged matters thus, Denísov and Dólokhov intended, without\r\n      reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that convoy\r\n      with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from the village\r\n      of Mikúlino to that of Shámshevo. To the left of the road between Mikúlino\r\n      and Shámshevo there were large forests, extending in some places up to the\r\n      road itself though in others a mile or more back from it. Through these\r\n      forests Denísov and his party rode all day, sometimes keeping well back in\r\n      them and sometimes coming to the very edge, but never losing sight of the\r\n      moving French. That morning, Cossacks of Denísov’s party had seized and\r\n      carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which\r\n      had stuck in the mud not far from Mikúlino where the forest ran close to\r\n      the road. Since then, and until evening, the party had watched the\r\n      movements of the French without attacking. It was necessary to let the\r\n      French reach Shámshevo quietly without alarming them and then, after\r\n      joining Dólokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a\r\n      watchman’s hut in the forest less than a mile from Shámshevo, to surprise\r\n      the French at dawn, falling like an avalanche on their heads from two\r\n      sides, and rout and capture them all at one blow.\nIn their rear, more than a mile from Mikúlino where the forest came right\r\n      up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of\r\n      French should show themselves.\nBeyond Shámshevo, Dólokhov was to observe the road in the same way, to\r\n      find out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned\r\n      that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Denísov had two hundred, and\r\n      Dólokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not\r\n      deter Denísov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were\r\n      and to learn that he had to capture a “tongue”—that is, a man from\r\n      the enemy column. That morning’s attack on the wagons had been made so\r\n      hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a\r\n      little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he\r\n      could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column.\nDenísov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of\r\n      putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent Tíkhon Shcherbáty, a\r\n      peasant of his party, to Shámshevo to try and seize at least one of the\r\n      French quartermasters who had been sent on in advance."

    "text": "It was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both the\r\n      color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then suddenly\r\n      heavy slanting rain came down.\nDenísov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down\r\n      was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse,\r\n      which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving\r\n      rain and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick\r\n      black beard looked angry.\nBeside Denísov rode anesaul, * Denísov’s fellow worker, also\r\n      in felt cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.\n* A captain of Cossacks.\nEsaul Lováyski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,\r\n      pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm\r\n      self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to say\r\n      in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first glance at\r\n      theesauland Denísov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable\r\n      and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at theesaulone saw that\r\n      he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a\r\n      man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was one with his horse, a being\r\n      consequently possessed of twofold strength.\nA little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and wearing\r\n      a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.\nA little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghíz mount with an enormous\r\n      tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue French\r\n      overcoat.\nBeside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and\r\n      blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the\r\n      hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with\r\n      surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.\nBehind them along the narrow, sodden, cut up forest road came hussars in\r\n      threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French\r\n      greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses, being\r\n      drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay. Their\r\n      necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely thin. Steam\r\n      rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet, slippery, and\r\n      sodden, like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road. The\r\n      men sat huddled up trying not to stir, so as to warm the water that had\r\n      trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was\r\n      leaking in under their seats, their knees, and at the back of their necks.\r\n      In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two wagons, drawn by French\r\n      horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had been hitched on in front,\r\n      rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water\r\n      that lay in the ruts.\nDenísov’s horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his\r\n      rider’s knee against a tree.\n“Oh, the devil!” exclaimed Denísov angrily, and showing his teeth he\r\n      struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his\r\n      comrades with mud.\nDenísov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger\r\n      (none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he\r\n      still had no news from Dólokhov and the man sent to capture a “tongue” had\r\n      not returned.\n“There’ll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today.\r\n      It’s too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till\r\n      another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey from\r\n      under our noses,” thought Denísov, continually peering forward, hoping to\r\n      see a messenger from Dólokhov.\nOn coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the\r\n      right, Denísov stopped.\n“There’s someone coming,” said he.\nTheesaullooked in the direction Denísov indicated.\n“There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is notpresupposablethat it is the lieutenant colonel himself,” said theesaul, who was\r\n      fond of using words the Cossacks did not know.\nThe approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer visible,\r\n      but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary gallop and\r\n      using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and drenched, whose\r\n      trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him, standing in the\r\n      stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young lad with a broad\r\n      rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Denísov and handed him a\r\n      sodden envelope.\n“From the general,” said the officer. “Please excuse its\r\n      not being quite dry.”\nDenísov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.\n“There, they kept telling us: ‘It’s dangerous, it’s\r\n      dangerous,’” said the officer, addressing theesaulwhile\r\n      Denísov was reading the dispatch. “But Komaróv and I”—he pointed\r\n      to the Cossack—“were prepared. We have each of us two pistols.... But\r\n      what’s this?” he asked, noticing the French drummer boy. “A\r\n      prisoner? You’ve already been in action? May I speak to him?”\n“Wostóv! Pétya!” exclaimed Denísov, having run through the\r\n      dispatch. “Why didn’t you say who you were?” and turning with a\r\n      smile he held out his hand to the lad.\nThe officer was Pétya Rostóv.\nAll the way Pétya had been preparing himself to behave with Denísov as\r\n      befitted a grown-up man and an officer—without hinting at their\r\n      previous acquaintance. But as soon as Denísov smiled at him Pétya\r\n      brightened up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had\r\n      been rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already been in a battle\r\n      near Vyázma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there.\n“Well, I am glad to see you,” Denísov interrupted him, and his face again\r\n      assumed its anxious expression.\n“Michael Feoklítych,” said he to theesaul, “this is\r\n      again fwom that German, you know. He”—he indicated\r\n      Pétya—“is serving under him.”\nAnd Denísov told theesaulthat the dispatch just delivered was a\r\n      repetition of the German general’s demand that he should join forces with\r\n      him for an attack on the transport.\n“If we don’t take it tomowwow, he’ll snatch it fwom under our noses,” he\r\n      added.\nWhile Denísov was talking to theesaul, Pétya—abashed by Denísov’s\r\n      cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers—furtively\r\n      tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one should notice\r\n      it, while maintaining as martial an air as possible.\n“Will there be any orders, your honor?” he asked Denísov, holding his hand\r\n      at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he\r\n      had prepared himself, “or shall I remain with your honor?”\n“Orders?” Denísov repeated thoughtfully. “But can you stay till tomowwow?”\n“Oh, please... May I stay with you?” cried Pétya.\n“But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?” asked\r\n      Denísov.\nPétya blushed.\n“He gave me no instructions. I think I could?” he returned, inquiringly.\n“Well, all wight,” said Denísov.\nAnd turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place\r\n      arranged near the watchman’s hut in the forest, and told the officer on\r\n      the Kirghíz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and find\r\n      out where Dólokhov was and whether he would come that evening. Denísov\r\n      himself intended going with theesauland Pétya to the edge of the forest\r\n      where it reached out to Shámshevo, to have a look at the part of the\r\n      French bivouac they were to attack next day.\n“Well, old fellow,” said he to the peasant guide, “lead us to Shámshevo.”\nDenísov, Pétya, and theesaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the hussar\r\n      who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the\r\n      forest."

    "text": "The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from the\r\n      trees. Denísov, theesaul, and Pétya rode silently, following the peasant\r\n      in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving\r\n      noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves, silently led\r\n      them to the edge of the forest.\nHe ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to where\r\n      the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that had\r\n      not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with\r\n      his hand.\nDenísov and Pétya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was\r\n      standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a\r\n      downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep\r\n      ravine, was a small village and a landowner’s house with a broken roof. In\r\n      the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well, by the pond, over\r\n      all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill from the bridge\r\n      leading to the village, not more than five hundred yards away, crowds of\r\n      men could be seen through the shimmering mist. Their un-Russian shouting\r\n      at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts, and their\r\n      calls to one another, could be clearly heard.\n“Bwing the prisoner here,” said Denísov in a low voice, not taking his\r\n      eyes off the French.\nA Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to Denísov.\r\n      Pointing to the French troops, Denísov asked him what these and those of\r\n      them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting\r\n      his eyebrows, looked at Denísov in affright, but in spite of an evident\r\n      desire to say all he knew gave confused answers, merely assenting to\r\n      everything Denísov asked him. Denísov turned away from him frowning and\r\n      addressed theesaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.\nPétya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now at\r\n      Denísov, now at theesaul, and now at the French in the village and along\r\n      the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.\n“Whether Dólokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?” said Denísov with a\r\n      merry sparkle in his eyes.\n“It is a very suitable spot,” said theesaul.\n“We’ll send the infantwy down by the swamps,” Denísov continued. “They’ll\r\n      cweep up to the garden; you’ll wide up fwom there with the Cossacks”—he\r\n      pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village—“and I with my\r\n      hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...”\n“The hollow is impassable—there’s a swamp there,” said theesaul.\r\n      “The horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....”\nWhile they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from the\r\n      low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then another, and\r\n      the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices shouting together\r\n      came up from the slope. For a moment Denísov and theesauldrew back. They\r\n      were so near that they thought they were the cause of the firing and\r\n      shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate to them. Down below,\r\n      a man wearing something red was running through the marsh. The French were\r\n      evidently firing and shouting at him.\n“Why, that’s our Tíkhon,” said theesaul.\n“So it is! It is!”\n“The wascal!” said Denísov.\n“He’ll get away!” said theesaul, screwing up his eyes.\nThe man whom they called Tíkhon, having run to the stream, plunged in so\r\n      that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an\r\n      instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on.\r\n      The French who had been pursuing him stopped.\n“Smart, that!” said theesaul.\n“What a beast!” said Denísov with his former look of vexation. “What has\r\n      he been doing all this time?”\n“Who is he?” asked Pétya.\n“He’s ourplastún. I sent him to capture a ‘tongue.’”\n“Oh, yes,” said Pétya, nodding at the first words Denísov uttered as if he\r\n      understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of it.\nTíkhon Shcherbáty was one of the most indispensable men in their band. He\r\n      was a peasant from Pokróvsk, near the river Gzhat. When Denísov had come\r\n      to Pokróvsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual summoned\r\n      the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French, the elder,\r\n      as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village elders did, that\r\n      he had neither seen nor heard anything of them. But when Denísov explained\r\n      that his purpose was to kill the French, and asked if no French had\r\n      strayed that way, the elder replied that some “more-orderers” had really\r\n      been at their village, but that Tíkhon Shcherbáty was the only man who\r\n      dealt with such matters. Denísov had Tíkhon called and, having praised him\r\n      for his activity, said a few words in the elder’s presence about loyalty\r\n      to the Tsar and the country and the hatred of the French that all sons of\r\n      the fatherland should cherish.\n“We don’t do the French any harm,” said Tíkhon, evidently frightened by\r\n      Denísov’s words. “We only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know! We\r\n      killed a score or so of ‘more-orderers,’ but we did no harm else....”\nNext day when Denísov had left Pokróvsk, having quite forgotten about this\r\n      peasant, it was reported to him that Tíkhon had attached himself to their\r\n      party and asked to be allowed to remain with it. Denísov gave orders to\r\n      let him do so.\nTíkhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water,\r\n      flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude\r\n      for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always\r\n      brought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring in\r\n      French captives also. Denísov then relieved him from drudgery and began\r\n      taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled\r\n      among the Cossacks.\nTíkhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging behind\r\n      the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried rather as a\r\n      joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth,\r\n      with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones.\r\n      Tíkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arm’s length, or\r\n      holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons. In\r\n      Denísov’s party he held a peculiar and exceptional position. When anything\r\n      particularly difficult or nasty had to be done—to push a cart out of\r\n      the mud with one’s shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail,\r\n      skin it, slink in among the French, or walk more than thirty miles in a\r\n      day—everybody pointed laughingly at Tíkhon.\n“It won’t hurt that devil—he’s as strong as a horse!” they said of\r\n      him.\nOnce a Frenchman Tíkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and\r\n      shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which Tíkhon treated\r\n      only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the subject of\r\n      the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment—jokes in which Tíkhon\r\n      readily joined.\n“Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?” the Cossacks would banter\r\n      him. And Tíkhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to be\r\n      angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect of\r\n      this incident on Tíkhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in\r\n      prisoners.\nHe was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more\r\n      opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen, and\r\n      consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and\r\n      willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by Denísov overnight to\r\n      Shámshevo to capture a “tongue.” But whether because he had not been\r\n      content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept through the\r\n      night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the French and, as\r\n      Denísov had witnessed from above, had been detected by them."

    "text": "After talking for some time with theesaulabout next day’s attack, which\r\n      now, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have definitely\r\n      decided on, Denísov turned his horse and rode back.\n“Now, my lad, we’ll go and get dwy,” he said to Pétya.\nAs they approached the watchhouse Denísov stopped, peering into the\r\n      forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,\r\n      wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazán hat, was approaching with\r\n      long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in\r\n      his girdle. When he espied Denísov he hastily threw something into the\r\n      bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and approached his\r\n      commander. It was Tíkhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow\r\n      little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He lifted his head high\r\n      and gazed at Denísov as if repressing a laugh.\n“Well, where did you disappear to?” inquired Denísov.\n“Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,” answered Tíkhon\r\n      boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.\n“Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why\r\n      haven’t you taken one?”\n“Oh, I took one all right,” said Tíkhon.\n“Where is he?”\n“You see, I took him first thing at dawn,” Tíkhon continued, spreading out\r\n      his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. “I took him into\r\n      the forest. Then I see he’s no good and think I’ll go and fetch a likelier\r\n      one.”\n“You see?... What a wogue—it’s just as I thought,” said Denísov to\r\n      theesaul. “Why didn’t you bwing that one?”\n“What was the good of bringing him?” Tíkhon interrupted hastily and\r\n      angrily—“that one wouldn’t have done for you. As if I don’t know\r\n      what sort you want!”\n“What a bwute you are!... Well?”\n“I went for another one,” Tíkhon continued, “and I crept like this through\r\n      the wood and lay down.” (He suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple\r\n      movement to show how he had done it.) “One turned up and I grabbed him,\r\n      like this.” (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) “‘Come along to the\r\n      colonel,’ I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there were four of them.\r\n      They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went for them with my ax,\r\n      this way: ‘What are you up to?’ says I. ‘Christ be with you!’” shouted\r\n      Tíkhon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest.\n“Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the\r\n      puddles!” said theesaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.\nPétya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained from\r\n      laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tíkhon’s face to theesaul’sand Denísov’s, unable to make out what it all meant.\n“Don’t play the fool!” said Denísov, coughing angrily. “Why didn’t you\r\n      bwing the first one?”\nTíkhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other, then\r\n      suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin, disclosing\r\n      a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called Shcherbáty—the\r\n      gap-toothed). Denísov smiled, and Pétya burst into a peal of merry\r\n      laughter in which Tíkhon himself joined.\n“Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,” said Tíkhon. “The clothes on\r\n      him—poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why,\r\n      he says: ‘I’m a general’s son myself, I won’t go!’ he says.”\n“You are a bwute!” said Denísov. “I wanted to question...”\n“But I questioned him,” said Tíkhon. “He said he didn’t know much. ‘There\r\n      are a lot of us,’ he says, ‘but all poor stuff—only soldiers in\r\n      name,’ he says. ‘Shout loud at them,’ he says, ‘and you’ll take them\r\n      all,’” Tíkhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into Denísov’s\r\n      eyes.\n“I’ll give you a hundwed sharp lashes—that’ll teach you to play the\r\n      fool!” said Denísov severely.\n“But why are you angry?” remonstrated Tíkhon, “just as if I’d never seen\r\n      your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I’ll fetch you any of them\r\n      you want—three if you like.”\n“Well, let’s go,” said Denísov, and rode all the way to the watchhouse in\r\n      silence and frowning angrily.\nTíkhon followed behind and Pétya heard the Cossacks laughing with him and\r\n      at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes.\nWhen the fit of laughter that had seized him at Tíkhon’s words and smile\r\n      had passed and Pétya realized for a moment that this Tíkhon had killed a\r\n      man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a\r\n      pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a moment. He felt it\r\n      necessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question theesaulwith an air of importance about tomorrow’s undertaking, that he\r\n      might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.\nThe officer who had been sent to inquire met Denísov on the way with the\r\n      news that Dólokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.\nDenísov at once cheered up and, calling Pétya to him, said: “Well, tell me\r\n      about yourself.”"

    "text": "Pétya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined\r\n      his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large\r\n      guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission, and\r\n      especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the\r\n      battle of Vyázma, Pétya had been in a constant state of blissful\r\n      excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss\r\n      any chance to do something really heroic. He was highly delighted with\r\n      what he saw and experienced in the army, but at the same time it always\r\n      seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just\r\n      where he did not happen to be. And he was always in a hurry to get where\r\n      he was not.\nWhen on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send\r\n      somebody to Denísov’s detachment, Pétya begged so piteously to be sent\r\n      that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled\r\n      Pétya’s mad action at the battle of Vyázma, where instead of riding by the\r\n      road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the\r\n      advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired his\r\n      pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any\r\n      action whatever of Denísov’s. That was why Pétya had blushed and grown\r\n      confused when Denísov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had\r\n      ridden to the outskirts of the forest Pétya had considered he must carry\r\n      out his instructions strictly and return at once. But when he saw the\r\n      French and saw Tíkhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack\r\n      that night, he decided, with the rapidity with which young people change\r\n      their views, that the general, whom he had greatly respected till then,\r\n      was a rubbishy German, that Denísov was a hero, theesaula hero, and\r\n      Tíkhon a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at\r\n      a moment of difficulty.\nIt was already growing dusk when Denísov, Pétya, and theesaulrode up to\r\n      the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, and Cossacks\r\n      and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were\r\n      kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French could\r\n      not see the smoke. In the passage of the small watchhouse a Cossack with\r\n      sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. In the room three officers of\r\n      Denísov’s band were converting a door into a tabletop. Pétya took off his\r\n      wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and at once began helping the officers\r\n      to fix up the dinner table.\nIn ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the table\r\n      were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.\nSitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with\r\n      his hands, down which the grease trickled, Pétya was in an ecstatic\r\n      childish state of love for all men, and consequently of confidence that\r\n      others loved him in the same way.\n“So then what do you think, Vasíli Dmítrich?” said he to Denísov. “It’s\r\n      all right my staying a day with you?” And not waiting for a reply he\r\n      answered his own question: “You see I was told to find out—well, I\r\n      am finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the chief... I\r\n      don’t want a reward.... But I want...”\nPétya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head and\r\n      flourishing his arms.\n“Into the vewy chief...” Denísov repeated with a smile.\n“Only, please let me command something, so that I may really command...”\r\n       Pétya went on. “What would it be to you?... Oh, you want a knife?” he\r\n      said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton.\nAnd he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.\n“Please keep it. I have several like it,” said Pétya, blushing. “Heavens!\r\n      I was quite forgetting!” he suddenly cried. “I have some raisins, fine\r\n      ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and he has such\r\n      capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something sweet. Would\r\n      you like some?...” and Pétya ran out into the passage to his Cossack and\r\n      brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins. “Have\r\n      some, gentlemen, have some!”\n“You want a coffeepot, don’t you?” he asked theesaul. “I bought a capital\r\n      one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And he’s very honest, that’s\r\n      the chief thing. I’ll be sure to send it to you. Or perhaps your flints\r\n      are giving out, or are worn out—that happens sometimes, you know. I\r\n      have brought some with me, here they are”—and he showed a bag—“a\r\n      hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please take as many as you want,\r\n      or all if you like....”\nThen suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, Pétya stopped and\r\n      blushed.\nHe tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was\r\n      foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered the French\r\n      drummer boy. “It’s capital for us here, but what of him? Where have they\r\n      put him? Have they fed him? Haven’t they hurt his feelings?” he thought.\r\n      But having caught himself saying too much about the flints, he was now\r\n      afraid to speak out.\n“I might ask,” he thought, “but they’ll say: ‘He’s a boy himself and so he\r\n      pities the boy.’ I’ll show them tomorrow whether I’m a boy. Will it seem\r\n      odd if I ask?” Pétya thought. “Well, never mind!” and immediately,\r\n      blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared\r\n      ironical, he said:\n“May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to\r\n      eat?... Perhaps...”\n“Yes, he’s a poor little fellow,” said Denísov, who evidently saw nothing\r\n      shameful in this reminder. “Call him in. His name is Vincent Bosse. Have\r\n      him fetched.”\n“I’ll call him,” said Pétya.\n“Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,” Denísov repeated.\nPétya was standing at the door when Denísov said this. He slipped in\r\n      between the officers, came close to Denísov, and said:\n“Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!”\nAnd having kissed Denísov he ran out of the hut.\n“Bosse! Vincent!” Pétya cried, stopping outside the door.\n“Who do you want, sir?” asked a voice in the darkness.\nPétya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that\r\n      day.\n“Ah, Vesénny?” said a Cossack.\nVincent, the boy’s name, had already been changed by the Cossacks intoVesénny(vernal) and intoVesényaby the peasants and soldiers. In both\r\n      these adaptations the reference to spring (vesná) matched the impression\r\n      made by the young lad.\n“He is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Vesénya! Vesénya!—Vesénny!”\r\n       laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness.\n“He’s a smart lad,” said an hussar standing near Pétya. “We gave him\r\n      something to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!”\nThe sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the\r\n      darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.\n“Ah, c’est vous!”said Pétya.“Voulez-vous\r\n      manger? N’ayez pas peur, on ne vous fera pas de mal,”* he added\r\n      shyly and affectionately, touching the boy’s hand.“Entrez, entrez.”*(2)\n* “Ah, it’s you! Do you want something to eat? Don’t be\r\n     afraid, they won’t hurt you.”\n* (2) “Come in, come in.”\n“Merci, monsieur,”* said the drummer boy in a trembling\r\n      almost childish voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.\n* “Thank you, sir.”\nThere were many things Pétya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did not\r\n      dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in the\r\n      darkness he took the boy’s hand and pressed it.\n“Come in, come in!” he repeated in a gentle whisper. “Oh, what can I do\r\n      for him?” he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.\nWhen the boy had entered the hut, Pétya sat down at a distance from him,\r\n      considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. But he\r\n      fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem\r\n      ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy."

    "text": "The arrival of Dólokhov diverted Pétya’s attention from the drummer boy,\r\n      to whom Denísov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had\r\n      dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not\r\n      sent away with the other prisoners. Pétya had heard in the army many\r\n      stories of Dólokhov’s extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the\r\n      French, so from the moment he entered the hut Pétya did not take his eyes\r\n      from him, but braced himself up more and more and held his head high, that\r\n      he might not be unworthy even of such company.\nDólokhov’s appearance amazed Pétya by its simplicity.\nDenísov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas the\r\n      Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and everything he did\r\n      indicated his unusual position. But Dólokhov, who in Moscow had worn a\r\n      Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the\r\n      Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman’s padded coat with an\r\n      Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight\r\n      on his head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room, and\r\n      without greeting anyone went up to Denísov and began questioning him about\r\n      the matter in hand. Denísov told him of the designs the large detachments\r\n      had on the transport, of the message Pétya had brought, and his own\r\n      replies to both generals. Then he told him all he knew of the French\r\n      detachment.\n“That’s so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,” said\r\n      Dólokhov. “It will be necessary to go there. We can’t start the affair\r\n      without knowing for certain how many there are. I like to work accurately.\r\n      Here now—wouldn’t one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the\r\n      French camp with me? I have brought a spare uniform.”\n“I, I... I’ll go with you!” cried Pétya.\n“There’s no need for you to go at all,” said Denísov, addressing Dólokhov,\r\n      “and as for him, I won’t let him go on any account.”\n“I like that!” exclaimed Pétya. “Why shouldn’t I go?”\n“Because it’s useless.”\n“Well, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and that’s\r\n      all. You’ll take me, won’t you?” he said, turning to Dólokhov.\n“Why not?” Dólokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of the French\r\n      drummer boy. “Have you had that youngster with you long?” he asked\r\n      Denísov.\n“He was taken today but he knows nothing. I’m keeping him with me.”\n“Yes, and where do you put the others?” inquired Dólokhov.\n“Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,” shouted Denísov,\r\n      suddenly flushing. “And I say boldly that I have not a single man’s life\r\n      on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee\r\n      hundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining—I speak\r\n      bluntly—staining the honor of a soldier?”\n“That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of\r\n      sixteen,” said Dólokhov with cold irony, “but it’s time for you to drop\r\n      it.”\n“Why, I’ve not said anything! I only say that I’ll certainly go with you,”\r\n       said Pétya shyly.\n“But for you and me, old fellow, it’s time to drop these amenities,”\r\n       continued Dólokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this\r\n      subject which irritated Denísov. “Now, why have you kept this lad?” he\r\n      went on, swaying his head. “Because you are sorry for him! Don’t we know\r\n      those ‘receipts’ of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty get\r\n      there. The rest either starve or get killed. So isn’t it all the same not\r\n      to send them?”\nTheesaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.\n“That’s not the point. I’m not going to discuss the matter. I do not wish\r\n      to take it on my conscience. You say they’ll die. All wight. Only not by\r\n      my fault!”\nDólokhov began laughing.\n“Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if they\r\n      did catch me they’d string me up to an aspen tree, and with all your\r\n      chivalry just the same.” He paused. “However, we must get to work. Tell\r\n      the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms in it. Well, are\r\n      you coming with me?” he asked Pétya.\n“I? Yes, yes, certainly!” cried Pétya, blushing almost to tears and\r\n      glancing at Denísov.\nWhile Dólokhov had been disputing with Denísov what should be done with\r\n      prisoners, Pétya had once more felt awkward and restless; but again he had\r\n      no time to grasp fully what they were talking about. “If grown-up,\r\n      distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and right,” thought he.\r\n      “But above all Denísov must not dare to imagine that I’ll obey him and\r\n      that he can order me about. I will certainly go to the French camp with\r\n      Dólokhov. If he can, so can I!”\nAnd to all Denísov’s persuasions, Pétya replied that he too was accustomed\r\n      to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that he never\r\n      considered personal danger.\n“For you’ll admit that if we don’t know for sure how many of them there\r\n      are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two of us.\r\n      Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so don’t hinder\r\n      me,” said he. “It will only make things worse....”"

    "text": "Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, Pétya and Dólokhov rode to the\r\n      clearing from which Denísov had reconnoitered the French camp, and\r\n      emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow.\r\n      On reaching the bottom, Dólokhov told the Cossacks accompanying him to\r\n      await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge.\r\n      Pétya, his heart in his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.\n“If we’re caught, I won’t be taken alive! I have a pistol,” whispered he.\n“Don’t talk Russian,” said Dólokhov in a hurried whisper, and at that very\r\n      moment they heard through the darkness the challenge:“Qui vive?”* and\r\n      the click of a musket.\n* “Who goes there?”\nThe blood rushed to Pétya’s face and he grasped his pistol.\n“Lanciers du 6-me,”* replied Dólokhov, neither hastening nor slackening\r\n      his horse’s pace.\n* “Lancers of the 6th Regiment.”\nThe black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.\n“Mot d’ordre.”*\n* “Password.”\nDólokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.\n“Dites donc, le colonel Gérard est ici?”* he asked.\n* “Tell me, is Colonel Gérard here?”\n“Mot d’ordre,”repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.\n“Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot\r\n      d’ordre...”cried Dólokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight\r\n      at the sentinel.“Je vous demande si le colonel est ici.”*\n* “When an officer is making his round, sentinels don’t ask\r\n     him for the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is\r\n     here.”\nAnd without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped\r\n      aside, Dólokhov rode up the incline at a walk.\nNoticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dólokhov stopped\r\n      him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man, a soldier\r\n      with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to Dólokhov’s horse,\r\n      touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in a friendly way that\r\n      the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the\r\n      courtyard of the farm, as he called the landowner’s house.\nHaving ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be\r\n      heard around the campfires, Dólokhov turned into the courtyard of the\r\n      landowner’s house. Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a big\r\n      blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily. Something\r\n      was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a\r\n      peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was kneeling beside it\r\n      stirring its contents with a ramrod.\n“Oh, he’s a hard nut to crack,” said one of the officers who was sitting\r\n      in the shadow at the other side of the fire.\n“He’ll make them get a move on, those fellows!” said another, laughing.\nBoth fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of\r\n      Dólokhov’s and Pétya’s steps as they advanced to the fire leading their\r\n      horses.\n“Bonjour, messieurs!”* said Dólokhov loudly and clearly.\n* “Good day, gentlemen.”\nThere was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire, and one\r\n      tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up to Dólokhov.\n“Is that you, Clément?” he asked. “Where the devil...?”\r\n      But, noticing his mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted Dólokhov\r\n      as a stranger, asking what he could do for him.\nDólokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their\r\n      regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew\r\n      anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and Pétya\r\n      thought the officers were beginning to look at him and Dólokhov with\r\n      hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.\n“If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late,” said a\r\n      voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.\nDólokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that\r\n      night.\nHe handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and\r\n      squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long\r\n      neck. That officer did not take his eyes from Dólokhov and again asked to\r\n      what regiment he belonged. Dólokhov, as if he had not heard the question,\r\n      did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took from his\r\n      pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe\r\n      from Cossacks.\n“Those brigands are everywhere,” replied an officer from behind the fire.\nDólokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such\r\n      as his companion and himself, “but probably they would not dare to attack\r\n      large detachments?” he added inquiringly. No one replied.\n“Well, now he’ll come away,” Pétya thought every moment as he stood by the\r\n      campfire listening to the talk.\nBut Dólokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began\r\n      putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion,\r\n      how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about the Russian\r\n      prisoners with that detachment, Dólokhov said:\n“A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would be\r\n      better to shoot such rabble,” and burst into loud laughter, so strange\r\n      that Pétya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise, and\r\n      involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.\nNo one replied a word to Dólokhov’s laughter, and a French officer whom\r\n      they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered\r\n      something to a companion. Dólokhov got up and called to the soldier who\r\n      was holding their horses.\n“Will they bring our horses or not?” thought Pétya, instinctively drawing\r\n      nearer to Dólokhov.\nThe horses were brought.\n“Good evening, gentlemen,” said Dólokhov.\nPétya wished to say “Good night” but could not utter a word. The officers\r\n      were whispering together. Dólokhov was a long time mounting his horse\r\n      which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a footpace.\r\n      Pétya rode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or not the\r\n      French were running after them, but not daring to.\nComing out onto the road Dólokhov did not ride back across the open\r\n      country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and listened. “Do\r\n      you hear?” he asked. Pétya recognized the sound of Russian voices and saw\r\n      the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires. When they had\r\n      descended to the bridge Pétya and Dólokhov rode past the sentinel, who\r\n      without saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then they descended\r\n      into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.\n“Well now, good-by. Tell Denísov, ‘at the first shot at daybreak,’” said\r\n      Dólokhov and was about to ride away, but Pétya seized hold of him.\n“Really!” he cried, “you are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid! How\r\n      I love you!”\n“All right, all right!” said Dólokhov. But Pétya did not let go of him and\r\n      Dólokhov saw through the gloom that Pétya was bending toward him and\r\n      wanted to kiss him. Dólokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and\r\n      vanished into the darkness."

    "text": "Having returned to the watchman’s hut, Pétya found Denísov in the passage.\r\n      He was awaiting Pétya’s return in a state of agitation, anxiety, and\r\n      self-reproach for having let him go.\n“Thank God!” he exclaimed. “Yes, thank God!” he repeated,\r\n      listening to Pétya’s rapturous account. “But, devil take you, I\r\n      haven’t slept because of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still\r\n      get a nap before morning.”\n“But... no,” said Pétya, “I don’t want to sleep yet. Besides I know\r\n      myself, if I fall asleep it’s finished. And then I am used to not sleeping\r\n      before a battle.”\nHe sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition\r\n      and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day.\nThen, noticing that Denísov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.\nIt was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were still\r\n      falling from the trees. Near the watchman’s hut the black shapes of the\r\n      Cossacks’ shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen. Behind\r\n      the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them\r\n      were discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red. Not\r\n      all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the sounds\r\n      of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be heard\r\n      low voices which seemed to be whispering.\nPétya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.\r\n      Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses\r\n      munching their oats. In the dark Pétya recognized his own horse, which he\r\n      called “Karabákh” though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.\n“Well, Karabákh! We’ll do some service tomorrow,” said he, sniffing its\r\n      nostrils and kissing it.\n“Why aren’t you asleep, sir?” said a Cossack who was sitting under a\r\n      wagon.\n“No, ah... Likhachëv—isn’t that your name? Do you know I have only\r\n      just come back! We’ve been into the French camp.”\nAnd Pétya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but\r\n      also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life than\r\n      to act “just anyhow.”\n“Well, you should get some sleep now,” said the Cossack.\n“No, I am used to this,” said Pétya. “I say, aren’t the flints in your\r\n      pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Don’t you want any? You can have\r\n      some.”\nThe Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at\r\n      Pétya.\n“Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,” said Pétya.\r\n      “Some fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and then they’re\r\n      sorry for it afterwards. I don’t like that.”\n“Just so,” said the Cossack.\n“Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my saber\r\n      for me? It’s got bl...” (Pétya feared to tell a lie, and the saber never\r\n      had been sharpened.) “Can you do it?”\n“Of course I can.”\nLikhachëv got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon Pétya heard the warlike\r\n      sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its\r\n      edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.\n“I say! Are the lads asleep?” asked Pétya.\n“Some are, and some aren’t—like us.”\n“Well, and that boy?”\n“Vesénny? Oh, he’s thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast asleep\r\n      after his fright. He was that glad!”\nAfter that Pétya remained silent for a long time, listening to the sounds.\r\n      He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.\n“What are you sharpening?” asked a man coming up to the wagon.\n“Why, this gentleman’s saber.”\n“That’s right,” said the man, whom Pétya took to be an\r\n      hussar. “Was the cup left here?”\n“There, by the wheel!”\nThe hussar took the cup.\n“It must be daylight soon,” said he, yawning, and went away.\nPétya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denísov’s guerrilla\r\n      band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon captured from the\r\n      French beside which horses were tethered, that under it Likhachëv was\r\n      sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark blotch to the right\r\n      was the watchman’s hut, and the red blotch below to the left was the dying\r\n      embers of a campfire, that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar\r\n      who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all\r\n      this. He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality. The big\r\n      dark blotch might really be the watchman’s hut or it might be a cavern\r\n      leading to the very depths of the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire,\r\n      or it might be the eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was really\r\n      sitting on a wagon, but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a\r\n      wagon but on a terribly high tower from which, if he fell, he would have\r\n      to fall for a whole day or a whole month, or go on falling and never reach\r\n      the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cossack, Likhachëv, who was sitting\r\n      under the wagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful,\r\n      most splendid man in the world, whom no one knew of. It might really have\r\n      been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow, but\r\n      perhaps he had simply vanished—disappeared altogether and dissolved\r\n      into nothingness.\nNothing Pétya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in a\r\n      fairy kingdom where everything was possible.\nHe looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth. It\r\n      was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing\r\n      as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds were\r\n      passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as if the\r\n      black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high, high\r\n      overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with\r\n      one’s hand.\nPétya’s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.\nThe trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and\r\n      jostled one another. Someone snored.\n“Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...”hissed the saber against the whetstone, and\r\n      suddenly Pétya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown, sweetly\r\n      solemn hymn. Pétya was as musical as Natásha and more so than Nicholas,\r\n      but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the melody that\r\n      unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and\r\n      attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody grew and\r\n      passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was a fugue—though\r\n      Pétya had not the least conception of what a fugue is. Each instrument—now\r\n      resembling a violin and now a horn, but better and clearer than violin or\r\n      horn—played its own part, and before it had finished the melody\r\n      merged with another instrument that began almost the same air, and then\r\n      with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into one and again became\r\n      separate and again blended, now into solemn church music, now into\r\n      something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.\n“Oh—why, that was in a dream!” Pétya said to himself, as he lurched\r\n      forward. “It’s in my ears. But perhaps it’s music of my own. Well, go on,\r\n      my music! Now!...”\nHe closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, sounds\r\n      fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again all mingled\r\n      into the same sweet and solemn hymn. “Oh, this is delightful! As much as I\r\n      like and as I like!” said Pétya to himself. He tried to conduct that\r\n      enormous orchestra.\n“Now softly, softly die away!” and the sounds obeyed him. “Now fuller,\r\n      more joyful. Still more and more joyful!” And from an unknown depth rose\r\n      increasingly triumphant sounds. “Now voices join in!” ordered Pétya. And\r\n      at first from afar he heard men’s voices and then women’s. The voices grew\r\n      in harmonious triumphant strength, and Pétya listened to their surpassing\r\n      beauty in awe and joy.\nWith a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the\r\n      trees, and the hissing of the saber,“Ozheg-zheg-zheg...”and again the horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the choir\r\n      but joining in it.\nPétya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the time,\r\n      wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it.\r\n      He was awakened by Likhachëv’s kindly voice.\n“It’s ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!”\nPétya woke up.\n“It’s getting light, it’s really getting light!” he exclaimed.\nThe horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their\r\n      very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches.\r\n      Pétya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it\r\n      to Likhachëv; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed it.\r\n      The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths.\n“And here’s the commander,” said Likhachëv.\nDenísov came out of the watchman’s hut and, having called Pétya, gave\r\n      orders to get ready."

    "text": "The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, tightened\r\n      their saddle girths, and formed companies. Denísov stood by the watchman’s\r\n      hut giving final orders. The infantry of the detachment passed along the\r\n      road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn,\r\n      hundreds of feet splashing through the mud. Theesaulgave some orders to\r\n      his men. Pétya held his horse by the bridle, impatiently awaiting the\r\n      order to mount. His face, having been bathed in cold water, was all aglow,\r\n      and his eyes were particularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down his spine\r\n      and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.\n“Well, is ev’wything weady?” asked Denísov. “Bwing the horses.”\nThe horses were brought. Denísov was angry with the Cossack because the\r\n      saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. Pétya put his\r\n      foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but\r\n      Pétya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and,\r\n      turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode\r\n      up to Denísov.\n“Vasíli Dmítrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for God’s\r\n      sake...!” said he.\nDenísov seemed to have forgotten Pétya’s very existence. He turned to\r\n      glance at him.\n“I ask one thing of you,” he said sternly, “to obey me and not shove\r\n      yourself forward anywhere.”\nHe did not say another word to Pétya but rode in silence all the way. When\r\n      they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light\r\n      over the field. Denísov talked in whispers with theesauland the Cossacks\r\n      rode past Pétya and Denísov. When they had all ridden by, Denísov touched\r\n      his horse and rode down the hill. Slipping onto their haunches and\r\n      sliding, the horses descended with their riders into the ravine. Pétya\r\n      rode beside Denísov, the pulsation of his body constantly increasing. It\r\n      was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid distant objects.\r\n      Having reached the valley, Denísov looked back and nodded to a Cossack\r\n      beside him.\n“The signal!” said he.\nThe Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp of\r\n      horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides, and\r\n      then more shots.\nAt the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Pétya lashed his horse\r\n      and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denísov who shouted\r\n      at him. It seemed to Pétya that at the moment the shot was fired it\r\n      suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge. Cossacks\r\n      were galloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge he collided\r\n      with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on. In front of him\r\n      soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were running from right to left across the\r\n      road. One of them fell in the mud under his horse’s feet.\nCossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the midst of\r\n      that crowd terrible screams arose. Pétya galloped up, and the first thing\r\n      he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman, clutching the\r\n      handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.\n“Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!” shouted Pétya, and giving rein to his excited\r\n      horse he galloped forward along the village street.\nHe could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged Russian\r\n      prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road, were shouting\r\n      something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking Frenchman, in a blue\r\n      overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face, had been defending\r\n      himself against the hussars. When Pétya galloped up the Frenchman had\r\n      already fallen. “Too late again!” flashed through Pétya’s mind and he\r\n      galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard. The\r\n      shots came from the yard of the landowner’s house he had visited the night\r\n      before with Dólokhov. The French were making a stand there behind a wattle\r\n      fence in a garden thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the\r\n      Cossacks who crowded at the gateway. Through the smoke, as he approached\r\n      the gate, Pétya saw Dólokhov, whose face was of a pale-greenish tint,\r\n      shouting to his men. “Go round! Wait for the infantry!” he exclaimed as\r\n      Pétya rode up to him.\n“Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!” shouted Pétya, and without pausing a moment\r\n      galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the smoke\r\n      was thickest.\nA volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed\r\n      against something. The Cossacks and Dólokhov galloped after Pétya into the\r\n      gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the French\r\n      threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the Cossacks,\r\n      while others ran down the hill toward the pond. Pétya was galloping along\r\n      the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms\r\n      about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther to one side in\r\n      his saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire that was\r\n      smoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and Pétya fell heavily\r\n      on to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked\r\n      rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had pierced his\r\n      skull.\nAfter speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house\r\n      with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they\r\n      surrendered, Dólokhov dismounted and went up to Pétya, who lay motionless\r\n      with outstretched arms.\n“Done for!” he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet Denísov who\r\n      was riding toward him.\n“Killed?” cried Denísov, recognizing from a distance the unmistakably\r\n      lifeless attitude—very familiar to him—in which Pétya’s body\r\n      was lying.\n“Done for!” repeated Dólokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded\r\n      him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who were surrounded\r\n      by Cossacks who had hurried up. “We won’t take them!” he called out to\r\n      Denísov.\nDenísov did not reply; he rode up to Pétya, dismounted, and with trembling\r\n      hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered face which\r\n      had already gone white.\n“I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!” he\r\n      recalled Pétya’s words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the\r\n      sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Denísov turned away, walked to\r\n      the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.\nAmong the Russian prisoners rescued by Denísov and Dólokhov was Pierre\r\n      Bezúkhov."

    "text": "During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been\r\n      issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners among\r\n      whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party was no longer\r\n      with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left Moscow.\r\n      Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages\r\n      with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other half had gone on ahead.\r\n      Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the\r\n      prisoners was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery the prisoners\r\n      had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by\r\n      Marshal Junot’s enormous baggage train, convoyed by Westphalians. Behind\r\n      the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.\nFrom Vyázma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in three\r\n      columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder that Pierre\r\n      had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now\r\n      reached the utmost limit.\nThe road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead horses;\r\n      ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments continually\r\n      changed about, now joining the moving column, now again lagging behind it.\nSeveral times during the march false alarms had been given and the\r\n      soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run headlong,\r\n      crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other\r\n      for their causeless panic.\nThese three groups traveling together—the cavalry stores, the convoy\r\n      of prisoners, and Junot’s baggage train—still constituted a separate\r\n      and united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.\nOf the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty\r\n      wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been captured or\r\n      left behind. Some of Junot’s wagons also had been captured or abandoned.\r\n      Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from Davout’s corps.\r\n      From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that a larger guard had been\r\n      allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners, and that one of\r\n      their comrades, a German soldier, had been shot by the marshal’s own order\r\n      because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his\r\n      possession.\nThe group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three hundred\r\n      and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now\r\n      remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the\r\n      cavalry saddles or Junot’s baggage. They understood that the saddles and\r\n      Junot’s spoon might be of some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers\r\n      should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who froze\r\n      and lagged behind on the road (in which case the order was to shoot them)\r\n      was not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the escort, as if\r\n      afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in, of giving way\r\n      to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight\r\n      still worse, treated them with particular moroseness and severity.\nAt Dorogobúzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the\r\n      prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, several\r\n      of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away, but were\r\n      recaptured by the French and shot.\nThe arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners\r\n      should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned. All\r\n      who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had\r\n      rejoined Karatáev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen\r\n      Karatáev for its master.\nOn the third day after leaving Moscow Karatáev again fell ill with the\r\n      fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew\r\n      gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know why, but\r\n      since Karatáev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go\r\n      near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which Karatáev\r\n      generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled the odor\r\n      emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre moved\r\n      farther away and did not think about him.\nWhile imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect but\r\n      with his whole being, by life itself, that man is created for happiness,\r\n      that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple human needs,\r\n      and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity.\r\n      And now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still\r\n      another new, consolatory truth—that nothing in this world is\r\n      terrible. He had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be\r\n      happy and entirely free, so there is no condition in which he need be\r\n      unhappy and lack freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom have their\r\n      limits and that those limits are very near together; that the person in a\r\n      bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now,\r\n      sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the\r\n      other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had\r\n      suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were\r\n      covered with sores—his footgear having long since fallen to pieces.\r\n      He discovered that when he had married his wife—of his own free will\r\n      as it had seemed to him—he had been no more free than now when they\r\n      locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself subsequently\r\n      termed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt, the worst\r\n      was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh was\r\n      appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used\r\n      instead of salt was even pleasant; there was no great cold, it was always\r\n      warm walking in the daytime, and at night there were the campfires; the\r\n      lice that devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing that was at first\r\n      hard to bear was his feet.\nAfter the second day’s march Pierre, having examined his feet by the\r\n      campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when\r\n      everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,\r\n      walked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more\r\n      terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now, but\r\n      thought of other things.\nOnly now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the\r\n      saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to\r\n      another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows\r\n      superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit.\nHe did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged\r\n      behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did not think\r\n      of Karatáev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to\r\n      share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about himself. The harder his\r\n      position became and the more terrible the future, the more independent of\r\n      that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting\r\n      thoughts, memories, and imaginings that came to him."

    "text": "At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill along\r\n      the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the roughness of the\r\n      way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then\r\n      again at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar and his\r\n      own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the\r\n      road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction lifting one\r\n      hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on all four and\r\n      rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The dog was merrier\r\n      and sleeker than it had been in Moscow. All around lay the flesh of\r\n      different animals—from men to horses—in various stages of\r\n      decomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog\r\n      could eat all it wanted.\nIt had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it\r\n      might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining\r\n      harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed the water, which\r\n      ran along the ruts in streams.\nPierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps in\r\n      threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally addressing the\r\n      rain, he repeated: “Now then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!”\nIt seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and deep\r\n      within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting.\r\n      This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation\r\n      with Karatáev the day before.\nAt their yesterday’s halting place, feeling chilly by a dying campfire,\r\n      Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was burning better.\r\n      There Platón Karatáev was sitting covered up—head and all—with\r\n      his greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his\r\n      effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It was\r\n      already past midnight, the hour when Karatáev was usually free of his\r\n      fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the fire and heard\r\n      Platón’s voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face brightly\r\n      lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His feeling of\r\n      pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away, but there was\r\n      no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at Platón.\n“Well, how are you?” he asked.\n“How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won’t grant us death,” replied\r\n      Platón, and at once resumed the story he had begun.\n“And so, brother,” he continued, with a smile on his pale emaciated face\r\n      and a particularly happy light in his eyes, “you see, brother...”\nPierre had long been familiar with that story. Karatáev had told it to him\r\n      alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful emotion.\r\n      But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that tale as to something\r\n      new, and the quiet rapture Karatáev evidently felt as he told it\r\n      communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was of an old merchant who\r\n      lived a good and God-fearing life with his family, and who went once to\r\n      the Nízhni fair with a companion—a rich merchant.\nHaving put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning his\r\n      companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained knife\r\n      was found under the old merchant’s pillow. He was tried, knouted, and his\r\n      nostrils having been torn off, “all in due form” as Karatáev put it, he\r\n      was sent to hard labor in Siberia.\n“And so, brother” (it was at this point that Pierre came up), “ten years\r\n      or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as he\r\n      should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one\r\n      night the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among\r\n      them. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they had\r\n      sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had taken\r\n      two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply been a\r\n      vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: ‘What are you\r\n      being punished for, Daddy?’—‘I, my dear brothers,’ said he, ‘am\r\n      being punished for my own and other men’s sins. But I have not killed\r\n      anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my poorer\r\n      brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much property. ‘And\r\n      he went on to tell them all about it in due order. ‘I don’t grieve for\r\n      myself,’ he says, ‘God, it seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my\r\n      old wife and the children,’ and the old man began to weep. Now it happened\r\n      that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant.\r\n      ‘Where did it happen, Daddy?’ he said. ‘When, and in what month?’ He asked\r\n      all about it and his heart began to ache. So he comes up to the old man\r\n      like this, and falls down at his feet! ‘You are perishing because of me,\r\n      Daddy,’ he says. ‘It’s quite true, lads, that this man,’ he says, ‘is\r\n      being tortured innocently and for nothing! I,’ he says, ‘did that deed,\r\n      and I put the knife under your head while you were asleep. Forgive me,\r\n      Daddy,’ he says, ‘for Christ’s sake!’”\nKaratáev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and he drew\r\n      the logs together.\n“And the old man said, ‘God will forgive you, we are all sinners in His\r\n      sight. I suffer for my own sins,’ and he wept bitter tears. Well, and what\r\n      do you think, dear friends?” Karatáev continued, his face brightening more\r\n      and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained\r\n      the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story: “What do you think,\r\n      dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the authorities. ‘I have taken\r\n      six lives,’ he says (he was a great sinner), ‘but what I am most sorry for\r\n      is this old man. Don’t let him suffer because of me.’ So he confessed and\r\n      it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form. The place was\r\n      a long way off, and while they were judging, what with one thing and\r\n      another, filling in the papers all in due form—the authorities I\r\n      mean—time passed. The affair reached the Tsar. After a while the\r\n      Tsar’s decree came: to set the merchant free and give him a compensation\r\n      that had been awarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the\r\n      old man. ‘Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in\r\n      vain? A paper has come from the Tsar!’ so they began looking for him,”\r\n       here Karatáev’s lower jaw trembled, “but God had already forgiven him—he\r\n      was dead! That’s how it was, dear fellows!” Karatáev concluded and sat for\r\n      a long time silent, gazing before him with a smile.\nAnd Pierre’s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself\r\n      but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up\r\n      Karatáev’s face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy."

    "text": "“À vos places!”* suddenly cried a voice.\n* “To your places.”\nA pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful\r\n      and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners.\r\n      From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left came smartly\r\n      dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the prisoners at a trot. The\r\n      expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of\r\n      those in authority. The prisoners thronged together and were pushed off\r\n      the road. The convoy formed up.\n“The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!” and hardly had the\r\n      sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled\r\n      by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a\r\n      tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the\r\n      marshals. His eye fell on Pierre’s large and striking figure, and in the\r\n      expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he\r\n      detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.\nThe general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red\r\n      and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several officers formed\r\n      a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their faces all looked\r\n      excited and worried.\n“What did he say? What did he say?” Pierre heard them ask.\nWhile the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a\r\n      crowd, and Pierre saw Karatáev whom he had not yet seen that morning. He\r\n      sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face,\r\n      besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the\r\n      tale of the merchant who suffered innocently, there was now an expression\r\n      of quiet solemnity.\nKaratáev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with\r\n      tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to\r\n      him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he did\r\n      not notice that look and moved hastily away.\nWhen the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. Karatáev was\r\n      still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two\r\n      Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again but\r\n      went limping up the hill.\nFrom behind, where Karatáev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot.\r\n      Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he had not\r\n      yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to Smolénsk—a\r\n      calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And he again started\r\n      reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of whom carried a\r\n      lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and in the expression on\r\n      their faces—one of them glanced timidly at Pierre—there was\r\n      something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at\r\n      the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that, two days\r\n      before, that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how\r\n      they had laughed at him.\nBehind him, where Karatáev had been sitting, the dog began to howl. “What\r\n      a stupid beast! Why is it howling?” thought Pierre.\nHis comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking\r\n      back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling,\r\n      just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces."

    "text": "The stores, the prisoners, and the marshal’s baggage train stopped at the\r\n      village of Shámshevo. The men crowded together round the campfires. Pierre\r\n      went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his back to\r\n      the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again slept as he had done at\r\n      Mozháysk after the battle of Borodinó.\nAgain real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or another,\r\n      gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had\r\n      been expressed in his dream at Mozháysk.\n“Life is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and that\r\n      movement is God. And while there is life there is joy in consciousness of\r\n      the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and more blessed than all\r\n      else is to love this life in one’s sufferings, in innocent sufferings.”\n“Karatáev!” came to Pierre’s mind.\nAnd suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly old man\r\n      who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. “Wait a bit,” said the\r\n      old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was alive—a vibrating\r\n      ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted of drops\r\n      closely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed places,\r\n      sometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one dividing into\r\n      many. Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible,\r\n      but others striving to do the same compressed it, sometimes destroyed it,\r\n      and sometimes merged with it.\n“That is life,” said the old teacher.\n“How simple and clear it is,” thought Pierre. “How is it I did not know it\r\n      before?”\n“God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect Him\r\n      to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from the surface,\r\n      sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now, Karatáev has spread out\r\n      and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?” said the teacher.\n“Do you understand, damn you?” shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.\nHe lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian\r\n      soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece of\r\n      meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy, hairy,\r\n      red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod. His brown\r\n      morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the\r\n      charcoal.\n“It’s all the same to him,” he muttered, turning quickly to a soldier who\r\n      stood behind him. “Brigand! Get away!”\nAnd twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned away and\r\n      gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier the Frenchman had\r\n      pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand.\r\n      Looking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog, sitting beside\r\n      the soldier, wagging its tail.\n“Ah, he’s come?” said Pierre. “And Plat—” he began, but did not finish.\nSuddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy—of\r\n      the look Platón had given him as he sat under the tree, of the shot heard\r\n      from that spot, of the dog’s howl, of the guilty faces of the two\r\n      Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of\r\n      Karatáev’s absence at this halt—and he was on the point of realizing\r\n      that Karatáev had been killed, but just at that instant, he knew not why,\r\n      the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a\r\n      beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And without\r\n      linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them, Pierre\r\n      closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with\r\n      memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating globe, and he sank into\r\n      water so that it closed over his head.\nBefore sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing. French\r\n      soldiers were running past him.\n“The Cossacks!” one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of\r\n      Russians surrounded Pierre.\nFor a long time he could not understand what was happening to him. All\r\n      around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.\n“Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!” old soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as\r\n      they embraced Cossacks and hussars.\nThe hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered them\r\n      clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he sat among\r\n      them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier who\r\n      approached him, and kissed him, weeping.\nDólokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd of\r\n      disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had happened,\r\n      were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed Dólokhov who\r\n      gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them with cold glassy\r\n      eyes that boded no good, they became silent. On the opposite side stood\r\n      Dólokhov’s Cossack, counting the prisoners and marking off each hundred\r\n      with a chalk line on the gate.\n“How many?” Dólokhov asked the Cossack.\n“The second hundred,” replied the Cossack.\n“Filez, filez!”* Dólokhov kept saying, having adopted\r\n      this expression from the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners\r\n      they flashed with a cruel light.\n* “Get along, get along!”\nDenísov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks\r\n      who were carrying the body of Pétya Rostóv to a hole that had been dug in\r\n      the garden."

    "text": "After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of\r\n      the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing, or\r\n      roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages with people\r\n      dressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the property that\r\n      had been stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but the process of the\r\n      flight and disintegration of the French army went on essentially as\r\n      before.\nFrom Moscow to Vyázma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not\r\n      reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but pillage)\r\n      was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five thousand had\r\n      fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding terms of the\r\n      progression could be determined mathematically. The French army melted\r\n      away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vyázma, from Vyázma to\r\n      Smolénsk, from Smolénsk to the Berëzina, and from the Berëzina to Vílna—independently\r\n      of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the pursuit, the barring\r\n      of the way, or any other particular conditions. Beyond Vyázma the French\r\n      army instead of moving in three columns huddled together into one mass,\r\n      and so went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his Emperor (we know how far\r\n      commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in\r\n      describing the condition of an army) and this is what he said:\n\nI deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the various\r\n      corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last\r\n      two or three days’ march. They are almost disbanded. Scarcely a quarter of\r\n      the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others go\r\n      off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and escape\r\n      discipline. In general they regard Smolénsk as the place where they hope\r\n      to recover. During the last few days many of the men have been seen to\r\n      throw away their cartridges and their arms. In such a state of affairs,\r\n      whatever your ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your Majesty’s\r\n      service demands that the army should be rallied at Smolénsk and should\r\n      first of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted cavalry,\r\n      unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no longer in\r\n      proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who are worn out with\r\n      hunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well as a few days’ rest. Many\r\n      have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This state of\r\n      things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that unless a\r\n      prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in\r\n      case of an engagement.\nNovember 9: twenty miles from Smolénsk.\n\nAfter staggering into Smolénsk which seemed to them a promised land, the\r\n      French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own stores,\r\n      and when everything had been plundered fled farther.\nThey all went without knowing whither or why they were going. Still less\r\n      did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to him.\r\n      But still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote\r\n      commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one anothersire, mon cousin, prince d’Eckmühl, roi de Naples, and so on. But\r\n      these orders and reports were only on paper, nothing in them was acted upon for\r\n      they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one another\r\n      Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, they all felt that they were miserable\r\n      wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay. And though\r\n      they pretended to be concerned about the army, each was thinking only of\r\n      himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself."

    "text": "The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign from\r\n      Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian blindman’s\r\n      buff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of them occasionally\r\n      rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his whereabouts. First he\r\n      rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into a tight place he runs\r\n      away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to escape runs straight into\r\n      his opponent’s arms.\nAt first while they were still moving along the Kalúga road, Napoleon’s\r\n      armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the Smolénsk\r\n      road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight—and often\r\n      thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.\nOwing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit and the\r\n      consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of approximately\r\n      ascertaining the enemy’s position—by cavalry scouting—was not\r\n      available. Besides, as a result of the frequent and rapid change of\r\n      position by each army, even what information was obtained could not be\r\n      delivered in time. If news was received one day that the enemy had been in\r\n      a certain position the day before, by the third day when something could\r\n      have been done, that army was already two days’ march farther on and in\r\n      quite another position.\nOne army fled and the other pursued. Beyond Smolénsk there were several\r\n      different roads available for the French, and one would have thought that\r\n      during their stay of four days they might have learned where the enemy\r\n      was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan and undertaken\r\n      something new. But after a four days’ halt the mob, with no maneuvers or\r\n      plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither to the right\r\n      nor to the left but along the old—the worst—road, through\r\n      Krásnoe and Orshá.\nExpecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated in\r\n      their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours. In front\r\n      of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. The Russian\r\n      army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the Dnieper—which\r\n      was the only reasonable thing for him to do—themselves turned to the\r\n      right and came out onto the highroad at Krásnoe. And here as in a game of\r\n      blindman’s buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing their enemy\r\n      unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped short from the\r\n      sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight, abandoning their\r\n      comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days separate portions of\r\n      the French army—first Murat’s (the vice-king’s), then Davout’s, and\r\n      then Ney’s—ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the Russian army. They\r\n      abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy baggage, their artillery,\r\n      and half their men, and fled, getting past the Russians by night by making\r\n      semicircles to the right.\nNey, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of\r\n      Smolénsk which were in nobody’s way, because despite the unfortunate\r\n      plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor\r\n      against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of ten\r\n      thousand men, reached Napoleon at Orshá with only one thousand men left,\r\n      having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having crossed the\r\n      Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.\nFrom Orshá they fled farther along the road to Vílna, still playing at\r\n      blindman’s buff with the pursuing army. At the Berëzina they again became\r\n      disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those who got\r\n      across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a fur coat and,\r\n      having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone, abandoning his\r\n      companions. The others who could do so drove away too, leaving those who\r\n      could not to surrender or die."

    "text": "This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did\r\n      all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they turned onto the\r\n      Kalúga road to the day their leader fled from the army, none of the\r\n      movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might have thought that\r\n      regarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed the\r\n      actions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it impossible\r\n      to make the story of the retreat fit their theory. But no! Mountains of\r\n      books have been written by the historians about this campaign, and\r\n      everywhere are described Napoleon’s arrangements, the maneuvers, and his\r\n      profound plans which guided the army, as well as the military genius shown\r\n      by his marshals.\nThe retreat from Málo-Yaroslávets when he had a free road into a\r\n      well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along which\r\n      Kutúzov afterwards pursued him—this unnecessary retreat along a\r\n      devastated road—is explained to us as being due to profound\r\n      considerations. Similarly profound considerations are given for his\r\n      retreat from Smolénsk to Orshá. Then his heroism at Krásnoe is described,\r\n      where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take\r\n      personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick and said:\n“J’ai assez fait l’empereur; il est temps de faire le\r\n      général,”* but nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning\r\n      to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he left behind.\n* “I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act\r\n     the general.”\nThen we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, especially of\r\n      Ney—a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he made his way by\r\n      night around through the forest and across the Dnieper and escaped to\r\n      Orshá, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his men.\nAnd lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic army\r\n      is presented to us by the historians as something great and characteristic\r\n      of genius. Even that final running away, described in ordinary language as\r\n      the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed of—even\r\n      that act finds justification in the historians’ language.\nWhen it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical\r\n      ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly contrary to all that\r\n      humanity calls right or even just, the historians produce a saving\r\n      conception of “greatness.” “Greatness,” it seems, excludes the standards\r\n      of right and wrong. For the “great” man nothing is wrong, there is no\r\n      atrocity for which a “great” man can be blamed.\n“C’est grand!”* say the historians, and there no longer\r\n      exists either good or evil but only“grand”and “notgrand.” Grandis good, notgrandis bad.Grandis the\r\n      characteristic, in their conception, of some special animals called\r\n      “heroes.” And Napoleon, escaping home in a warm fur coat and leaving to\r\n      perish those who were not merely his comrades but were (in his opinion) men he had\r\n      brought there, feelsque c’est grand, *(2) and his soul is tranquil.\n* “It is great.”\n* (2) That it is great.\n“Du sublime(he saw something sublime in himself)au ridicule il n’y a\r\n      qu’un pas,”* said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been\r\n      repeating:“Sublime! Grand! Napoléon le Grand!” Du sublime au ridicule il\r\n      n’y a qu’un pas.\n* “From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.”\nAnd it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with\r\n      the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one’s own nothingness\r\n      and immeasurable meanness.\nFor us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human\r\n      actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity,\r\n      goodness, and truth are absent."

    "text": "What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign of\r\n      1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,\r\n      dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is that\r\n      the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies\r\n      surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry\r\n      and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate)\r\n      the aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and\r\n      capture them all?\nHow was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the\r\n      French had given battle at Borodinó, did not achieve its purpose when it\r\n      had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture\r\n      them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had\r\n      surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could\r\n      that happen?\nHistory (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions says\r\n      that this occurred because Kutúzov and Tormásov and Chichagóv, and this\r\n      man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers....\nBut why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were guilty\r\n      of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished?\r\n      But even if we admitted that Kutúzov, Chichagóv, and others were the cause\r\n      of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehensible why, the position of\r\n      the Russian army being what it was at Krásnoe and at the Berëzina (in both\r\n      cases we had superior forces), the French army with its marshals, kings,\r\n      and Emperor was not captured, if that was what the Russians aimed at.\nThe explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military historians\r\n      (to the effect that Kutúzov hindered an attack) is unfounded, for we know\r\n      that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at Vyázma and\r\n      Tarútino.\nWhy was the Russian army—which with inferior forces had withstood\r\n      the enemy in full strength at Borodinó—defeated at Krásnoe and the\r\n      Berëzina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically\r\n      superior?\nIf the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing Napoleon\r\n      and his marshals—and that aim was not merely frustrated but all\r\n      attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled—then this last\r\n      period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a\r\n      series of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian\r\n      historians.\nThe Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of\r\n      logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies\r\n      about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit that the\r\n      French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for Napoleon and\r\n      defeats for Kutúzov.\nBut putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a\r\n      conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French victories\r\n      brought the French complete destruction, while the series of Russian\r\n      defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of\r\n      their country.\nThe source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians\r\n      studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals,\r\n      from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this\r\n      last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of\r\n      cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.\nThere never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been\r\n      senseless and its attainment quite impossible.\nIt would have been senseless, first because Napoleon’s disorganized army\r\n      was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that is to say, was doing\r\n      just what every Russian desired. So what was the use of performing various\r\n      operations on the French who were running away as fast as they possibly\r\n      could?\nSecondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose\r\n      whole energy was directed to flight.\nThirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one’s own troops in\r\n      order to destroy the French army, which without external interference was\r\n      destroying itself at such a rate that, though its path was not blocked, it\r\n      could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in December,\r\n      namely a hundredth part of the original army.\nFourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the\r\n      Emperor, kings, and dukes—whose capture would have been in the\r\n      highest degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit\r\n      diplomatists of the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. Still\r\n      more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the\r\n      French, when our own army had melted away to half before reaching Krásnoe\r\n      and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of\r\n      prisoners, and when our men were not always getting full rations and the\r\n      prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger.\nAll the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his\r\n      army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of his\r\n      garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should run to\r\n      the gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said in excuse\r\n      of that gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even that could\r\n      be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not they who had\r\n      suffered from the trampled beds.\nBut besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have\r\n      been senseless, it was impossible.\nIt was impossible first because—as experience shows that a\r\n      three-mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the\r\n      plans—the probability of Chichagóv, Kutúzov, and Wittgenstein\r\n      effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be\r\n      tantamount to impossibility, as in fact thought Kutúzov, who when he\r\n      received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do\r\n      not yield the desired results.\nSecondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with which\r\n      Napoleon’s army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the\r\n      Russians possessed would have been required.\nThirdly it was impossible, because the military term “to cut off” has no\r\n      meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut off an\r\n      army—to bar its road—is quite impossible, for there is always\r\n      plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be\r\n      seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example\r\n      of Krásnoe and of the Berëzina. It is only possible to capture prisoners\r\n      if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible to catch a\r\n      swallow if it settles on one’s hand. Men can only be taken prisoners if\r\n      they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics, as the\r\n      Germans did. But the French troops quite rightly did not consider that\r\n      this suited them, since death by hunger and cold awaited them in flight or\r\n      captivity alike.\nFourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world\r\n      began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained\r\n      in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its\r\n      strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying\r\n      itself.\nDuring the movement of the Russian army from Tarútino to Krásnoe it lost\r\n      fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the\r\n      population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of the army\r\n      without a battle.\nAnd it is of this period of the campaign—when the army lacked boots\r\n      and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and was\r\n      camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost,\r\n      when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was\r\n      night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained, when men\r\n      were taken into that region of death where discipline fails, not for a few\r\n      hours only as in a battle, but for months, where they were every moment\r\n      fighting death from hunger and cold, when half the army perished in a\r\n      single month—it is of this period of the campaign that the\r\n      historians tell us how Milorádovich should have made a flank march to such\r\n      and such a place, Tormásov to another place, and Chichagóv should have\r\n      crossed (more than knee-deep in snow) to somewhere else, and how so-and-so\r\n      “routed” and “cut off” the French and so on and so on.\nThe Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been\r\n      done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame\r\n      because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should\r\n      do what was impossible.\nAll that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the\r\n      facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians\r\n      dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words\r\n      and sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.\nTo them the words of Milorádovich seem very interesting, and so do their\r\n      surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question\r\n      of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does\r\n      not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of their\r\n      investigation.\nYet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and\r\n      consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a\r\n      direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble\r\n      easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.\nThe aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in the\r\n      imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it was\r\n      senseless and unattainable.\nThe people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. That aim\r\n      was attained in the first place of itself, as the French ran away, and so\r\n      it was only necessary not to stop their flight. Secondly it was attained\r\n      by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the French, and thirdly by\r\n      the fact that a large Russian army was following the French, ready to use\r\n      its strength in case their movement stopped.\nThe Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the\r\n      experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace\r\n      than to strike the running animal on the head."

    "text": "When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror: substance\r\n      similar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But when it is a beloved\r\n      and intimate human being that is dying, besides this horror at the\r\n      extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual wound, which like a\r\n      physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals, but always aches\r\n      and shrinks at any external irritating touch.\nAfter Prince Andrew’s death Natásha and Princess Mary alike felt this.\r\n      Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of\r\n      death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face. They\r\n      carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact.\r\n      Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to dinner,\r\n      the maid’s inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any word of\r\n      insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully irritated the\r\n      wound, interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to\r\n      listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their\r\n      imagination, and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless\r\n      vistas that for an instant had opened out before them.\nOnly when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain. They\r\n      spoke little even to one another, and when they did it was of very\r\n      unimportant matters.\nBoth avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of a\r\n      future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did they\r\n      avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them that what\r\n      they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words,\r\n      and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the majesty\r\n      and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their\r\n      eyes.\nContinued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of everything\r\n      that might lead up to the subject—this halting on all sides at the\r\n      boundary of what they might not mention—brought before their minds\r\n      with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling.\nBut pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy.\r\n      Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her\r\n      own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was the first to be\r\n      called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for\r\n      the first fortnight. She received letters from her relations to which she\r\n      had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put was damp and\r\n      he began to cough; Alpátych came to Yaroslávl with reports on the state of\r\n      their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to\r\n      Moscow to the house on the Vozdvízhenka Street, which had remained\r\n      uninjured and needed only slight repairs. Life did not stand still and it\r\n      was necessary to live. Hard as it was for Princess Mary to emerge from the\r\n      realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then, and\r\n      sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave Natásha alone, yet the cares\r\n      of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them. She\r\n      went through the accounts with Alpátych, conferred with Dessalles about\r\n      her nephew, and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to\r\n      Moscow.\nNatásha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making\r\n      preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.\nPrincess Mary asked the countess to let Natásha go with her to Moscow, and\r\n      both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw their daughter\r\n      losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the\r\n      advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.\n“I am not going anywhere,” Natásha replied when this was proposed to her.\r\n      “Do please just leave me alone!” And she ran out of the room, with\r\n      difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of\r\n      sorrow.\nAfter she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief,\r\n      Natásha spent most of the time in her room by herself, sitting huddled up\r\n      feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and twisting something\r\n      with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at\r\n      whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This solitude exhausted and\r\n      tormented her but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as anyone\r\n      entered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and\r\n      picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the\r\n      intruder to go.\nShe felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on\r\n      which—with a terrible questioning too great for her strength—her\r\n      spiritual gaze was fixed.\nOne day toward the end of December Natásha, pale and thin, dressed in a\r\n      black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was\r\n      crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and\r\n      smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the\r\n      door.\nShe was gazing in the direction in which he had gone—to the other\r\n      side of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never before\r\n      thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable,\r\n      was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of\r\n      life, where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering\r\n      and indignity.\nShe was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine him\r\n      otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he had been\r\n      at Mytíshchi, at Tróitsa, and at Yaroslávl.\nShe saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own, and\r\n      sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.\nThere he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning his\r\n      head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his\r\n      shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and a\r\n      wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs twitches just\r\n      perceptibly, but rapidly. Natásha knows that he is struggling with\r\n      terrible pain. “What is that pain like? Why does he have that pain? What\r\n      does he feel? How does it hurt him?” thought Natásha. He noticed her\r\n      watching him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:\n“One thing would be terrible,” said he: “to bind oneself forever to a\r\n      suffering man. It would be continual torture.” And he looked searchingly\r\n      at her. Natásha as usual answered before she had time to think what she\r\n      would say. She said: “This can’t go on—it won’t. You will get well—quite\r\n      well.”\nShe now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she\r\n      had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words\r\n      and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted\r\n      gaze.\n“I agreed,” Natásha now said to herself, “that it would be dreadful if he\r\n      always continued to suffer. I said it then only because it would have been\r\n      dreadful for him, but he understood it differently. He thought it would be\r\n      dreadful for me. He then still wished to live and feared death. And I said\r\n      it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I meant. I thought quite\r\n      differently. Had I said what I thought, I should have said: even if he had\r\n      to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes, I should have been\r\n      happy compared with what I am now. Now there is nothing... nobody. Did he\r\n      know that? No, he did not and never will know it. And now it will never,\r\n      never be possible to put it right.” And now he again seemed to be saying\r\n      the same words to her, only in her imagination Natásha this time gave him\r\n      a different answer. She stopped him and said: “Terrible for you, but not\r\n      for me! You know that for me there is nothing in life but you, and to\r\n      suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me,” and he took her hand\r\n      and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before\r\n      his death. And in her imagination she said other tender and loving words\r\n      which she might have said then but only spoke now: “I love thee!... thee!\r\n      I love, love...” she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her\r\n      teeth with a desperate effort....\nShe was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her\r\n      eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this. Again\r\n      everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a strained\r\n      frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now it seemed to\r\n      her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the instant when it seemed\r\n      that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the\r\n      door handle struck painfully on her ears. Dunyásha, her maid, entered the\r\n      room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing\r\n      no concern for her mistress.\n“Come to your Papa at once, please!” said she with a strange, excited\r\n      look. “A misfortune... about Peter Ilýnich... a letter,” she finished with\r\n      a sob."

    "text": "Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Natásha was feeling a\r\n      special estrangement from the members of her own family. All of them—her\r\n      father, mother, and Sónya—were so near to her, so familiar, so\r\n      commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the\r\n      world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not merely\r\n      indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard Dunyásha’s\r\n      words about Peter Ilýnich and a misfortune, but did not grasp them.\n“What misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live their\r\n      own old, quiet, and commonplace life,” thought Natásha.\nAs she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her\r\n      mother’s room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He had\r\n      evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking\r\n      him. When he saw Natásha he waved his arms despairingly and burst into\r\n      convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face.\n“Pe... Pétya... Go, go, she... is calling...” and weeping like a child and\r\n      quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost fell into it,\r\n      covering his face with his hands.\nSuddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Natásha’s whole being.\r\n      Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache as if\r\n      something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But the pain was\r\n      immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive\r\n      constraint that had prevented her taking part in life. The sight of her\r\n      father, the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the\r\n      door, made her immediately forget herself and her own grief.\nShe ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to her\r\n      mother’s door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came out from\r\n      that room and taking Natásha by the arm said something to her. Natásha\r\n      neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, pausing at the\r\n      door for an instant as if struggling with herself, and then ran to her\r\n      mother.\nThe countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position,\r\n      stretching out and beating her head against the wall. Sónya and the maids\r\n      were holding her arms.\n“Natásha! Natásha!...” cried the countess. “It’s not true... it’s not\r\n      true... He’s lying... Natásha!” she shrieked, pushing those around her\r\n      away. “Go away, all of you; it’s not true! Killed!... ha, ha, ha!... It’s\r\n      not true!”\nNatásha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother, embraced\r\n      her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face toward\r\n      herself, and clung to her.\n“Mummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy,” she kept on\r\n      whispering, not pausing an instant.\nShe did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her, demanded\r\n      a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her mother’s dress.\n“My dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...” she whispered incessantly,\r\n      kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her own irrepressible\r\n      and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.\nThe countess pressed her daughter’s hand, closed her eyes, and became\r\n      quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness,\r\n      glanced vacantly around her, and seeing Natásha began to press her\r\n      daughter’s head with all her strength. Then she turned toward her\r\n      daughter’s face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it.\n“Natásha, you love me?” she said in a soft trustful whisper. “Natásha, you\r\n      would not deceive me? You’ll tell me the whole truth?”\nNatásha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was\r\n      nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.\n“My darling Mummy!” she repeated, straining all the power of her love to\r\n      find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her\r\n      mother.\nAnd again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing to\r\n      believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom\r\n      of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.\nNatásha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the next\r\n      day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother. Her\r\n      persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess\r\n      every moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling her to life.\nDuring the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes, and\r\n      Natásha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes, but\r\n      opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was sitting\r\n      up in bed and speaking softly.\n“How glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won’t you have some tea?”\r\n       Natásha went up to her. “You have improved in looks and grown more manly,”\r\n       continued the countess, taking her daughter’s hand.\n“Mamma! What are you saying...”\n“Natásha, he is no more, no more!”\nAnd embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first time."

    "text": "Princess Mary postponed her departure. Sónya and the count tried to\r\n      replace Natásha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to\r\n      restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks Natásha\r\n      remained constantly at her mother’s side, sleeping on a lounge chair in\r\n      her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly because\r\n      the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her mother.\nThe mother’s wounded spirit could not heal. Pétya’s death had torn from\r\n      her half her life. When the news of Pétya’s death had come she had been a\r\n      fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room a\r\n      listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that\r\n      almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Natásha to life.\nA spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a\r\n      physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may heal\r\n      and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal\r\n      completely only as the result of a vital force from within.\nNatásha’s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but\r\n      her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life—love—was\r\n      still active within her. Love awoke and so did life.\nPrince Andrew’s last days had bound Princess Mary and Natásha together;\r\n      this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary\r\n      put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Natásha as if she\r\n      had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother’s bedroom had\r\n      strained Natásha’s physical strength.\nOne afternoon noticing Natásha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took\r\n      her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Natásha lay down,\r\n      but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called\r\n      her back.\n“I don’t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.”\n“You are tired—try to sleep.”\n“No, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.”\n“She is much better. She spoke so well today,” said Princess Mary.\nNatásha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned\r\n      Princess Mary’s face.\n“Is she like him?” thought Natásha. “Yes, like and yet not like. But she\r\n      is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What is in\r\n      her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What does she\r\n      think about me? Yes, she is splendid!”\n“Mary,” she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary’s hand to herself, “Mary,\r\n      you mustn’t think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you! Let us be\r\n      quite, quite friends.”\nAnd Natásha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making\r\n      Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings.\nFrom that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only\r\n      between women was established between Princess Mary and Natásha. They were\r\n      continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most\r\n      of their time together. When one went out the other became restless and\r\n      hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony with one\r\n      another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A feeling\r\n      stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive feeling of\r\n      life being possible only in each other’s presence.\nSometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already in\r\n      bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They spoke most of\r\n      what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her mother,\r\n      her father, and her daydreams; and Natásha, who with a passive lack of\r\n      understanding had formerly turned away from that life of devotion,\r\n      submission, and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice, now feeling\r\n      herself bound to Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her past too\r\n      and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her. She\r\n      did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life,\r\n      for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood and loved in\r\n      another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For Princess Mary,\r\n      listening to Natásha’s tales of childhood and early youth, there also\r\n      opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life: belief in life\r\n      and its enjoyment.\nJust as before, they never mentionedhimso as not to lower (as they\r\n      thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him had\r\n      the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being\r\n      conscious of it.\nNatásha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all\r\n      talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was\r\n      suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness, and\r\n      loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm carefully,\r\n      surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her drawn and, as it\r\n      seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed to her that things\r\n      must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.\nOne day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.\r\n      Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and then,\r\n      testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.\nAnother time when she called Dunyásha her voice trembled, so she called\r\n      again—though she could hear Dunyásha coming—called her in the\r\n      deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened\r\n      attentively to herself.\nShe did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer of\r\n      slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate young\r\n      shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so cover\r\n      with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would\r\n      soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal from\r\n      within.\nAt the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count\r\n      insisted on Natásha’s going with her to consult the doctors."

    "text": "After the encounter at Vyázma, where Kutúzov had been unable to hold back\r\n      his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on,\r\n      the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians who\r\n      pursued them, continued as far as Krásnoe without a battle. The flight was\r\n      so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could not keep up with\r\n      them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the information\r\n      received of the movements of the French was never reliable.\nThe men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching\r\n      at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any faster.\nTo realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only\r\n      necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not losing\r\n      more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarútino and less than a\r\n      hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a hundred\r\n      thousand strong reached Krásnoe with only fifty thousand.\nThe rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as\r\n      the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that the\r\n      Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction as hung\r\n      over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind in enemy\r\n      hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their own people. The\r\n      chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon’s army was the rapidity of its\r\n      movement, and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of\r\n      the Russian army.\nKutúzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the\r\n      movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian\r\n      army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at\r\n      Tarútino and Vyázma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our\r\n      army.\nBut besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army\r\n      caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another reason\r\n      for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kutúzov. The aim\r\n      of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the French would\r\n      take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the\r\n      greater distance they had to cover. Only by following at some distance\r\n      could one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All the artful\r\n      maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and\r\n      a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable aim was to\r\n      shorten those marches. To that end Kutúzov’s activity was directed during\r\n      the whole campaign from Moscow to Vílna—not casually or\r\n      intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it.\nKutúzov felt and knew—not by reasoning or science but with the whole\r\n      of his Russian being—what every Russian soldier felt: that the\r\n      French were beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but\r\n      at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this\r\n      march, the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.\nBut to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army, who\r\n      wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some\r\n      reason to capture a king or a duke—it seemed that now—when any\r\n      battle must be horrible and senseless—was the very time to fight and\r\n      conquer somebody. Kutúzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after\r\n      another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those\r\n      soldiers—ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved—who\r\n      within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their\r\n      number, and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a\r\n      greater distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the\r\n      frontier.\nThis longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and to\r\n      cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on the\r\n      French army.\nSo it was at Krásnoe, where they expected to find one of the three French\r\n      columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen thousand\r\n      men. Despite all Kutúzov’s efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to\r\n      preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob of French soldiers by\r\n      worn-out Russians continued at Krásnoe for three days.\nToll wrote a disposition: “The first column will march to so and so,” etc.\r\n      And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition. Prince\r\n      Eugène of Württemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds that were\r\n      running past, and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive. The\r\n      French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and hid themselves in the forest\r\n      by night, making their way round as best they could, and continued their\r\n      flight.\nMilorádovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the\r\n      commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found when he\r\n      was wanted—thatchevalier sans peur et sans reproche* as he styled\r\n      himself—who was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys\r\n      demanding their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was ordered\r\n      to do.\n* Knight without fear and without reproach.\n“I give you that column, lads,” he said, riding up to the troops and\r\n      pointing out the French to the cavalry.\nAnd the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could\r\n      scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented to them—that\r\n      is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold, frost-bitten, and\r\n      starving—and the column that had been presented to them threw down\r\n      its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do.\nAt Krásnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several hundred\r\n      cannon, and a stick called a “marshal’s staff,” and disputed as to who had\r\n      distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement—though\r\n      they much regretted not having taken Napoleon, or at least a marshal or a\r\n      hero of some sort, and reproached one another and especially Kutúzov for\r\n      having failed to do so.\nThese men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the\r\n      most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and\r\n      imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed.\r\n      They blamed Kutúzov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign\r\n      he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought of nothing\r\n      but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen Factories\r\n      because he was comfortable there, that at Krásnoe he checked the advance\r\n      because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite lost his head,\r\n      and that it was probable that he had an understanding with Napoleon and\r\n      had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.\nNot only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk in\r\n      this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon asgrand,\r\n      while Kutúzov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak old\r\n      courtier, and by Russians as something indefinite—a sort of puppet\r\n      useful only because he had a Russian name."

    "text": "In 1812 and 1813 Kutúzov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor was\r\n      dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by order of the\r\n      Highest Authorities it is said that Kutúzov was a cunning court liar,\r\n      frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at Krásnoe\r\n      and the Berëzina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of complete\r\n      victory over the French. *\n*History of the year 1812. The character of Kutúzov and\r\n     reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at\r\n     Krásnoe, by Bogdánovich.\nSuch is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind\r\n      does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals\r\n      who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their personal will to it.\r\n      The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning the\r\n      higher laws.\nFor Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon—that\r\n      most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile,\r\n      showed human dignity—Napoleon is the object of adulation and\r\n      enthusiasm; he isgrand. But Kutúzov—the man who from the beginning\r\n      to the end of his activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed\r\n      from Borodinó to Vílna, presented an example exceptional in history of\r\n      self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of\r\n      what was happening—Kutúzov seems to them something indefinite and\r\n      pitiful, and when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a\r\n      little ashamed.\nAnd yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity\r\n      was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be difficult to\r\n      imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole\r\n      people. Still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of\r\n      the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as\r\n      that to which all Kutúzov’s efforts were directed in 1812.\nKutúzov never talked of “forty centuries looking down from the Pyramids,”\r\n       of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of what he intended to\r\n      accomplish or had accomplished; in general he said nothing about himself,\r\n      adopted no pose, always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of\r\n      men, and said the simplest and most ordinary things. He wrote letters to\r\n      his daughters and to Madame de Staël, read novels, liked the society of\r\n      pretty women, jested with generals, officers, and soldiers, and never\r\n      contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him. When Count\r\n      Rostopchín at the Yaúza bridge galloped up to Kutúzov with personal\r\n      reproaches for having caused the destruction of Moscow, and said: “How was\r\n      it you promised not to abandon Moscow without a battle?” Kutúzov replied:\r\n      “And I shall not abandon Moscow without a battle,” though Moscow was then\r\n      already abandoned. When Arakchéev, coming to him from the Emperor, said\r\n      that Ermólov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery, Kutúzov\r\n      replied: “Yes, I was just saying so myself,” though a moment before he had\r\n      said quite the contrary. What did it matter to him—who then alone\r\n      amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of\r\n      what was happening—what did it matter to him whether Rostopchín\r\n      attributed the calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could\r\n      it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery.\nNot merely in these cases but continually did that old man—who by\r\n      experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words\r\n      serving as their expression are not what move people—use quite\r\n      meaningless words that happened to enter his head.\nBut that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole time\r\n      of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward\r\n      which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of himself, in\r\n      very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with\r\n      the bitter conviction that he would not be understood. Beginning with the\r\n      battle of Borodinó, from which time his disagreement with those about him\r\n      began, he alone said thatthe battle of Borodinó was a victory, and\r\n      repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the\r\n      time of his death. He alone said thatthe loss of Moscow is not the loss\r\n      of Russia. In reply to Lauriston’s proposal of peace, he said:There can\r\n      be no peace, for such is the people’s will. He alone during the retreat of\r\n      the French said thatall our maneuvers are useless, everything is being\r\n      accomplished of itself better than we could desire; that the enemy must be\r\n      offered “a golden bridge”; thatneither the Tarútino, the Vyázma, nor the\r\n      Krásnoe battles were necessary; thatwe must keep some force to reach the\r\n      frontier with,and thathe would not sacrifice a single Russian for ten\r\n      Frenchmen.\nAnd this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakchéev to\r\n      please the Emperor, he alone—incurring thereby the Emperor’s\r\n      displeasure—said in Vílna thatto carry the war beyond the frontier\r\n      is useless and harmful.\nNor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the\r\n      events. His actions—without the smallest deviation—were all\r\n      directed to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength\r\n      for conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them\r\n      out of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people\r\n      and of our army.\nThis procrastinator Kutúzov, whose motto was “Patience and Time,” this\r\n      enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodinó, investing the\r\n      preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kutúzov who before\r\n      the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in\r\n      contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodinó was\r\n      a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and\r\n      despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle\r\n      was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat insisted that\r\n      battles, which were useless then, should not be fought, and that a new war\r\n      should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia crossed.\nIt is easy now to understand the significance of these events—if\r\n      only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that\r\n      existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals—for the events and\r\n      results now lie before us.\nBut how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion, so\r\n      truly discern the importance of the people’s view of the events that in\r\n      all his activity he was never once untrue to it?\nThe source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the\r\n      events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in\r\n      full purity and strength.\nOnly the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the\r\n      people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar’s wish, to select him—an\r\n      old man in disfavor—to be their representative in the national war.\r\n      And only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which\r\n      he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers not to slaying and\r\n      destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them.\nThat simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be cast\r\n      in the false mold of a European hero—the supposed ruler of men—that\r\n      history has invented.\nTo a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of\r\n      greatness."

    "text": "The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of\r\n      Krásnoe. Toward evening—after much disputing and many mistakes made\r\n      by generals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had\r\n      been sent about with counterorders—when it had become plain that the\r\n      enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no\r\n      battle, Kutúzov left Krásnoe and went to Dóbroe whither his headquarters\r\n      had that day been transferred.\nThe day was clear and frosty. Kutúzov rode to Dóbroe on his plump little\r\n      white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who\r\n      whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the road groups of\r\n      French prisoners captured that day (there were seven thousand of them)\r\n      were crowding to warm themselves at campfires. Near Dóbroe an immense\r\n      crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in\r\n      anything they had been able to get hold of, were standing in the road\r\n      beside a long row of unharnessed French guns. At the approach of the\r\n      commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on\r\n      Kutúzov who, wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat\r\n      that bulged on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his\r\n      white horse. One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and\r\n      prisoners had been captured.\nKutúzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was\r\n      saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed\r\n      attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially\r\n      wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses\r\n      and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and festering eyes.\nOne group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them, one of\r\n      whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of raw flesh\r\n      with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting\r\n      glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent expression with\r\n      which, after a glance at Kutúzov, the soldier with the sores immediately\r\n      turned away and went on with what he was doing.\nKutúzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He puckered his\r\n      face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another spot\r\n      he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the\r\n      shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and Kutúzov with\r\n      the same expression on his face again swayed his head.\n“What were you saying?” he asked the general, who continuing his report\r\n      directed the commander in chief’s attention to some standards captured\r\n      from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhénsk regiment.\n“Ah, the standards!” said Kutúzov, evidently detaching himself with\r\n      difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.\nHe looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at him from\r\n      all sides awaiting a word from him.\nHe stopped in front of the Preobrazhénsk regiment, sighed deeply, and\r\n      closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the\r\n      standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them.\r\n      Kutúzov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident\r\n      reluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head and began\r\n      to speak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He looked attentively\r\n      around at the circle of officers, recognizing several of them.\n“I thank you all!” he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the\r\n      officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were\r\n      distinctly heard. “I thank you all for your hard and faithful service. The\r\n      victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you forever.”\nHe paused and looked around.\n“Lower its head, lower it!” he said to a soldier who had accidentally\r\n      lowered the French eagle he was holding before the Preobrazhénsk\r\n      standards. “Lower, lower, that’s it. Hurrah lads!” he added, addressing\r\n      the men with a rapid movement of his chin.\n“Hur-r-rah!” roared thousands of voices.\nWhile the soldiers were shouting Kutúzov leaned forward in his saddle and\r\n      bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic\r\n      gleam.\n“You see, brothers...” said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at\r\n      once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no longer\r\n      the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell\r\n      his comrades something very important.\nThere was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the\r\n      soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say.\n“You see, brothers, I know it’s hard for you, but it can’t be helped! Bear\r\n      up; it won’t be for long now! We’ll see our visitors off and then we’ll\r\n      rest. The Tsar won’t forget your service. It is hard for you, but still\r\n      you are at home while they—you see what they have come to,” said he,\r\n      pointing to the prisoners. “Worse off than our poorest beggars. While they\r\n      were strong we didn’t spare ourselves, but now we may even pity them. They\r\n      are human beings too. Isn’t it so, lads?”\nHe looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed upon\r\n      him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew brighter and\r\n      brighter with an old man’s mild smile, which drew the corners of his lips\r\n      and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed his head\r\n      as if in perplexity.\n“But after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody\r\n      bastards!” he cried, suddenly lifting his head.\nAnd flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during\r\n      the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing\r\n      joyfully and shouting “Hurrah!”\nKutúzov’s words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could have\r\n      repeated the field marshal’s address, begun solemnly and then changing\r\n      into an old man’s simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that\r\n      speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe and\r\n      consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that old\r\n      man’s good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay in the\r\n      soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and\r\n      long-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one of the generals addressed\r\n      Kutúzov asking whether he wished hiscalècheto be sent for, Kutúzov in\r\n      answering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved."

    "text": "When the troops reached their night’s halting place on the eighth of\r\n      November, the last day of the Krásnoe battles, it was already growing\r\n      dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling\r\n      snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the falling snow a\r\n      purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener.\nAn infantry regiment which had left Tarútino three thousand strong but now\r\n      numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at\r\n      its halting place—a village on the highroad. The quartermasters who\r\n      met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead\r\n      Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff. There was only one hut\r\n      available for the regimental commander.\nThe commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the village\r\n      and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.\nLike some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its lair\r\n      and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep through the\r\n      snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and immediately the\r\n      sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches, and merry voices could\r\n      be heard from there. Another section amid the regimental wagons and horses\r\n      which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye\r\n      biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third section scattered through the\r\n      village arranging quarters for the staff officers, carrying out the French\r\n      corpses that were in the huts, and dragging away boards, dry wood, and\r\n      thatch from the roofs, for the campfires, or wattle fences to serve for\r\n      shelter.\nSome fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall\r\n      of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.\n“Now then, all together—shove!” cried the voices, and the huge\r\n      surface of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen\r\n      swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked more and more\r\n      and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had been pushing it.\r\n      Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.\n“Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That’s\r\n      it.... Where are you shoving to?”\n“Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!”\nAll stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to sing. At the\r\n      end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty voices roared\r\n      out at once: “Oo-oo-oo-oo! That’s it. All together! Heave away, boys!...”\r\n       but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved, and in the\r\n      silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible.\n“Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand... will\r\n      you? You may want us one of these days.”\nSome twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into the\r\n      village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about\r\n      thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the village\r\n      street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping\r\n      men.\n“Get along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....”\nMerry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.\n“What are you up to?” suddenly came the authoritative voice of a sergeant\r\n      major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden. “There are\r\n      gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you foul-mouthed\r\n      devils, you brutes, I’ll give it to you!” shouted he, hitting the first\r\n      man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back. “Can’t you make less\r\n      noise?”\nThe men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped\r\n      his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the\r\n      wattle.\n“There, how that devil hits out! He’s made my face all bloody,” said he in\r\n      a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.\n“Don’t you like it?” said a laughing voice, and moderating their tones the\r\n      men moved forward.\nWhen they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as\r\n      before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.\nIn the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered and\r\n      were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the\r\n      maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a flank march to\r\n      the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture him.\nBy the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the\r\n      campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood crackled,\r\n      the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all\r\n      over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden down.\nAxes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without any\r\n      orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night, shelters\r\n      were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being boiled, and muskets\r\n      and accouterments put in order.\nThe wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the\r\n      Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests,\r\n      and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo, called the roll,\r\n      had supper, and settled down round the fires for the night—some\r\n      repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some stripping\r\n      themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts."

    "text": "One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched\r\n      conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time—lacking warm\r\n      boots and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the snow\r\n      with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations (the\r\n      commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)—they would have\r\n      presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.\nOn the contrary, the army had never under the best material conditions\r\n      presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was because all who\r\n      began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army\r\n      day by day. All the physically or morally weak had long since been left\r\n      behind and only the flower of the army—physically and mentally—remained.\nMore men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than\r\n      anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their\r\n      campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by their wattle\r\n      they demanded contributions of fuel.\n“Eh, Makéev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you lost or\r\n      have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!” shouted a red-haired and\r\n      red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but\r\n      not moving back from the fire. “And you, Jackdaw, go and fetch some wood!”\r\n       said he to another soldier.\nThis red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being\r\n      robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier they called\r\n      “Jackdaw,” a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose obediently and was\r\n      about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the\r\n      slender, handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood.\n“Bring it here—that’s fine!”\nThey split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with their\r\n      mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, making the\r\n      flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit their pipes. The\r\n      handsome young soldier who had brought the wood, setting his arms akimbo,\r\n      began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he\r\n      stood.\n“Mother! The dew is cold but clear.... It’s well that I’m a musketeer...”\r\n       he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.\n“Look out, your soles will fly off!” shouted the red-haired man, noticing\r\n      that the sole of the dancer’s boot was hanging loose. “What a fellow you\r\n      are for dancing!”\nThe dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw it on\r\n      the fire.\n“Right enough, friend,” said he, and, having sat down, took out of his\r\n      knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his foot.\r\n      “It’s the steam that spoils them,” he added, stretching out his feet\r\n      toward the fire.\n“They’ll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when we’ve\r\n      finished hammeringthem, we’re to receive double kits!”\n“And that son of a bitch Petróv has lagged behind after all, it seems,”\r\n       said one sergeant major.\n“I’ve had an eye on him this long while,” said the other.\n“Well, he’s a poor sort of soldier....”\n“But in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday.”\n“Yes, it’s all very well, but when a man’s feet are frozen how can he\r\n      walk?”\n“Eh? Don’t talk nonsense!” said a sergeant major.\n“Do you want to be doing the same?” said an old soldier, turning\r\n      reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.\n“Well, you know,” said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a\r\n      squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the fire,\r\n      “a plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it’s death. Take me, now! I’ve\r\n      got no strength left,” he added, with sudden resolution turning to the\r\n      sergeant major. “Tell them to send me to hospital; I’m aching all over;\r\n      anyway I shan’t be able to keep up.”\n“That’ll do, that’ll do!” replied the sergeant major quietly.\nThe soldier said no more and the talk went on.\n“What a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is that not\r\n      one of them had what you might call real boots on,” said a soldier,\r\n      starting a new theme. “They were no more than make-believes.”\n“The Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for the\r\n      colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,” put in\r\n      the dancer. “As they turned them over one seemed still alive and, would\r\n      you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo.”\n“But they’re a clean folk, lads,” the first man went on; “he was white—as\r\n      white as birchbark—and some of them are such fine fellows, you might\r\n      think they were nobles.”\n“Well, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there.”\n“But they don’t understand our talk at all,” said the dancer with a\r\n      puzzled smile. “I asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in his\r\n      own way. A queer lot!”\n“But it’s strange, friends,” continued the man who had wondered at their\r\n      whiteness, “the peasants at Mozháysk were saying that when they began\r\n      burying the dead—where the battle was you know—well, those\r\n      dead had been lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, ‘they\r\n      lie as white as paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder\r\n      smoke.’”\n“Was it from the cold?” asked someone.\n“You’re a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it had\r\n      been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. ‘But,’ he says, ‘go\r\n      up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,’ he says, ‘we tie our\r\n      faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off: we\r\n      can hardly do it. But theirs,’ he says, ‘are white as paper and not so\r\n      much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.’”\nAll were silent.\n“It must be from their food,” said the sergeant major. “They used to\r\n      gobble the same food as the gentry.”\nNo one contradicted him.\n“That peasant near Mozháysk where the battle was said the men were all\r\n      called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and\r\n      still didn’t finish carting the dead away. And as for the wolves, he\r\n      says...”\n“That was a real battle,” said an old soldier. “It’s the only one worth\r\n      remembering; but since that... it’s only been tormenting folk.”\n“And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and, my\r\n      word, they didn’t let us get near before they just threw down their\r\n      muskets and went on their knees. ‘Pardon!’ they say. That’s only one case.\r\n      They say Plátov took ‘Poleon himself twice. But he didn’t know the right\r\n      charm. He catches him and catches him—no good! He turns into a bird\r\n      in his hands and flies away. And there’s no way of killing him either.”\n“You’re a first-class liar, Kiselëv, when I come to look at you!”\n“Liar, indeed! It’s the real truth.”\n“If he fell into my hands, when I’d caught him I’d bury him in the ground\r\n      with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he’s ruined!”\n“Well, anyhow we’re going to end it. He won’t come here again,” remarked\r\n      the old soldier, yawning.\nThe conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to sleep.\n“Look at the stars. It’s wonderful how they shine! You would think the\r\n      women had spread out their linen,” said one of the men, gazing with\r\n      admiration at the Milky Way.\n“That’s a sign of a good harvest next year.”\n“We shall want some more wood.”\n“You warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That’s queer.”\n“O Lord!”\n“What are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how he’s\r\n      sprawling!”\nIn the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen asleep\r\n      could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now and again\r\n      exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound\r\n      of general, merry laughter.\n“Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!” said one of the\r\n      soldiers, “and what a lot of them there are!”\nOne of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.\n“They’re having such fun,” said he, coming back. “Two Frenchies have\r\n      turned up. One’s quite frozen and the other’s an awful swaggerer. He’s\r\n      singing songs....”\n“Oh, I’ll go across and have a look....”\nAnd several of the men went over to the Fifth Company."

    "text": "The Fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest. A huge\r\n      campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the\r\n      branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.\nAbout midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest,\r\n      and the crackling of dry branches.\n“A bear, lads,” said one of the men.\nThey all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into the\r\n      bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one\r\n      another.\nThese were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They came up\r\n      to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did\r\n      not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officer’s hat\r\n      and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to\r\n      sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied\r\n      round his head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said something,\r\n      pointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen, spread a\r\n      greatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some buckwheat\r\n      porridge and vodka for both of them.\nThe exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head\r\n      wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.\nWhen Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he\r\n      suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the\r\n      soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and resting\r\n      his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at the\r\n      Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted a\r\n      long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel, pointing to his\r\n      shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was an\r\n      officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer who had come up to the\r\n      fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French officer\r\n      into his hut to warm him, and when the messenger returned and said that\r\n      the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him, Ramballe was told to\r\n      go. He rose and tried to walk, but staggered and would have fallen had not\r\n      a soldier standing by held him up.\n“You won’t do it again, eh?” said one of the soldiers, winking and turning\r\n      mockingly to Ramballe.\n“Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are—a real peasant!”\r\n       came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.\nThey surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two soldiers,\r\n      and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around their necks while\r\n      they carried him and began wailing plaintively:\n“Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh, my brave,\r\n      kind friends,” and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the\r\n      men like a child.\nMeanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by\r\n      the soldiers.\nMorel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes, was\r\n      wearing a woman’s cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head\r\n      over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a French song in a\r\n      hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier. The\r\n      soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him.\n“Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! I’ll soon pick it up. How is\r\n      it?” said the man—a singer and a wag—whom Morel was embracing.\n“Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!”sang Morel,\r\n      winking.“Ce diable à quatre...”*\n* “Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy\r\n     devil.”\n“Vivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!” repeated the soldier, flourishing\r\n      his arm and really catching the tune.\n“Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!” rose their rough, joyous laughter from all sides.\nMorel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.\n“Well, go on, go on!”\n“Qui eut le triple talent,De boire, de battre,Et d’être un vert galant.”*\n* Who had a triple talentFor drinking, for fighting,And for being a gallant old boy...\n“It goes smoothly, too. Well, now, Zaletáev!”\n“Ke...” Zaletáev, brought out with effort: “ke-e-e-e,” he drawled,\r\n      laboriously pursing his lips, “le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e\r\n      de-tra-va-ga-la” he sang.\n“Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?”\n“Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after\r\n      starving.”\nThey gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on his\r\n      third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him. The\r\n      older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such\r\n      nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one would\r\n      occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a smile.\n“They are men too,” said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his coat.\r\n      “Even wormwood grows on its own root.”\n“O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard\r\n      frost....”\nThey all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking at\r\n      them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring up, now\r\n      vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something gladsome and\r\n      mysterious to one another."

    "text": "The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical\r\n      progression; and that crossing of the Berëzina about which so much has\r\n      been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and not\r\n      at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been and still\r\n      is written about the Berëzina, on the French side this is only because at\r\n      the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been\r\n      previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic\r\n      spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the Russian side merely\r\n      because in Petersburg—far from the seat of war—a plan (again\r\n      one of Pfuel’s) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a strategic trap at\r\n      the Berëzina River. Everyone assured himself that all would happen\r\n      according to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of\r\n      the Berëzina that destroyed the French army. In reality the results of the\r\n      crossing were much less disastrous to the French—in guns and men\r\n      lost—than Krásnoe had been, as the figures show.\nThe sole importance of the crossing of the Berëzina lies in the fact that\r\n      it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting\r\n      off the enemy’s retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of\r\n      action—the one Kutúzov and the general mass of the army demanded—namely,\r\n      simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled at a continually\r\n      increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal. It\r\n      fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path. This\r\n      was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what\r\n      took place at the bridges. When the bridges broke down, unarmed soldiers,\r\n      people from Moscow and women with children who were with the French\r\n      transport, all—carried on byvis inertiæ—pressed forward into\r\n      boats and into the ice-covered water and did not surrender.\nThat impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of pursuers\r\n      was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own people each might\r\n      hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held among them.\r\n      But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same pitiful plight,\r\n      would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life. The\r\n      French did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisoners—with\r\n      whom the Russians did not know what to do—perished of cold and\r\n      hunger despite their captors’ desire to save them; they felt that it could\r\n      not be otherwise. The most compassionate Russian commanders, those\r\n      favorable to the French—and even the Frenchmen in the Russian\r\n      service—could do nothing for the prisoners. The French perished from\r\n      the conditions to which the Russian army was itself exposed. It was\r\n      impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable\r\n      soldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful, or hated, or\r\n      guilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that, but they\r\n      were exceptions.\nCertain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope.\r\n      Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective\r\n      flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.\nThe farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the remnant,\r\n      especially after the Berëzina, on which (in consequence of the Petersburg\r\n      plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and the keener grew\r\n      the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed one another and Kutúzov\r\n      most of all. Anticipation that the failure of the Petersburg Berëzina plan\r\n      would be attributed to Kutúzov led to dissatisfaction, contempt, and\r\n      ridicule, more and more strongly expressed. The ridicule and contempt were\r\n      of course expressed in a respectful form, making it impossible for him to\r\n      ask wherein he was to blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when\r\n      reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling\r\n      a regrettable formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to\r\n      mislead him at every turn.\nBecause they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was\r\n      useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the profundity\r\n      of their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which they thought\r\n      were mere phrases) about a “golden bridge,” about the impossibility of\r\n      crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions, and so forth. They\r\n      had heard all that before. And all he said—that it was necessary to\r\n      await provisions, or that the men had no boots—was so simple, while\r\n      what they proposed was so complicated and clever, that it was evident that\r\n      he was old and stupid and that they, though not in power, were commanders\r\n      of genius.\nAfter the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg\r\n      hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their\r\n      maximum. Kutúzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n      Only once, after the affair of the Berëzina, did he get angry and write to\r\n      Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following letter:\n“On account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please be\r\n      so good as to set off for Kalúga on receipt of this, and there await\r\n      further commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty.”\nBut after Bennigsen’s departure, the Grand Duke Tsarévich Constantine\r\n      Pávlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the beginning of the\r\n      campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by Kutúzov. Now\r\n      having come to the army, he informed Kutúzov of the Emperor’s displeasure\r\n      at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance. The\r\n      Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days’ time.\nThe old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs—this\r\n      same Kutúzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief against the\r\n      sovereign’s wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and heir-apparent\r\n      from the army—who on his own authority and contrary to the Emperor’s\r\n      will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now realized at once that\r\n      his day was over, that his part was played, and that the power he was\r\n      supposed to hold was no longer his. And he understood this not merely from\r\n      the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the military\r\n      business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his\r\n      mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to be conscious of\r\n      the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical\r\n      rest.\nOn the twenty-ninth of November Kutúzov entered Vílna—his “dear\r\n      Vílna” as he called it. Twice during his career Kutúzov had been governor\r\n      of Vílna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old\r\n      friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had so\r\n      long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army and\r\n      state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,\r\n      immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been\r\n      accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be\r\n      done in the realm of history did not concern him at all.\nChichagóv, one of the most zealous “cutters-off” and “breakers-up,” who\r\n      had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but\r\n      never wished to go where he was sent: Chichagóv, noted for the boldness\r\n      with which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered Kutúzov to be under\r\n      an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with Turkey in\r\n      1811 independently of Kutúzov, and found that peace had already been\r\n      concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of securing that\r\n      peace was really Kutúzov’s; this Chichagóv was the first to meet Kutúzov\r\n      at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress naval uniform, with\r\n      a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he handed Kutúzov a garrison\r\n      report and the keys of the town. The contemptuously respectful attitude of\r\n      the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest\r\n      degree by the behavior of Chichagóv, who knew of the accusations that were\r\n      being directed against Kutúzov.\nWhen speaking to Chichagóv, Kutúzov incidentally mentioned that the\r\n      vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Borísov had\r\n      been recovered and would be restored to him.\n“You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the contrary,\r\n      I can supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties,”\r\n       warmly replied Chichagóv, who tried by every word he spoke to prove his\r\n      own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutúzov to be animated by the same\r\n      desire.\nKutúzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating\r\n      smile: “I meant merely to say what I said.”\nContrary to the Emperor’s wish Kutúzov detained the greater part of the\r\n      army at Vílna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack\r\n      and physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army\r\n      affairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting\r\n      the Emperor’s arrival led a dissipated life.\nHaving left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite—Count\r\n      Tolstóy, Prince Volkónski, Arakchéev, and others—the Emperor reached\r\n      Vílna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the\r\n      castle. In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff\r\n      officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle, as well as a\r\n      guard of honor of the Semënov regiment.\nA courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with three\r\n      foam-flecked horses, shouted “Coming!” and Konovnítsyn rushed into the\r\n      vestibule to inform Kutúzov, who was waiting in the hall porter’s little\r\n      lodge.\nA minute later the old man’s large stout figure in full-dress uniform, his\r\n      chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach, waddled out\r\n      into the porch. He put on his hat with its peaks to the sides and, holding\r\n      his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps\r\n      to the level of the street, took in his hand the report he had prepared\r\n      for the Emperor.\nThere was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew furiously\r\n      up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the\r\n      figures of the Emperor and Volkónski could already be descried.\nFrom the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect\r\n      on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over,\r\n      readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and, at\r\n      the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh, lifted\r\n      his eyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his smooth,\r\n      ingratiating voice.\nThe Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutúzov from head to foot, frowned\r\n      for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man,\r\n      extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too, owing to a\r\n      long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings, had its usual\r\n      effect on Kutúzov and he gave a sob.\nThe Emperor greeted the officers and the Semënov guard, and again pressing\r\n      the old man’s hand went with him into the castle.\nWhen alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his\r\n      dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at\r\n      Krásnoe and the Berëzina, and informed him of his intentions for a future\r\n      campaign abroad. Kutúzov made no rejoinder or remark. The same submissive,\r\n      expressionless look with which he had listened to the Emperor’s commands\r\n      on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now.\nWhen Kutúzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the\r\n      ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someone’s voice\r\n      saying:\n“Your Serene Highness!”\nKutúzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of Count\r\n      Tolstóy, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small\r\n      object. Kutúzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him.\nSuddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed\r\n      across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the object\r\n      that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the First Class."

    "text": "Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor\r\n      honored by his presence. Kutúzov had received the Order of St. George of\r\n      the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors, but\r\n      everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties\r\n      were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example, but\r\n      everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and\r\n      good-for-nothing. When Kutúzov, conforming to a custom of Catherine’s day,\r\n      ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the\r\n      Emperor’s feet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face\r\n      and muttered something in which some people caught the words, “the old\r\n      comedian.”\nThe Emperor’s displeasure with Kutúzov was specially increased at Vílna by\r\n      the fact that Kutúzov evidently could not or would not understand the\r\n      importance of the coming campaign.\nWhen on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled\r\n      about him: “You have not only saved Russia, you have saved Europe!” they\r\n      all understood that the war was not ended.\nKutúzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no\r\n      fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia, but\r\n      could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had gained.\r\n      He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying fresh\r\n      troops, spoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of the\r\n      possibility of failure and so forth.\nThis being the field marshal’s frame of mind he was naturally regarded as\r\n      merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.\nTo avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural method was to\r\n      do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at the\r\n      beginning of the Russian campaign—to transfer the authority to the\r\n      Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the commander in\r\n      chief’s feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change.\nWith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real\r\n      strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konovnítsyn, and\r\n      Ermólov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field\r\n      marshal’s great weakness and failing health.\nHis health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to\r\n      another. And in fact his health was poor.\nSo naturally, simply, and gradually—just as he had come from Turkey\r\n      to the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to the army\r\n      when he was needed there—now when his part was played out, Kutúzov’s\r\n      place was taken by a new and necessary performer.\nThe war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every Russian\r\n      heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.\nThe movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a\r\n      movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another\r\n      leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from Kutúzov’s\r\n      and animated by different motives.\nAlexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to\r\n      west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kutúzov had been for\r\n      the salvation and glory of Russia.\nKutúzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or Napoleon\r\n      meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of the Russian\r\n      people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had been liberated\r\n      and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing left to do as a\r\n      Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of the national war but\r\n      to die, and Kutúzov died."

    "text": "As generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical\r\n      privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were\r\n      over. After his liberation he reached Orël, and on the third day there,\r\n      when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up for three\r\n      months. He had what the doctors termed “bilious fever.” But despite the\r\n      fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him medicines to\r\n      drink, he recovered.\nScarcely any impression was left on Pierre’s mind by all that happened to\r\n      him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered only the\r\n      dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical distress, and\r\n      pains in his feet and side. He remembered a general impression of the\r\n      misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity\r\n      of officers and generals who questioned him, he also remembered his\r\n      difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses, and above all he\r\n      remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time. On the day of\r\n      his rescue he had seen the body of Pétya Rostóv. That same day he had\r\n      learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of Borodinó for\r\n      more than a month had recently died in the Rostóvs’ house at Yaroslávl,\r\n      and Denísov who told him this news also mentioned Hélène’s death,\r\n      supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at the time\r\n      seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its\r\n      significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as\r\n      possible from places where people were killing one another, to some\r\n      peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over all\r\n      the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orël he immediately\r\n      fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance\r\n      on him two of his servants, Terénty and Váska, who had come from Moscow;\r\n      and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been living on his estate\r\n      at Eléts and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him.\nIt was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the\r\n      impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got\r\n      used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow,\r\n      that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he would be sure\r\n      to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in his dreams he\r\n      still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the same way little\r\n      by little he came to understand the news he had been told after his\r\n      rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the\r\n      destruction of the French.\nA joyous feeling of freedom—that complete inalienable freedom\r\n      natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside\r\n      Moscow—filled Pierre’s soul during his convalescence. He was\r\n      surprised to find that this inner freedom, which was independent of\r\n      external conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of external\r\n      liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances. No one\r\n      demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere. He had all he wanted: the\r\n      thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no\r\n      longer there, since she was no more.\n“Oh, how good! How splendid!” said he to himself when a cleanly laid table\r\n      was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down for the\r\n      night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the French had gone\r\n      and that his wife was no more. “Oh, how good, how splendid!”\nAnd by old habit he asked himself the question: “Well, and what then? What\r\n      am I going to do?” And he immediately gave himself the answer: “Well, I\r\n      shall live. Ah, how splendid!”\nThe very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he had\r\n      continually sought to find—the aim of life—no longer existed\r\n      for him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared\r\n      temporarily—he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not\r\n      present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the\r\n      complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this\r\n      time.\nHe could not see an aim, for he now had faith—not faith in any kind\r\n      of rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever-manifest\r\n      God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for an\r\n      aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity he had\r\n      learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had\r\n      told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere. In his captivity he\r\n      had learned that in Karatáev God was greater, more infinite and\r\n      unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the\r\n      Freemasons. He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into\r\n      the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet. All his life he\r\n      had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should have\r\n      merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.\nIn the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinitesomething. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked\r\n      for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had seen only what was\r\n      limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had equipped himself with a\r\n      mental telescope and looked into remote space, where petty worldliness\r\n      hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite\r\n      merely because it was not clearly seen. And such had European life,\r\n      politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and philanthropy seemed to him. But\r\n      even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted them, his mind had\r\n      penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness,\r\n      worldliness, and senselessness. Now, however, he had learned to see the\r\n      great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and therefore—to see it\r\n      and enjoy its contemplation—he naturally threw away the telescope\r\n      through which he had till now gazed over men’s heads, and gladly regarded\r\n      the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and infinite life around\r\n      him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became. That\r\n      dreadful question, “What for?” which had formerly destroyed all his mental\r\n      edifices, no longer existed for him. To that question, “What for?” a\r\n      simple answer was now always ready in his soul: “Because there is a God,\r\n      that God without whose will not one hair falls from a man’s head.”"

    "text": "In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he was\r\n      just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed\r\n      occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of\r\n      his own. The difference between his former and present self was that\r\n      formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him, he\r\n      had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish\r\n      something at a distance. At present he still forgot what was said to him\r\n      and still did not see what was before his eyes, but he now looked with a\r\n      scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and\r\n      listened to what was said, though evidently seeing and hearing something\r\n      quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy\r\n      man, and so people had been inclined to avoid him. Now a smile at the joy\r\n      of life always played round his lips, and sympathy for others shone in\r\n      his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as\r\n      he was, and people felt pleased by his presence.\nPreviously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and\r\n      seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew\r\n      how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets.\nThe princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly hostile\r\n      to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old\r\n      count’s death, now after staying a short time in Orël—where she had\r\n      come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she\r\n      considered it her duty to nurse him—felt to her surprise and\r\n      vexation that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek\r\n      her approval, he merely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt\r\n      that he regarded her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into\r\n      herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side\r\n      of her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most\r\n      intimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards\r\n      gratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.\nThe most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more\r\n      successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing\r\n      sympathy with them. Yet Pierre’s cunning consisted simply in finding\r\n      pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered, hard, and\r\n      (in her own way) proud princess.\n“Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of\r\n      bad people but of people such as myself,” thought she.\nHis servants too—Terénty and Váska—in their own way noticed\r\n      the change that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had\r\n      become much “simpler.” Terénty, when he had helped him undress and wished\r\n      him good night, often lingered with his master’s boots in his hands and\r\n      clothes over his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. And\r\n      Pierre, noticing that Terénty wanted a chat, generally kept him there.\n“Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?” he would ask.\nAnd Terénty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of the\r\n      old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and\r\n      talking, or sometimes listening to Pierre’s stories, and then would go out\r\n      into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and\r\n      affection for him.\nThe doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he\r\n      considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was\r\n      of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre telling\r\n      him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his\r\n      patients in general, and especially of the ladies.\n“It’s a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our\r\n      provincials,” he would say.\nThere were several prisoners from the French army in Orël, and the doctor\r\n      brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.\nThis officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of\r\n      the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.\nThe Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk with\r\n      him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love, and pour out\r\n      to him his indignation against the French and especially against Napoleon.\n“If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight such\r\n      a nation,” he said to Pierre. “You, who have suffered so from the French,\r\n      do not even feel animosity toward them.”\nPierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by\r\n      evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.\nDuring the last days of Pierre’s stay in Orël his old Masonic acquaintance\r\n      Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807, came to see\r\n      him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who had a large estate in\r\n      Orël province, and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat\r\n      department in that town.\nHearing that Bezúkhov was in Orël, Willarski, though they had never been\r\n      intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that\r\n      people who meet in a desert generally express for one another. Willarski\r\n      felt dull in Orël and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and, as\r\n      he supposed, of similar interests.\nBut to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much\r\n      behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into apathy\r\n      and egotism.\n“You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,” he said.\nBut for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been\r\n      formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as he\r\n      looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that he\r\n      had been like that himself but a short time before.\nWillarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,\r\n      his wife’s affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these\r\n      occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all\r\n      contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family.\r\n      Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests continually\r\n      absorbed his attention. And Pierre, without trying to change the other’s\r\n      views and without condemning him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused\r\n      smile now habitual to him, was interested in this strange though very\r\n      familiar phenomenon.\nThere was a new feature in Pierre’s relations with Willarski, with the\r\n      princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which\r\n      gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of the\r\n      impossibility of changing a man’s convictions by words, and his\r\n      recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing\r\n      things each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of\r\n      each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a\r\n      basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other\r\n      people. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between\r\n      men’s opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased\r\n      him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.\nIn practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of\r\n      gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions,\r\n      especially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man, he\r\n      was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and\r\n      perplexity. “To give or not to give?” he had asked himself. “I have it and\r\n      he needs it. But someone else needs it still more. Who needs it most? And\r\n      perhaps they are both impostors?” In the old days he had been unable to\r\n      find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as\r\n      long as he had anything to give. Formerly he had been in a similar state\r\n      of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his property, when\r\n      one person advised one thing and another something else.\nNow to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or\r\n      perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a judge who by\r\n      some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.\nHe was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt\r\n      certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first time he had\r\n      recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel, came to\r\n      him and, after talking a great deal about his exploits, concluded by\r\n      making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give him four thousand\r\n      francs to send to his wife and children. Pierre refused without the least\r\n      difficulty or effort, and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had\r\n      been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult. At the same time\r\n      that he refused the colonel’s demand he made up his mind that he must have\r\n      recourse to artifice when leaving Orël, to induce the Italian officer to\r\n      accept some money of which he was evidently in need. A further proof to\r\n      Pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished\r\n      by his decision with regard to his wife’s debts and to the rebuilding of\r\n      his houses in and near Moscow.\nHis head steward came to him at Orël and Pierre reckoned up with him his\r\n      diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the\r\n      head steward’s calculation, about two million rubles.\nTo console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate\r\n      showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but\r\n      would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife’s debts which he was\r\n      under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Moscow house and the\r\n      country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty thousand\r\n      rubles a year and brought in nothing.\n“Yes, of course that’s true,” said Pierre with a cheerful smile. “I don’t\r\n      need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much richer.”\nBut in January Savélich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the\r\n      state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made of\r\n      the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this as of\r\n      a settled matter. About the same time he received letters from Prince\r\n      Vasíli and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife’s debts.\r\n      And Pierre decided that the steward’s proposals which had so pleased him\r\n      were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his wife’s affairs\r\n      and must rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he did not know, but he\r\n      knew for certain that it was necessary. His income would be reduced by\r\n      three fourths, but he felt it must be done.\nWillarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.\nDuring the whole time of his convalescence in Orël Pierre had experienced\r\n      a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his journey he found\r\n      himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces, that feeling was\r\n      intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday.\r\n      Everyone—the stagecoach driver, the post-house overseers, the\r\n      peasants on the roads and in the villages—had a new significance for\r\n      him. The presence and remarks of Willarski who continually deplored the\r\n      ignorance and poverty of Russia and its backwardness compared with Europe\r\n      only heightened Pierre’s pleasure. Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw\r\n      an extraordinary strength and vitality—the strength which in that\r\n      vast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original, peculiar,\r\n      and unique people. He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to\r\n      agree with him—an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid\r\n      discussions that could lead to nothing—and he smiled joyfully as he\r\n      listened to him."

    "text": "It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has been\r\n      destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish,\r\n      larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they jostle, overtake\r\n      one another, and fight, and it would be equally difficult to explain what\r\n      caused the Russians after the departure of the French to throng to the\r\n      place that had formerly been Moscow. But when we watch the ants round\r\n      their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and immense number of the delving\r\n      insects prove that despite the destruction of the heap, something\r\n      indestructible, which though intangible is the real strength of the\r\n      colony, still exists; and similarly, though in Moscow in the month of\r\n      October there was no government and no churches, shrines, riches, or\r\n      houses—it was still the Moscow it had been in August. All was\r\n      destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible.\nThe motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after it had\r\n      been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first for\r\n      the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in common: a\r\n      desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to apply their\r\n      activities there.\nWithin a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a\r\n      fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the\r\n      number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in 1812.\nThe first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode’s\r\n      detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents who had\r\n      fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who\r\n      entered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered it in their turn. They\r\n      continued what the French had begun. Trains of peasant carts came to\r\n      Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined\r\n      houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried off what they could to their\r\n      camps, and the householders seized all they could find in other houses and\r\n      moved it to their own, pretending that it was their property.\nBut the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent,\r\n      and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and\r\n      assumed more definite forms.\nThe French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of\r\n      regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with\r\n      luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were\r\n      lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses, market\r\n      stalls, granaries—for the most part still stocked with goods—and\r\n      there were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses filled with\r\n      luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices, churches, and\r\n      cathedrals. The longer the French remained the more these forms of town\r\n      life perished, until finally all was merged into one confused, lifeless\r\n      scene of plunder.\nThe more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the wealth\r\n      of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But plundering\r\n      by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city began, had an\r\n      opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater the number of\r\n      people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and\r\n      its regular life restored.\nBesides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by curiosity, some\r\n      by official duties, some by self-interest—house owners, clergy,\r\n      officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and peasants—streamed\r\n      into Moscow as blood flows to the heart.\nWithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off plunder\r\n      were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out of the\r\n      town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrades’ discomfiture, came\r\n      to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down one another’s prices to\r\n      below what they had been in former days. Gangs of carpenters hoping for\r\n      high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and on all sides logs were being\r\n      hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ones repaired. Tradesmen began\r\n      trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned\r\n      houses. The clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been\r\n      burned. Donors contributed Church property that had been stolen.\r\n      Government clerks set up their baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes\r\n      of documents in small rooms. The higher authorities and the police\r\n      organized the distribution of goods left behind by the French. The owners\r\n      of houses in which much property had been left, brought there from other\r\n      houses, complained of the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted\r\n      Palace in the Krémlin; others insisted that as the French had gathered\r\n      things from different houses into this or that house, it would be unfair\r\n      to allow its owner to keep all that was found there. They abused the\r\n      police and bribed them, made out estimates at ten times their value for\r\n      government stores that had perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And\r\n      Count Rostopchín wrote proclamations."

    "text": "At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of his\r\n      house which had not been burned. He called on Count Rostopchín and on some\r\n      acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he intended to leave for\r\n      Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celebrating the victory,\r\n      everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city.\r\n      Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and\r\n      everyone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly\r\n      well disposed toward them all, but was now instinctively on his guard for\r\n      fear of binding himself in any way. To all questions put to him—whether\r\n      important or quite trifling—such as: Where would he live? Was he\r\n      going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he mind taking\r\n      a parcel for someone?—he replied: “Yes, perhaps,” or, “I think so,”\r\n       and so on.\nHe had heard that the Rostóvs were at Kostromá but the thought of Natásha\r\n      seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the\r\n      distant past. He felt himself not only free from social obligations but\r\n      also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had aroused in himself.\nOn the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetskóys that\r\n      Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of\r\n      Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre’s thoughts and now recurred to him\r\n      with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary was in\r\n      Moscow and living in her house—which had not been burned—in\r\n      Vozdvízhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.\nOn his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their\r\n      friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last\r\n      one at Borodinó.\n“Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?\r\n      Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he\r\n      died?” thought Pierre. He recalled Karatáev and his death and\r\n      involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so\r\n      similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt\r\n      for both of them.\nPierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood. The\r\n      house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its general\r\n      aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a stern face as\r\n      if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had\r\n      not disturbed the order of things in the house, informed him that the\r\n      princess had gone to her own apartments, and that she received on Sundays.\n“Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,” said Pierre.\n“Yes, sir,” said the man. “Please step into the portrait gallery.”\nA few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought word\r\n      from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he would\r\n      excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.\nIn a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her\r\n      another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess\r\n      always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were like he\r\n      never knew or remembered. “This must be one of her companions,” he\r\n      thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.\nThe princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.\n“Yes,” she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand,\r\n      “so this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very last,” she\r\n      went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a shyness that\r\n      surprised him for an instant.\n“I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good news\r\n      we had received for a long time.”\nAgain the princess glanced round at her companion with even more\r\n      uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre\r\n      interrupted her.\n“Just imagine—I knew nothing about him!” said he. “I thought he had\r\n      been killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know\r\n      that he fell in with the Rostóvs.... What a strange coincidence!”\nPierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the\r\n      companion’s face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and, as\r\n      often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion in the\r\n      black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not hinder his\r\n      conversing freely with Princess Mary.\nBut when he mentioned the Rostóvs, Princess Mary’s face expressed still\r\n      greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre’s face to\r\n      that of the lady in the black dress and said:\n“Do you really not recognize her?”\nPierre looked again at the companion’s pale, delicate face with its black\r\n      eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten and\r\n      more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes.\n“But no, it can’t be!” he thought. “This stern, thin, pale face that looks\r\n      so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.” But at that\r\n      moment Princess Mary said, “Natásha!” And with difficulty, effort, and\r\n      stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges, a smile\r\n      appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from that opening door\r\n      came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with a happiness he had\r\n      long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking—especially\r\n      at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and enveloped him completely.\r\n      When she smiled doubt was no longer possible, it was Natásha and he loved\r\n      her.\nAt that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary, and\r\n      above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware. He\r\n      flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his\r\n      agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clearly—clearer\r\n      than any words could have done—did he betray to himself, to her, and\r\n      to Princess Mary that he loved her.\n“No, it’s only the unexpectedness of it,” thought Pierre. But as soon as\r\n      he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he\r\n      again glanced at Natásha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and a\r\n      still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He\r\n      became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was\r\n      saying.\nPierre had failed to notice Natásha because he did not at all expect to\r\n      see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in\r\n      her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but\r\n      that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the\r\n      moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a\r\n      suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and glanced\r\n      at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes were\r\n      kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.\nPierre’s confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natásha’s part,\r\n      but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face."

The countess is in a dreadful state;\r\n      but it was necessary for Natásha herself to see a doctor. They insisted on\r\n      her coming with me.”\n“Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?” said Pierre, addressing\r\n      Natásha. “You know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him.\r\n      What a delightful boy he was!”\nNatásha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes widened\r\n      and lit up.\n“What can one say or think of as a consolation?” said Pierre. “Nothing!\r\n      Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?”\n“Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...” remarked\r\n      Princess Mary.\n“Yes, yes, that is really true,” Pierre hastily interrupted her.\n“Why is it true?” Natásha asked, looking attentively into Pierre’s eyes.\n“How can you ask why?” said Princess Mary. “The thought alone of what\r\n      awaits...”\nNatásha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked\r\n      inquiringly at Pierre.\n“And because,” Pierre continued, “only one who believes that there is a\r\n      God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours.”\nNatásha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped. Pierre\r\n      hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary, asking\r\n      about his friend’s last days.\nPierre’s confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt\r\n      that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a\r\n      judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him\r\n      than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was considering\r\n      what impression his words would make on Natásha. He did not purposely say\r\n      things to please her, but whatever he was saying he regarded from her\r\n      standpoint.\nPrincess Mary—reluctantly as is usual in such cases—began\r\n      telling of the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But\r\n      Pierre’s face quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager restless\r\n      expression, gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to\r\n      recall for her own sake.\n“Yes, yes, and so...?” Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his\r\n      whole body and eagerly listened to her story. “Yes, yes... so he grew\r\n      tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought one thing—to\r\n      be perfectly good—so he could not be afraid of death. The faults he\r\n      had—if he had any—were not of his making. So he did soften?...\r\n      What a happy thing that he saw you again,” he added, suddenly turning to\r\n      Natásha and looking at her with eyes full of tears.\nNatásha’s face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment.\r\n      She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.\n“Yes, that was happiness,” she then said in her quiet voice with its deep\r\n      chest notes. “For me it certainly was happiness.” She paused. “And he...\r\n      he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered the\r\n      room....”\nNatásha’s voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her\r\n      knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her head\r\n      and began to speak rapidly.\n“We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to ask\r\n      about him. Then suddenly Sónya told me he was traveling with us. I had no\r\n      idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was to see\r\n      him and be with him,” she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.\nAnd not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had never\r\n      yet mentioned to anyone—all she had lived through during those three\r\n      weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslávl.\nPierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of\r\n      tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death, nor\r\n      of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only pity for her,\r\n      for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.\nPrincess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside\r\n      Natásha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her\r\n      brother’s and Natásha’s love.\nEvidently Natásha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.\nShe spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of her\r\n      soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she\r\n      repeated the same thing twice.\nDessalles’ voice was heard outside the door asking whether little Nicholas\r\n      might come in to say good night.\n“Well, that’s all—everything,” said Natásha.\nShe got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door which\r\n      was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed from the\r\n      room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.\nPierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not\r\n      understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.\nPrincess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to\r\n      her nephew who had entered the room.\nAt that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas’ face, which\r\n      resembled his father’s, affected Pierre so much that when he had kissed\r\n      the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and went to the\r\n      window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she would not let\r\n      him go.\n“No, Natásha and I sometimes don’t go to sleep till after two, so please\r\n      don’t go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately.”\nBefore Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: “This is the first\r\n      time she has talked of him like that.”"

    "text": "Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few minutes\r\n      later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with Natásha. Natásha\r\n      was calm, though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her\r\n      face. They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness\r\n      which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is impossible\r\n      to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and\r\n      yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation. They\r\n      went silently to table. The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them\r\n      up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break\r\n      the silence, looked at Natásha and at Princess Mary. They had evidently\r\n      both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with satisfaction\r\n      and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy.\n“Do you take vodka, Count?” asked Princess Mary, and those words suddenly\r\n      banished the shadows of the past. “Now tell us about yourself,” said she.\r\n      “One hears such improbable wonders about you.”\n“Yes,” replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him.\r\n      “They even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary Abrámovna\r\n      invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought to\r\n      have happened, to me. Stepán Stepánych also instructed me how I ought to\r\n      tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very easy to\r\n      be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people invite me out\r\n      and tell me all about myself.”\nNatásha smiled and was on the point of speaking.\n“We have been told,” Princess Mary interrupted her, “that you lost two\r\n      millions in Moscow. Is that true?”\n“But I am three times as rich as before,” returned Pierre.\nThough the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife’s\r\n      debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had\r\n      become three times as rich as before.\n“What I have certainly gained is freedom,” he began seriously, but did not\r\n      continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.\n“And are you building?”\n“Yes. Savélich says I must!”\n“Tell me, you did not know of the countess’ death when you decided to\r\n      remain in Moscow?” asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing\r\n      that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his words\r\n      a meaning he had perhaps not intended.\n“No,” answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning\r\n      Princess Mary had given to his words. “I heard of it in Orël and you\r\n      cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,” he\r\n      added quickly, glancing at Natásha and noticing on her face curiosity as\r\n      to how he would speak of his wife, “but her death shocked me terribly.\r\n      When two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and one’s own guilt\r\n      suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive. And\r\n      then such a death... without friends and without consolation! I am very,\r\n      very sorry for her,” he concluded, and was pleased to notice a look of\r\n      glad approval on Natásha’s face.\n“Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,” said Princess Mary.\nPierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at\r\n      Natásha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold,\r\n      stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.\n“And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?” said\r\n      Princess Mary.\nPierre laughed.\n“No, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means\r\n      being Napoleon’s guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard nothing\r\n      about him—I was in much lower company!”\nSupper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his\r\n      captivity was gradually led on to do so.\n“But it’s true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?” Natásha\r\n      asked with a slight smile. “I guessed it then when we met at the Súkharev\r\n      tower, do you remember?”\nPierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by\r\n      Princess Mary’s questions and especially by Natásha’s into giving a\r\n      detailed account of his adventures.\nAt first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him\r\n      toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came to\r\n      describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously\r\n      carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man\r\n      re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through.\nPrincess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at Natásha.\r\n      In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness. Natásha,\r\n      leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly changing with\r\n      the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never wandered—evidently\r\n      herself experiencing all that he described. Not only her look, but her\r\n      exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed Pierre that she\r\n      understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear that she understood\r\n      not only what he said but also what he wished to, but could not, express\r\n      in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident with the child and the\r\n      woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this: “It was an awful sight—children\r\n      abandoned, some in the flames... One was snatched out before my eyes...\r\n      and there were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings\r\n      torn out...” he flushed and grew confused. “Then a patrol arrived and all\r\n      the men—all those who were not looting, that is—were arrested,\r\n      and I among them.”\n“I am sure you’re not telling us everything; I am sure you did\r\n      something...” said Natásha and pausing added, “something fine?”\nPierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over\r\n      the horrible details, but Natásha insisted that he should not omit\r\n      anything.\nPierre began to tell about Karatáev, but paused. By this time he had risen\r\n      from the table and was pacing the room, Natásha following him with her\r\n      eyes. Then he added:\n“No, you can’t understand what I learned from that illiterate man—that\r\n      simple fellow.”\n“Yes, yes, go on!” said Natásha. “Where is he?”\n“They killed him almost before my eyes.”\nAnd Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last\r\n      days of their retreat, of Karatáev’s illness and his death.\nHe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as it\r\n      were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was\r\n      telling it all to Natásha he experienced that pleasure which a man has\r\n      when women listen to him—not clever women who when listening either\r\n      try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity\r\n      offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own\r\n      and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little\r\n      mental workshop—but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a\r\n      capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself.\r\n      Natásha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word, no\r\n      single quiver in Pierre’s voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in his\r\n      face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its flight\r\n      and took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret meaning of\r\n      all Pierre’s mental travail.\nPrincess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she now\r\n      saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the\r\n      possibility of love and happiness between Natásha and Pierre, and the\r\n      first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.\nIt was three o’clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and\r\n      stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.\nPierre finished his story. Natásha continued to look at him intently with\r\n      bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand something\r\n      more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced and happy\r\n      confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what to say next\r\n      to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It occurred to\r\n      none of them that it was three o’clock and time to go to bed.\n“People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,” remarked Pierre, “but if at\r\n      this moment I were asked: ‘Would you rather be what you were before you\r\n      were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?’ then for heaven’s sake\r\n      let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine that when we are\r\n      thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is only then that what is\r\n      new and good begins. While there is life there is happiness. There is\r\n      much, much before us. I say this to you,” he added, turning to Natásha.\n“Yes, yes,” she said, answering something quite different. “I too should\r\n      wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.”\nPierre looked intently at her.\n“Yes, and nothing more,” said Natásha.\n“It’s not true, not true!” cried Pierre. “I am not to blame for being\r\n      alive and wishing to live—nor you either.”\nSuddenly Natásha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and began\r\n      to cry.\n“What is it, Natásha?” said Princess Mary.\n“Nothing, nothing.” She smiled at Pierre through her tears. “Good night!\r\n      It is time for bed.”\nPierre rose and took his leave.\n\nPrincess Mary and Natásha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of what\r\n      Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of Pierre\r\n      nor did Natásha speak of him.\n“Well, good night, Mary!” said Natásha. “Do you know, I am often afraid\r\n      that by not speaking of him” (she meant Prince Andrew) “for fear of not\r\n      doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.”\nPrincess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of\r\n      Natásha’s remark, but she did not express agreement in words.\n“Is it possible to forget?” said she.\n“It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and\r\n      painful, but good, very good!” said Natásha. “I am sure he really loved\r\n      him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?” she added, suddenly\r\n      blushing.\n“To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!” said Princess Mary.\n“Do you know, Mary...” Natásha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such\r\n      as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, “he has somehow\r\n      grown so clean, smooth, and fresh—as if he had just come out of a\r\n      Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn’t it true?”\n“Yes,” replied Princess Mary. “He has greatly improved.”\n“With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he\r\n      had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...”\n“I understand whyhe” (Prince Andrew) “liked no one so\r\n      much as him,” said Princess Mary.\n“Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they\r\n      are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike him—in\r\n      everything.”\n“Yes, but he’s wonderful.”\n“Well, good night,” said Natásha.\nAnd the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if\r\n      it had been forgotten there."

    "text": "It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced up\r\n      and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and\r\n      frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now\r\n      smiling happily.\nHe was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natásha, and of their love, at one\r\n      moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling. It\r\n      was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room.\n“Well, what’s to be done if it cannot be avoided? What’s to be done?\r\n      Evidently it has to be so,” said he to himself, and hastily undressing he\r\n      got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision.\n“Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything that\r\n      she and I may be man and wife,” he told himself.\nA few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the\r\n      Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savélich came to ask him about\r\n      packing for the journey.\n“What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?” he\r\n      asked involuntarily, though only to himself. “Oh, yes, long ago before\r\n      this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,” he\r\n      reflected. “Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and how\r\n      attentive, and how he remembers everything,” he thought, looking at\r\n      Savélich’s old face, “and what a pleasant smile he has!”\n“Well, Savélich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?” Pierre\r\n      asked him.\n“What’s the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the\r\n      late count—the kingdom of heaven be his!—and we have lived\r\n      under you too, without ever being wronged.”\n“And your children?”\n“The children will live just the same. With such masters one can live.”\n“But what about my heirs?” said Pierre. “Supposing I suddenly marry... it\r\n      might happen,” he added with an involuntary smile.\n“If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.”\n“How easy he thinks it,” thought Pierre. “He doesn’t know how terrible it\r\n      is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!”\n“So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?” asked Savélich.\n“No, I’ll put it off for a bit. I’ll tell you later. You must forgive the\r\n      trouble I have put you to,” said Pierre, and seeing Savélich smile, he\r\n      thought: “But how strange it is that he should not know that now there is\r\n      no Petersburg for me, and thatthatmust be settled first of all! But\r\n      probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall I have a\r\n      talk with him and see what he thinks?” Pierre reflected. “No, another\r\n      time.”\nAt breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to see\r\n      Princess Mary the day before and had there met—“Whom do you think?\r\n      Natásha Rostóva!”\nThe princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he\r\n      had seen Anna Semënovna.\n“Do you know her?” asked Pierre.\n“I have seen the princess,” she replied. “I heard that they were arranging\r\n      a match for her with young Rostóv. It would be a very good thing for the\r\n      Rostóvs, they are said to be utterly ruined.”\n“No; I mean do you know Natásha Rostóva?”\n“I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.”\n“No, she either doesn’t understand or is pretending,” thought Pierre.\r\n      “Better not say anything to her either.”\nThe princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre’s journey.\n“How kind they all are,” thought Pierre. “What is surprising is that they\r\n      should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest\r\n      to them. And all for me!”\nOn the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send a\r\n      representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be\r\n      returned to their owners that day.\n“And this man too,” thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief of\r\n      Police. “What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy bothering\r\n      about such triflesnow!And they actually say he is not honest and takes\r\n      bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn’t he take bribes? That’s the\r\n      way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a kind, pleasant\r\n      face and how he smiles as he looks at me.”\nPierre went to Princess Mary’s to dinner.\nAs he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down,\r\n      he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness of the\r\n      chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters of the\r\n      town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of the Rhine\r\n      and the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers, the carpenters\r\n      cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women hawkers, and the\r\n      shopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to\r\n      say: “Ah, there he is! Let’s see what will come of it!”\nAt the entrance to Princess Mary’s house Pierre felt doubtful whether he\r\n      had really been there the night before and really seen Natásha and talked\r\n      to her. “Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find no one\r\n      there.” But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence\r\n      with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom. She was in the\r\n      same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the\r\n      day before, yet she was quite different. Had she been like this when he\r\n      entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize\r\n      her.\nShe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince\r\n      Andrew’s fiancée. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on her\r\n      face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.\nPierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but\r\n      Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.\nNext day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though\r\n      Princess Mary and Natásha were evidently glad to see their visitor and\r\n      though all Pierre’s interest was now centered in that house, by the\r\n      evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from\r\n      one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long\r\n      that Princess Mary and Natásha exchanged glances, evidently wondering when\r\n      he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy and\r\n      embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his\r\n      leave.\nPrincess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of a\r\n      headache began to say good night.\n“So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?” she asked.\n“No, I am not going,” Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as\r\n      though offended. “Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow—but I won’t\r\n      say good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for\r\n      me,” said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not\r\n      taking his departure.\nNatásha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand\r\n      instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and\r\n      intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she had plainly\r\n      shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and long-drawn sigh she\r\n      seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.\nWhen Natásha left the room Pierre’s confusion and awkwardness immediately\r\n      vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly moved an\r\n      armchair toward Princess Mary.\n“Yes, I wanted to tell you,” said he, answering her look as if she had\r\n      spoken. “Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my dear\r\n      friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I know it’s\r\n      impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to her. No, not\r\n      that, I don’t, I can’t...”\nHe paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.\n“Well,” he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence.\r\n      “I don’t know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her alone\r\n      all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without her. I\r\n      cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that perhaps she might\r\n      someday be my wife and that I may be missing that possibility... that\r\n      possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do,\r\n      dear princess!” he added after a pause, and touched her hand as she did\r\n      not reply.\n“I am thinking of what you have told me,” answered Princess Mary. “This is\r\n      what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at present...”\nPrincess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was\r\n      impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in\r\n      Natásha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre\r\n      spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.\n“To speak to her now wouldn’t do,” said the princess all the same.\n“But what am I to do?”\n“Leave it to me,” said Princess Mary. “I know...”\nPierre was looking into Princess Mary’s eyes.\n“Well?... Well?...” he said.\n“I know that she loves... will love you,” Princess Mary corrected herself.\nBefore her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened\r\n      expression seized Princess Mary’s hand.\n“What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?”\n“Yes, I think so,” said Princess Mary with a smile. “Write to her parents,\r\n      and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to happen and my\r\n      heart tells me it will.”\n“No, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can’t be.... How happy I am! No,\r\n      it can’t be!” Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary’s hands.\n“Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,” she said.\n“To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I’ll go. But I may come again\r\n      tomorrow?”\nNext day Pierre came to say good-by. Natásha was less animated than she\r\n      had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre sometimes\r\n      felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any\r\n      longer, that nothing existed but happiness. “Is it possible? No, it can’t\r\n      be,” he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that filled his soul\r\n      with joy.\nWhen on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help\r\n      holding it a little longer in his own.\n“Is it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure\r\n      of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one\r\n      day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, that’s\r\n      impossible!...”\n“Good-by, Count,” she said aloud. “I shall look forward very much to your\r\n      return,” she added in a whisper.\nAnd these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which\r\n      accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible\r\n      memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre. “‘I shall\r\n      look forward very much to your return....’ Yes, yes, how did she say it?\r\n      Yes, ‘I shall look forward very much to your return.’ Oh, how happy I am!\r\n      What is happening to me? How happy I am!” said Pierre to himself."

    "text": "There was nothing in Pierre’s soul now at all like what had troubled it\r\n      during his courtship of Hélène.\nHe did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words\r\n      he had spoken, or say: “Oh, why did I not say that?” and,\r\n      “Whatever made me say‘Je vous aime’?” On the\r\n      contrary, he now repeated in imagination every word that he or Natásha had spoken\r\n      and pictured every detail of her face and smile, and did not wish to diminish or\r\n      add anything, but only to repeat it again and again. There was now not a shadow of\r\n      doubt in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong. Only\r\n      one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: “Wasn’t it all a dream?\r\n      Isn’t Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and self-confident? I\r\n      believe all this—and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and she will be\r\n      sure to smile and say: ‘How strange! He must be deluding himself.\r\n      Doesn’t he know that he is a man, just a man, while I...? I am something\r\n      altogether different and higher.’”\nThat was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any\r\n      plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he\r\n      could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended with\r\n      that.\nA joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable,\r\n      possessed him. The whole meaning of life—not for him alone but for\r\n      the whole world—seemed to him centered in his love and the\r\n      possibility of being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be\r\n      occupied with one thing only—his future happiness. Sometimes it\r\n      seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and\r\n      merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other\r\n      interests. In every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He\r\n      often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles\r\n      which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And\r\n      when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he\r\n      pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to\r\n      them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of\r\n      attention.\nWhen it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service, or\r\n      when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the\r\n      assumption that everybody’s welfare depended on this or that issue of\r\n      events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise people\r\n      by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everybody—both\r\n      those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that is,\r\n      what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not\r\n      understand it—in the bright light of the emotion that shone within\r\n      himself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything\r\n      that was good and worthy of being loved.\nWhen dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory\r\n      aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he now\r\n      knew. Prince Vasíli, who having obtained a new post and some fresh\r\n      decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed to him a pathetic,\r\n      kindly old man much to be pitied.\nOften in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity. All\r\n      the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true\r\n      for him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently, but when\r\n      he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the views he had\r\n      held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct.\n“I may have appeared strange and queer then,” he thought, “but I was not\r\n      so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had more insight\r\n      than at any other time, and understood all that is worth understanding in\r\n      life, because... because I was happy.”\nPierre’s insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to discover\r\n      personal attributes which he termed “good qualities” in people before\r\n      loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by loving people\r\n      without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them."

    "text": "After Pierre’s departure that first evening, when Natásha had said to\r\n      Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: “He looks just, yes, just as if\r\n      he had come out of a Russian bath—in a short coat and with his hair\r\n      cropped,” something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepressible,\r\n      awoke in Natásha’s soul.\nEverything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered. To her\r\n      own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and\r\n      demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to have forgotten all\r\n      that had happened to her. She no longer complained of her position, did\r\n      not say a word about the past, and no longer feared to make happy plans\r\n      for the future. She spoke little of Pierre, but when Princess Mary\r\n      mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and\r\n      her lips curved with a strange smile.\nThe change that took place in Natásha at first surprised Princess Mary;\r\n      but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. “Can she have loved\r\n      my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?” she thought\r\n      when she reflected on the change. But when she was with Natásha she was\r\n      not vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power\r\n      of life that had seized Natásha was so evidently irrepressible and\r\n      unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had\r\n      no right to reproach her even in her heart.\nNatásha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling\r\n      that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but\r\n      bright and cheerful.\nWhen Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with\r\n      Pierre, Natásha met her on the threshold.\n“He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?” she repeated.\nAnd a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for\r\n      her joy settled on Natásha’s face.\n“I wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.”\nUnderstandable and touching as the look with which Natásha gazed at her\r\n      seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation, these\r\n      words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his love.\n“But what’s to be done? She can’t help it,” thought the princess.\nAnd with a sad and rather stern look she told Natásha all that Pierre had\r\n      said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Natásha was astounded.\n“To Petersburg!” she repeated as if unable to understand.\nBut noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary’s face she guessed\r\n      the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.\n“Mary,” said she, “tell me what I should do! I am afraid of being bad.\r\n      Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me....”\n“You love him?”\n“Yes,” whispered Natásha.\n“Then why are you crying? I am happy for your sake,” said Princess Mary,\r\n      who because of those tears quite forgave Natásha’s joy.\n“It won’t be just yet—someday. Think what fun it will be when I am\r\n      his wife and you marry Nicholas!”\n“Natásha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about you.”\nThey were silent awhile.\n“But why go to Petersburg?” Natásha suddenly asked, and hastily replied to\r\n      her own question. “But no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He must....”"

    "text": "Seven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had\r\n      subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the\r\n      mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of their\r\n      motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.\nThough the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the movement\r\n      of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups of\r\n      people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of\r\n      kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation.\nThe sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as\r\n      previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not borne\r\n      by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed to\r\n      rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies, who\r\n      formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars, campaigns,\r\n      and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political and\r\n      diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.\nThe historians call this activity of the historical figures “the\r\n      reaction.”\nIn dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages\r\n      who, in their opinion, caused what they describe asthe reaction. All the\r\n      well-known people of that period, from Alexander and Napoleon to Madame de\r\n      Staël, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and the rest, pass\r\n      before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according\r\n      to whether they conduced toprogressor toreaction.\nAccording to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia\r\n      also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according to\r\n      them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of\r\n      his reign, being the savior of Russia.\nThere is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to\r\n      learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for\r\n      things he did wrong at this period of his reign.\n“He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he did\r\n      well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of his\r\n      reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution to Poland,\r\n      forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakchéev, favoring\r\n      Golítsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishkóv and Photius. He also acted\r\n      badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the\r\n      Semënov regiment.”\nIt would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians\r\n      address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity.\nWhat do these reproaches mean?\nDo not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I (the\r\n      liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with\r\n      Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813) flow\r\n      from the same sources—the circumstances of his birth, education, and\r\n      life—that made his personality what it was and from which the\r\n      actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of\r\n      Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed?\nIn what does the substance of those reproaches lie?\nIt lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I, standing\r\n      on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of\r\n      history focused upon him; a character exposed to those strongest of all\r\n      influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception inseparable from\r\n      power; a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility\r\n      for all that was happening in Europe; and not a fictitious but a live\r\n      character who like every man had his personal habits, passions, and\r\n      impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth—that this character—though\r\n      not lacking in virtue (the historians do not accuse him of that)—had\r\n      not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a\r\n      present-day professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with\r\n      learning: that is, with books and lectures and with taking notes from\r\n      them.\nBut even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in his\r\n      view of what was good for the people, we must inevitably assume that the\r\n      historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some time turn\r\n      out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity. This\r\n      assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because, watching the\r\n      movement of history, we see that every year and with each new writer,\r\n      opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what once seemed\r\n      good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is more, we find\r\n      at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and\r\n      what is good in history: some people regard giving a constitution to\r\n      Poland and forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in Alexander, while\r\n      others regard it as blameworthy.\nThe activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or\r\n      harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful. If\r\n      that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does not agree\r\n      with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the preservation\r\n      of my father’s house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian arms, or the\r\n      prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the freedom of\r\n      Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in Europe, or a\r\n      certain kind of European culture called “progress” appear to me to be good\r\n      or bad, I must admit that besides these things the action of every\r\n      historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me.\nBut let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all\r\n      contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by\r\n      which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander\r\n      could have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance from\r\n      those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the\r\n      movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to the\r\n      program his present accusers would have given him—of nationality,\r\n      freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Let us\r\n      assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated, and\r\n      that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of the\r\n      activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the\r\n      government—an activity that in the opinion of the historians was\r\n      good and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would\r\n      have been no life, there would have been nothing.\nIf we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of\r\n      life is destroyed."

    "text": "If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the\r\n      attainment of certain ends—the greatness of Russia or of France, the\r\n      balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of the Revolution,\r\n      general progress, or anything else—then it is impossible to explain\r\n      the facts of history without introducing the conceptions ofchanceandgenius.\nIf the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\n      had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might have been\r\n      accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion. If\r\n      the aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have been attained\r\n      without the Revolution and without the Empire. If the aim was the\r\n      dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have accomplished that\r\n      much better than warfare. If the aim was the progress of civilization, it\r\n      is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more\r\n      expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.\nWhy did it happen in this and not in some other way?\nBecause it happened so! “Chancecreated the situation;geniusutilized it,” says history.\nBut what ischance?What isgenius?\nThe wordschanceandgeniusdo not denote any really existing thing and\r\n      therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of\r\n      understanding of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I\r\n      think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk aboutchance. I see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human\r\n      agencies; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk ofgenius.\nTo a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special\r\n      enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to\r\n      be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with\r\n      a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram, who instead of\r\n      getting into the general fold every evening goes into a special enclosure\r\n      where there are oats—that this very ram, swelling with fat, is\r\n      killed for meat.\nBut the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them\r\n      happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only\r\n      admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken,\r\n      and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to\r\n      the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not know for what purpose they\r\n      are fattened, they will at least know that all that happened to the ram\r\n      did not happen accidentally, and will no longer need the conceptions ofchanceorgenius.\nOnly by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible\r\n      to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken, may we\r\n      discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters\r\n      and perceive the cause of the effect they produce (incommensurable with\r\n      ordinary human capabilities), and then the wordschanceandgeniusbecome superfluous.\nWe need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European\r\n      convulsions and that we know only the facts—that is, the murders,\r\n      first in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in\r\n      Spain, and in Russia—and that the movements from the west to the\r\n      east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these\r\n      events, and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and\r\n      genius in Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them\r\n      to be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have\r\n      recourse tochancefor an explanation of those small events which made\r\n      these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small\r\n      events were inevitable.\nBy discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall\r\n      clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for any\r\n      single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is\r\n      impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the\r\n      smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than Napoleon and\r\n      Alexander with all their antecedents."

    "text": "The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the\r\n      beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of\r\n      the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west.\r\n      The commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east. For\r\n      the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to\r\n      Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into a\r\n      military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike\r\n      military group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established\r\n      traditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movement they\r\n      should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them\r\n      the deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to be committed\r\n      during that movement.\nAnd beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately large group\r\n      was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, and step by step\r\n      a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and traditions,\r\n      and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the coming movement\r\n      and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done.\nA man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without a\r\n      name, and not even a Frenchman, emerges—by what seem the strangest\r\n      chances—from among all the seething French parties, and without\r\n      joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position.\nThe ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of his\r\n      opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and\r\n      self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army.\r\n      The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy, his\r\n      opponents’ reluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and\r\n      self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable so-calledchancesaccompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he falls with the rulers\r\n      of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to avoid his predestined\r\n      path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian service, and\r\n      the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During the war in\r\n      Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is\r\n      saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic considerations\r\n      the Russian armies—just those which might have destroyed his\r\n      prestige—do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.\nOn his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process of\r\n      dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and\r\n      destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous position presents\r\n      itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to Africa. Again\r\n      so-calledchanceaccompanies him. Impregnable Malta surrenders without a\r\n      shot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with success. The enemy’s\r\n      fleet, which subsequently did not let a single boat pass, allows his\r\n      entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole series of outrages are\r\n      committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. And the men who commit\r\n      these crimes, especially their leader, assure themselves that this is\r\n      admirable, this is glory—it resembles Caesar and Alexander the Great\r\n      and is therefore good.\nThis ideal ofgloryandgrandeur—which consists not merely in\r\n      considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every\r\n      crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural\r\n      significance—that ideal, destined to guide this man and his\r\n      associates, had scope for its development in Africa. Whatever he does\r\n      succeeds. The plague does not touch him. The cruelty of murdering\r\n      prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault. His childishly rash,\r\n      uncalled-for, and ignoble departure from Africa, leaving his comrades in\r\n      distress, is set down to his credit, and again the enemy’s fleet twice\r\n      lets him slip past. When, intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so\r\n      successfully, he reaches Paris, the dissolution of the republican\r\n      government, which a year earlier might have ruined him, has reached its\r\n      extreme limit, and his presence there now as a newcomer free from party\r\n      entanglements can only serve to exalt him—and though he himself has\r\n      no plan, he is quite ready for his new rôle.\nHe had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at\r\n      him and demanded his participation.\nHe alone—with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and\r\n      Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and frankness in\r\n      lying—he alone could justify what had to be done.\nHe is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from his\r\n      will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his mistakes,\r\n      he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the\r\n      conspiracy is crowned with success.\nHe is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes to\r\n      flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon and says\r\n      senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once proud and\r\n      shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are even\r\n      more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have said to\r\n      destroy him and retain their power.\nChance, millions ofchances, give him power, and all men as if by\r\n      agreement co-operate to confirm that power.Chanceforms the characters of\r\n      the rulers of France, who submit to him;chanceforms the character of\r\n      Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government;chancecontrives a plot\r\n      against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power.Chanceputs the Duc d’Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to\r\n      kill him—thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other\r\n      way that he had the right, since he had the might.Chancecontrives that\r\n      though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against England\r\n      (which would inevitably have ruined him) he never carries out that\r\n      intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and the Austrians, who\r\n      surrender without a battle.Chanceandgeniusgive him the victory at\r\n      Austerlitz; and bychanceall men, not only the French but all Europe—except\r\n      England which does not take part in the events about to happen—despite\r\n      their former horror and detestation of his crimes, now recognize his\r\n      authority, the title he has given himself, and his ideal of grandeur and\r\n      glory, which seems excellent and reasonable to them all.\nAs if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the\r\n      western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807, and\r\n      1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of people that had\r\n      formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central Europe.\r\n      The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the\r\n      movement grows with the increased size of the group. During the ten-year\r\n      preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned\r\n      heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the world can oppose no\r\n      reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal ofgloryandgrandeur.\r\n      One after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him.\r\n      The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek the great man’s mercy; the\r\n      Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter\r\n      of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the guardian of all that the\r\n      nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great\r\n      man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his\r\n      role, so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself\r\n      the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen. There is\r\n      no step, no crime or petty fraud he commits, which in the mouths of those\r\n      around him is not at once represented as a great deed. The most suitable\r\n      fête the Germans can devise for him is a celebration of Jena and\r\n      Auerstädt. Not only is he great, but so are his ancestors, his brothers,\r\n      his stepsons, and his brothers-in-law. Everything is done to deprive him\r\n      of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part. And\r\n      when he is ready so too are the forces.\nThe invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal—Moscow. That\r\n      city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing\r\n      armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram. But\r\n      suddenly instead of thosechancesand thatgeniuswhich hitherto had so\r\n      consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the\r\n      predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inversechancesoccur—from\r\n      the cold in his head at Borodinó to the sparks which set Moscow on fire,\r\n      and the frosts—and instead ofgenius, stupidity and immeasurable\r\n      baseness become evident.\nThe invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now not\r\n      for Napoleon but always against him.\nA countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable\r\n      resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east. Attempted drives\r\n      from east to west—similar to the contrary movements of 1805, 1807,\r\n      and 1809—precede the great westward movement; there is the same\r\n      coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion of the\r\n      people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation midway, and\r\n      the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.\nParis, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army\r\n      are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his\r\n      actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicablechanceoccurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their\r\n      sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his craft\r\n      exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years\r\n      previously and one year later—an outlawed brigand. But by some\r\n      strange chance no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man\r\n      who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand\r\n      is sent to an island two days’ sail from France, which for some reason is\r\n      presented to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and millions\r\n      of money are paid him."

    "text": "The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The waves\r\n      of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are formed in\r\n      which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have caused the floods\r\n      to abate.\nBut the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists\r\n      think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of\r\n      natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the position\r\n      seems to them insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising does not come\r\n      from the quarter they expect. It rises again from the same point as before—Paris.\r\n      The last backwash of the movement from the west occurs: a backwash which\r\n      serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and\r\n      ends the military movement of that period of history.\nThe man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any\r\n      conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by\r\n      strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they\r\n      cursed the day before and will curse again a month later.\nThis man is still needed to justify the final collective act.\nThat act is performed.\nThe last rôle is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his\r\n      powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.\nAnd some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in\r\n      solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when\r\n      the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole world\r\n      what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen\r\n      hand directed his actions.\nThe manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor\r\n      shows him to us.\n“See what you believed in! This is he! Do you now see that it was not he\r\n      but I who moved you?”\nBut dazed by the force of the movement, it was long before people\r\n      understood this.\nStill greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of Alexander\r\n      I, the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from east to west.\nWhat was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head of\r\n      that movement from east to west?\nWhat was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with European\r\n      affairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; a moral\r\n      superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him; a\r\n      mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance against\r\n      Napoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been\r\n      prepared by innumerable so-calledchancesin his life: his education, his\r\n      early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by Austerlitz, and\r\n      Tilsit, and Erfurt.\nDuring the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. But as\r\n      soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he\r\n      appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of\r\n      Europe, led them to the goal.\nThe goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all\r\n      possible power. How does he use it?\nAlexander I—the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early years\r\n      had striven only for his people’s welfare, the originator of the liberal\r\n      innovations in his fatherland—now that he seemed to possess the\r\n      utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the\r\n      welfare of his peoples—at the time when Napoleon in exile was\r\n      drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind\r\n      happy had he retained power—Alexander I, having fulfilled his\r\n      mission and feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the\r\n      insignificance of that supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it\r\n      into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:\n“Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too am a man like the\r\n      rest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God.”\nAs the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and yet\r\n      at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to comprehend,\r\n      so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet has them to\r\n      serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.\nA bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid of\r\n      bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the bee\r\n      sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the\r\n      fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from\r\n      flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey.\r\n      Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says\r\n      that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen,\r\n      and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices that the bee\r\n      flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter,\r\n      and sees in this the purpose of the bee’s existence. Another, observing\r\n      the migration of plants, notices that the bee helps in this work, and may\r\n      say that in this lies the purpose of the bee. But the ultimate purpose of\r\n      the bee is not exhausted by the first, the second, or any of the processes\r\n      the human mind can discern. The higher the human intellect rises in the\r\n      discovery of these purposes, the more obvious it becomes, that the\r\n      ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension.\nAll that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to\r\n      other manifestations of life. And so it is with the purpose of historic\r\n      characters and nations."

    "text": "Natásha’s wedding to Bezúkhov, which took place in 1813, was the last\r\n      happy event in the family of the old Rostóvs. Count Ilyá Rostóv died that\r\n      same year and, as always happens, after the father’s death the family\r\n      group broke up.\nThe events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the flight from\r\n      it, the death of Prince Andrew, Natásha’s despair, Pétya’s death, and the\r\n      old countess’ grief fell blow after blow on the old count’s head. He\r\n      seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events, and\r\n      bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting\r\n      further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightened and\r\n      distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.\nThe arrangements for Natásha’s marriage occupied him for a while. He\r\n      ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but\r\n      his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it\r\n      evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.\nWhen Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to\r\n      complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his bed.\r\n      He realized from the first that he would not get up again, despite the\r\n      doctor’s encouragement. The countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by\r\n      his pillow without undressing. Every time she gave him his medicine he\r\n      sobbed and silently kissed her hand. On his last day, sobbing, he asked\r\n      her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property—that\r\n      being the chief fault of which he was conscious. After receiving communion\r\n      and unction he quietly died; and next day a throng of acquaintances who\r\n      came to pay their last respects to the deceased filled the house rented by\r\n      the Rostóvs. All these acquaintances, who had so often dined and danced at\r\n      his house and had so often laughed at him, now said, with a common feeling\r\n      of self-reproach and emotion, as if justifying themselves: “Well, whatever\r\n      he may have been he was a most worthy man. You don’t meet such men\r\n      nowadays.... And which of us has not weaknesses of his own?”\nIt was just when the count’s affairs had become so involved that it was\r\n      impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he\r\n      unexpectedly died.\nNicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his father’s\r\n      death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and without waiting\r\n      for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to Moscow. The state\r\n      of the count’s affairs became quite obvious a month after his death,\r\n      surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of\r\n      which no one had suspected. The debts amounted to double the value of the\r\n      property.\nFriends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But he\r\n      regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father’s memory, which he held\r\n      sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the\r\n      inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.\nThe creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague but\r\n      powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count’s careless\r\n      good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once. As always\r\n      happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first,\r\n      and those who like Mítenka held promissory notes given them as presents\r\n      now became the most exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was allowed no\r\n      respite and no peace, and those who had seemed to pity the old man—the\r\n      cause of their losses (if they were losses)—now remorselessly\r\n      pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was\r\n      obviously not guilty of contracting them.\nNot one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold by\r\n      auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained unpaid.\r\n      Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brother-in-law\r\n      Bezúkhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value received.\r\n      And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as the creditors\r\n      threatened, he re-entered the government service.\nHe could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at the\r\n      next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on life; and\r\n      so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who had known\r\n      him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service, he accepted a\r\n      post in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of which he was so\r\n      fond, and moved with his mother and Sónya to a small house on the Sívtsev\r\n      Vrazhók.\nNatásha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no clear\r\n      idea of Nicholas’ circumstances. Having borrowed money from his\r\n      brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him.\r\n      His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve\r\n      hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and Sónya, but\r\n      had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. The countess\r\n      could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been\r\n      used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was for her son,\r\n      kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to send for a\r\n      friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, or wine for her\r\n      son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for Natásha or Sónya, or for\r\n      Nicholas himself.\nSónya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her whims\r\n      and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty from the\r\n      old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to Sónya for all\r\n      she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and\r\n      devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.\nHe seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and because\r\n      there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that people are valued\r\n      for, but little that could have made him love her. He felt that the more\r\n      he valued her the less he loved her. He had taken her at her word when she\r\n      wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed\r\n      between them had been long forgotten and could never in any case be\r\n      renewed.\nNicholas’ position became worse and worse. The idea of putting something\r\n      aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he not save anything,\r\n      but to comply with his mother’s demands he even incurred some small debts.\r\n      He could see no way out of this situation. The idea of marrying some rich\r\n      woman, which was suggested to him by his female relations, was repugnant\r\n      to him. The other way out—his mother’s death—never entered his\r\n      head. He wished for nothing and hoped for nothing, and deep in his heart\r\n      experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance\r\n      of his position. He tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their\r\n      commiseration and offensive offers of assistance; he avoided all\r\n      distraction and recreation, and even at home did nothing but play cards\r\n      with his mother, pace silently up and down the room, and smoke one pipe\r\n      after another. He seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy\r\n      mood which alone enabled him to endure his position."

    "text": "At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports\r\n      current in town she learned how the Rostóvs were situated, and how “the\r\n      son has sacrificed himself for his mother,” as people were saying.\n“I never expected anything else of him,” said Princess Mary to herself,\r\n      feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her friendly\r\n      relations with all the Rostóvs which had made her almost a member of the\r\n      family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But remembering her\r\n      relations with Nicholas in Vorónezh she was shy about doing so. Making a\r\n      great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her\r\n      arrival in Moscow.\nNicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess’ room could only be\r\n      reached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had\r\n      expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff, proud\r\n      expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her health,\r\n      led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes left the\r\n      room.\nWhen the princess came out of the countess’ room Nicholas met her again,\r\n      and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom.\r\n      To her remarks about his mother’s health he made no reply. “What’s that to\r\n      you? Leave me in peace,” his looks seemed to say.\n“Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can’t bear these\r\n      ladies and all these civilities!” said he aloud in Sónya’s presence,\r\n      evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princess’ carriage had\r\n      disappeared.\n“Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?” cried Sónya, hardly able to\r\n      conceal her delight. “She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!”\nNicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any\r\n      more. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a\r\n      day.\nShe sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, expressed a\r\n      wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored when she began to\r\n      talk about her.\nNicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess, but\r\n      his silence irritated her.\n“She is a very admirable and excellent young woman,” said she, “and you\r\n      must go and call on her. You would at least be seeing somebody, and I\r\n      think it must be dull for you only seeing us.”\n“But I don’t in the least want to, Mamma.”\n“You used to want to, and now you don’t. Really I don’t understand you, my\r\n      dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see anyone.”\n“But I never said I was dull.”\n“Why, you said yourself you don’t want even to see her. She is a very\r\n      admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you have\r\n      got some notion or other in your head. You hide everything from me.”\n“Not at all, Mamma.”\n“If I were asking you to do something disagreeable now—but I only\r\n      ask you to return a call. One would think mere politeness required it....\r\n      Well, I have asked you, and now I won’t interfere any more since you have\r\n      secrets from your mother.”\n“Well, then, I’ll go if you wish it.”\n“It doesn’t matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.”\nNicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a patience,\r\n      trying to divert his mother’s attention to another topic.\nThe same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the day\r\n      after that.\nAfter her visit to the Rostóvs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by\r\n      Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been right in\r\n      not wishing to be the first to call.\n“I expected nothing else,” she told herself, calling her pride to her aid.\r\n      “I have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the old lady, who\r\n      was always kind to me and to whom I am under many obligations.”\nBut she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin to\r\n      remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she had firmly\r\n      resolved not to call on the Rostóvs again and to forget the whole matter,\r\n      she felt herself all the time in an awkward position. And when she asked\r\n      herself what distressed her, she had to admit that it was her relation to\r\n      Rostóv. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling for her (she\r\n      knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could discover what\r\n      that something was, she felt that she could not be at ease.\nOne day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her\r\n      nephew’s lessons, she was informed that Rostóv had called. With a firm\r\n      resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent for\r\n      Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.\nHer first glance at Nicholas’ face told her that he had only come to\r\n      fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain the\r\n      tone in which he addressed her.\nThey spoke of the countess’ health, of their mutual friends, of the latest\r\n      war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after\r\n      which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.\nWith Mademoiselle Bourienne’s help the princess had maintained the\r\n      conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose,\r\n      she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her mind was\r\n      so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in\r\n      life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her luminous eyes\r\n      gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had risen.\nNicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her\r\n      abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then again\r\n      looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of suffering\r\n      on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely\r\n      conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed. He\r\n      wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could think of nothing\r\n      to say.\n“Good-by, Princess!” said he.\nShe started, flushed, and sighed deeply.\n“Oh, I beg your pardon,” she said as if waking up. “Are you going already,\r\n      Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the countess!”\n“Wait a moment, I’ll fetch it,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she left\r\n      the room.\nThey both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.\n“Yes, Princess,” said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, “it doesn’t seem\r\n      long ago since we first met at Boguchárovo, but how much water has flowed\r\n      since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet I would give\r\n      much to bring back that time... but there’s no bringing it back.”\nPrincess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as\r\n      he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his\r\n      words which would explain his feeling for her.\n“Yes, yes,” said she, “but you have no reason to regret the past, Count.\r\n      As I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it with\r\n      satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now...”\n“I cannot accept your praise,” he interrupted her hurriedly. “On the\r\n      contrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an\r\n      interesting or cheerful subject.”\nHis face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the\r\n      princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it\r\n      was to him that she now spoke.\n“I thought you would allow me to tell you this,” she said. “I had come so\r\n      near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not\r\n      consider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,” and suddenly her\r\n      voice trembled. “I don’t know why,” she continued, recovering herself,\r\n      “but you used to be different, and...”\n“There are a thousand reasonswhy,” laying special emphasis on thewhy.\r\n      “Thank you, Princess,” he added softly. “Sometimes it is hard.”\n“So that’s why! That’s why!” a voice whispered in Princess Mary’s soul.\r\n      “No, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that\r\n      handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble, resolute,\r\n      self-sacrificing spirit too,” she said to herself. “Yes, he is poor now\r\n      and I am rich.... Yes, that’s the only reason.... Yes, were it not for\r\n      that...” And remembering his former tenderness, and looking now at his\r\n      kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness.\n“But why, Count, why?” she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer to\r\n      him. “Why? Tell me. You must tell me!”\nHe was silent.\n“I don’t understand yourwhy, Count,” she continued,\r\n      “but it’s hard for me... I confess it. For some reason you wish to\r\n      deprive me of our former friendship. And that hurts me.” There were tears\r\n      in her eyes and in her voice. “I have had so little happiness in life that\r\n      every loss is hard for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!” and suddenly she\r\n      began to cry and was hurrying from the room.\n“Princess, for God’s sake!” he exclaimed, trying to stop her. “Princess!”\nShe turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one another’s\r\n      eyes—and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became\r\n      possible, inevitable, and very near."

    "text": "In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald\r\n      Hills with his wife, his mother, and Sónya.\nWithin four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling\r\n      any of his wife’s property, and having received a small inheritance on the\r\n      death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well.\nIn another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he was\r\n      able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating to buy\r\n      back Otrádnoe—that being his pet dream.\nHaving started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it that\r\n      it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was a\r\n      plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones\r\n      then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate\r\n      management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products, and the\r\n      buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any particular\r\n      part of the work on his estate. He always had before his mind’s eyethe\r\n      estateas a whole and not any particular part of it. The chief thing in\r\n      his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen in the air, nor\r\n      manures, nor special plows, but that most important agent by which\r\n      nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made effective—the peasant\r\n      laborer. When Nicholas first began farming and began to understand its\r\n      different branches, it was the serf who especially attracted his\r\n      attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely a tool, but also a judge\r\n      of farming and an end in himself. At first he watched the serfs, trying to\r\n      understand their aims and what they considered good and bad, and only\r\n      pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from\r\n      them their methods, their manner of speech, and their judgment of what was\r\n      good and bad. Only when he had understood the peasants’ tastes and\r\n      aspirations, had learned to talk their language, to grasp the hidden\r\n      meaning of their words, and felt akin to them did he begin boldly to\r\n      manage his serfs, that is, to perform toward them the duties demanded of\r\n      him. And Nicholas’ management produced very brilliant results.\nGuided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the estates\r\n      he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and delegate,\r\n      the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right\r\n      to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before analyzing the\r\n      properties of manure, before entering into thedebitandcredit(as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the peasants had and\r\n      increased the number by all possible means. He kept the peasant families\r\n      together in the largest groups possible, not allowing the family groups to\r\n      divide into separate households. He was hard alike on the lazy, the\r\n      depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled from the commune.\nHe was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants’ hay and corn\r\n      as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so\r\n      early and so well, or got so good a return, as did Nicholas.\nHe disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs—the\r\n      “drones” as he called them—and everyone said he spoiled them by his\r\n      laxity. When a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf,\r\n      especially if one had to be punished, he always felt undecided and\r\n      consulted everybody in the house; but when it was possible to have a\r\n      domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the\r\n      least hesitation. He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the\r\n      peasants. He knew that his every decision would be approved by them all\r\n      with very few exceptions.\nHe did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to make\r\n      things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined to do\r\n      so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or\r\n      should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own\r\n      mind.\nOften, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would\r\n      say: “What can one do with our Russian peasants?” and imagined that he\r\n      could not bear them.\nYet he loved “our Russian peasants” and their way of life with his whole\r\n      soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way\r\n      and manner of farming which produced good results.\nCountess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband’s and regretted\r\n      that she could not share it; but she could not understand the joys and\r\n      vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote and alien. She\r\n      could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when,\r\n      after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields\r\n      or on the threshing floor, he returned from the sowing or mowing or\r\n      reaping to have tea with her. She did not understand why he spoke with\r\n      such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well-to-do\r\n      peasant Matthew Ermíshin, who with his family had carted corn all night;\r\n      or of the fact that his (Nicholas’) sheaves were already stacked before\r\n      anyone else had his harvest in. She did not understand why he stepped out\r\n      from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so\r\n      joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty\r\n      shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind carried away a threatening\r\n      cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn, flushed,\r\n      sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his\r\n      hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would say: “Well, one more day and\r\n      my grain and the peasants’ will all be under cover.”\nStill less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to\r\n      anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought him\r\n      a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be\r\n      excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately refuse\r\n      her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business. She\r\n      felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and which had laws\r\n      she had not fathomed.\nSometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he\r\n      was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: “Not in the least;\r\n      it never entered my head and I wouldn’t dothatfor their good!\r\n      That’s all poetry and old wives’ talk—all that doing good to\r\n      one’s neighbor! What I want is that our children should not have to go\r\n      begging. I must put our affairs in order while I am alive, that’s all.\r\n      And to do that, order and strictness are essential.... That’s all about\r\n      it!” said he, clenching his vigorous fist. “And fairness, of\r\n      course,” he added, “for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has\r\n      only one miserable horse, he can do no good either for himself or for me.”\nAnd all Nicholas did was fruitful—probably just because he refused\r\n      to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue’s\r\n      sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came to\r\n      beg him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his\r\n      administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs. “He was a master...\r\n      the peasants’ affairs first and then his own. Of course he was not to be\r\n      trifled with either—in a word, he was a real master!”"

    "text": "One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas, and\r\n      that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making\r\n      free use of his fists. At first he saw nothing reprehensible in this, but\r\n      in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment\r\n      suddenly changed.\nOnce in summer he had sent for the village elder from Boguchárovo, a man\r\n      who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of\r\n      dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch to\r\n      question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the\r\n      sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas went\r\n      up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame,\r\n      and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning. Among\r\n      other things he spoke of the Boguchárovo elder. Countess Mary turned red\r\n      and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed\r\n      and gave her husband no reply.\n“Such an insolent scoundrel!” he cried, growing hot again at the mere\r\n      recollection of him. “If he had told me he was drunk and did not see...\r\n      But what is the matter with you, Mary?” he suddenly asked.\nCountess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked down\r\n      again and her lips puckered.\n“Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?”\nThe looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in\r\n      tears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow or\r\n      pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm.\nThe moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and\r\n      began to cry.\n“Nicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!” and\r\n      she covered her face with her hands.\nNicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up and\r\n      down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could not in\r\n      his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from childhood\r\n      as quite an everyday event was wrong. “Is it just sentimentality, old\r\n      wives’ tales, or is she right?” he asked himself. Before he had solved\r\n      that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain, and he\r\n      suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning\r\n      against himself.\n“Mary,” he said softly, going up to her, “it will never happen again; I\r\n      give you my word. Never,” he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy\r\n      asking for forgiveness.\nThe tears flowed faster still from the countess’ eyes. She took his hand\r\n      and kissed it.\n“Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?” she asked to change the\r\n      subject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of\r\n      Laocoön’s head.\n“Today—it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don’t remind me of it!” and\r\n      again he flushed. “I give you my word of honor it shan’t occur again, and\r\n      let this always be a reminder to me,” and he pointed to the broken ring.\nAfter that, when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the\r\n      blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would\r\n      turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man\r\n      who was making him angry. But he did forget himself once or twice within a\r\n      twelvemonth, and then he would go and confess to his wife, and would again\r\n      promise that this should really be the very last time.\n“Mary, you must despise me!” he would say. “I deserve it.”\n“You should go, go away at once, if you don’t feel strong enough to\r\n      control yourself,” she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.\nAmong the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked. He\r\n      did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and\r\n      consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The\r\n      whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work on\r\n      his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same\r\n      business-like seriousness—leaving home for a month, or even two,\r\n      with his hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time\r\n      reading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he spent\r\n      a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious\r\n      library, and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought. He\r\n      would sit in his study with a grave air, reading—a task he first\r\n      imposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwards became a habit\r\n      affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being\r\n      occupied with serious matters. In winter, except for business excursions,\r\n      he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and\r\n      entering into all the details of his children’s relations with their\r\n      mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he\r\n      daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her.\nFrom the time of his marriage Sónya had lived in his house. Before that,\r\n      Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and Sónya,\r\n      blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess Mary to be\r\n      gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrong he had\r\n      done Sónya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her wealth\r\n      had influenced Nicholas’ choice. She could not find fault with Sónya in\r\n      any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will toward her\r\n      which she could not overcome.\nOnce she had a talk with her friend Natásha about Sónya and about her own\r\n      injustice toward her.\n“You know,” said Natásha, “you have read the Gospels a great deal—there\r\n      is a passage in them that just fits Sónya.”\n“What?” asked Countess Mary, surprised.\n“‘To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be\r\n      taken away.’ You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I don’t know.\r\n      Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don’t know, but from her is taken away, and\r\n      everything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her.\r\n      Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had a sort\r\n      of presentiment that it would not come off. She is asterile flower, you\r\n      know—like some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for her,\r\n      and sometimes I think she doesn’t feel it as you or I would.”\nThough Countess Mary told Natásha that those words in the Gospel must be\r\n      understood differently, yet looking at Sónya she agreed with Natásha’s\r\n      explanation. It really seemed that Sónya did not feel her position trying,\r\n      and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as asterile flower. She seemed\r\n      to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a whole. Like a\r\n      cat, she had attached herself not to the people but to the home. She\r\n      waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children, was always\r\n      ready to render the small services for which she had a gift, and all this\r\n      was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude.\nThe country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the same\r\n      scale as under the old prince.\nThe buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than\r\n      simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,\r\n      plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with very\r\n      simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own serf\r\n      carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious and had\r\n      rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole families of\r\n      the Rostóvs’ and Bolkónskis’ relations sometimes came to Bald Hills with\r\n      sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months. Besides that,\r\n      four times a year, on the name days and birthdays of the hosts, as many as\r\n      a hundred visitors would gather there for a day or two. The rest of the\r\n      year life pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations, and\r\n      its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers, provided out of the produce\r\n      of the estate."

    "text": "It was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. Natásha had\r\n      been staying at her brother’s with her husband and children since early\r\n      autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three\r\n      weeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was\r\n      expected back every minute.\nBesides the Bezúkhov family, Nicholas’ old friend the retired General\r\n      Vasíli Dmítrich Denísov was staying with the Rostóvs this fifth of\r\n      December.\nOn the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of\r\n      visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for a\r\n      tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to the new\r\n      church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to\r\n      congratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections of\r\n      the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that\r\n      day in his usual way. He examined the bailiff’s accounts of the village in\r\n      Ryazán which belonged to his wife’s nephew, wrote two business letters,\r\n      and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and stables before dinner.\r\n      Having taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on\r\n      the morrow because it was a great saint’s day, he returned to dinner, and\r\n      without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at the long\r\n      table laid for twenty persons, at which the whole household had assembled.\r\n      At that table were his mother, his mother’s old lady companion Belóva, his\r\n      wife, their three children with their governess and tutor, his wife’s\r\n      nephew with his tutor, Sónya, Denísov, Natásha, her three children, their\r\n      governess, and old Michael Ivánovich, the late prince’s architect, who was\r\n      living on in retirement at Bald Hills.\nCountess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband took his\r\n      place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking up his\r\n      table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him,\r\n      that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when he came in to\r\n      dinner straight from the farm—especially before the soup. Countess\r\n      Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in a good frame\r\n      of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to talk to\r\n      him and make him admit that there was no cause for his ill-humor. But\r\n      today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should be angry with her\r\n      without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked him where he had been.\r\n      He replied. She again inquired whether everything was going well on the\r\n      farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied\r\n      hastily.\n“Then I’m not mistaken,” thought Countess Mary. “Why is he cross with me?”\r\n       She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished to end\r\n      the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but could not\r\n      refrain from asking some more questions.\nThanks to Denísov the conversation at table soon became general and\r\n      lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table and\r\n      went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her hand\r\n      and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.\n“You always have such strange fancies! I didn’t even think of being\r\n      angry,” he replied.\nBut the wordalwaysseemed to her to imply: “Yes, I am angry\r\n      but I won’t tell you why.”\nNicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sónya and the\r\n      old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree,\r\n      could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their moments\r\n      of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they had been\r\n      happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and\r\n      hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary’s\r\n      pregnancies, and this was such a time.\n“Well,messieurs et mesdames,” said Nicholas loudly and with apparent\r\n      cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to vex\r\n      her), “I have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I shall\r\n      have to suffer, so today I’ll go and rest.”\nAnd without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay\r\n      down on the sofa.\n“That’s always the way,” thought Countess Mary. “He talks to everyone\r\n      except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I am\r\n      in this condition.” She looked down at her expanded figure and in the\r\n      glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked\r\n      larger than ever.\nAnd everything annoyed her—Denísov’s shouting and laughter,\r\n      Natásha’s talk, and especially a quick glance Sónya gave her.\nSónya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling\r\n      irritated.\nHaving sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of what\r\n      they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.\nThe children were playing at “going to Moscow” in a carriage made of\r\n      chairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with them\r\n      a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness\r\n      worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with difficulty, went to\r\n      the small sitting room.\n“Perhaps he is not asleep; I’ll have an explanation with him,” she said to\r\n      herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother, followed her\r\n      on tiptoe. She did not notice him.\n“Mary, dear, I think he is asleep—he was so tired,” said Sónya,\r\n      meeting her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she\r\n      crossed her path everywhere). “Andrew may wake him.”\nCountess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that\r\n      Sónya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident\r\n      difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but\r\n      to avoid obeying Sónya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went\r\n      to the door. Sónya went away by another door. From the room in which\r\n      Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every\r\n      slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it\r\n      she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his\r\n      whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when\r\n      he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at that\r\n      moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: “Papa! Mamma’s\r\n      standing here!” Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs to\r\n      the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to\r\n      Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through\r\n      the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and\r\n      his voice said crossly:\n“I can’t get a moment’s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring him\r\n      here?”\n“I only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....”\nNicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the door\r\n      and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little black-eyed\r\n      three-year-old Natásha, her father’s pet, having learned from her brother\r\n      that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran to her father\r\n      unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the\r\n      creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy\r\n      little legs, and having examined the position of her father, who was\r\n      asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay\r\n      under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face.\n“Natásha, Natásha!” came Countess Mary’s frightened whisper from the door.\r\n      “Papa wants to sleep.”\n“No, Mamma, he doesn’t want to sleep,” said little Natásha with\r\n      conviction. “He’s laughing.”\nNicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.\n“Come in, Mary,” he said to his wife.\nShe went in and sat down by her husband.\n“I did not notice him following me,” she said timidly. “I just looked in.”\nHolding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife and,\r\n      seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and kissed her\r\n      hair.\n“May I kiss Mamma?” he asked Natásha.\nNatásha smiled bashfully.\n“Again!” she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot\r\n      where Nicholas had placed the kiss.\n“I don’t know why you think I am cross,” said Nicholas, replying to the\r\n      question he knew was in his wife’s mind.\n“You have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are like that.\r\n      It always seems to me...”\n“Mary, don’t talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” he said\r\n      gaily.\n“It seems to be that you can’t love me, that I am so plain... always...\r\n      and now... in this cond...”\n“Oh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it’s love that\r\n      makes us see beauty. It is only Malvínas and women of that kind who are\r\n      loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I don’t love her, but... I\r\n      don’t know how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between us\r\n      like this, I seem lost and can’t do anything. Now do I love my finger? I\r\n      don’t love it, but just try to cut it off!”\n“I’m not like that myself, but I understand. So you’re not angry with me?”\n“Awfully angry!” he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing his hair\r\n      he began to pace the room.\n“Do you know, Mary, what I’ve been thinking?” he began, immediately\r\n      thinking aloud in his wife’s presence now that they had made it up.\nHe did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A\r\n      thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he told\r\n      her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.\nCountess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in her\r\n      turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the children.\n“You can see the woman in her already,” she said in French, pointing to\r\n      little Natásha. “You reproach us women with being illogical. Here is our\r\n      logic. I say: ‘Papa wants to sleep!’ but she says, ‘No, he’s laughing.’\r\n      And she was right,” said Countess Mary with a happy smile.\n“Yes, yes.” And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong hand,\r\n      lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the legs, and\r\n      paced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree happiness on\r\n      the faces of both father and daughter.\n“But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,” his wife\r\n      whispered in French.\n“Yes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...”\nAt that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in\r\n      the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.\n“Somebody has come.”\n“I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,” said Countess Mary and left\r\n      the room.\nIn her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a\r\n      gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly\r\n      from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded him of\r\n      dancing, and looking at the child’s round happy little face he thought of\r\n      what she would be like when he was an old man, taking her into society and\r\n      dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had dancedDaniel Cooperwith his daughter.\n“It is he, it is he, Nicholas!” said Countess Mary, re-entering the room a\r\n      few minutes later. “Now our Natásha has come to life. You should have seen\r\n      her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long. Well,\r\n      come along now, quick, quick! It’s time you two were parted,” she added,\r\n      looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.\nNicholas went out holding the child by the hand.\nCountess Mary remained in the sitting room.\n“I should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,” she\r\n      whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time she\r\n      sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt,\r\n      through her happiness, that there is another sort of happiness\r\n      unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that\r\n      instant."

    "text": "Natásha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had\r\n      three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now\r\n      nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was difficult to\r\n      recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively Natásha of\r\n      former days. Her features were more defined and had a calm, soft, and\r\n      serene expression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing\r\n      animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm. Now\r\n      her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was not\r\n      visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and\r\n      fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That\r\n      happened only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home,\r\n      or a sick child was convalescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke of\r\n      Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband, who she imagined\r\n      was jealous of Prince Andrew’s memory), or on the rare occasions when\r\n      something happened to induce her to sing, a practice she had quite\r\n      abandoned since her marriage. At the rare moments when the old fire did\r\n      kindle in her handsome, fully developed body she was even more attractive\r\n      than in former days.\nSince their marriage Natásha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in\r\n      Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to\r\n      say, in Nicholas’ house. The young Countess Bezúkhova was not often seen\r\n      in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her and\r\n      found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that Natásha liked solitude—she\r\n      did not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought that she did\r\n      not—but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing of her\r\n      children, and sharing every moment of her husband’s life, she had demands\r\n      on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society. All who\r\n      had known Natásha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at\r\n      something extraordinary. Only the old countess with her maternal instinct\r\n      had realized that all Natásha’s outbursts had been due to her need of\r\n      children and a husband—as she herself had once exclaimed at Otrádnoe\r\n      not so much in fun as in earnest—and her mother was now surprised at\r\n      the surprise expressed by those who had never understood Natásha, and she\r\n      kept saying that she had always known that Natásha would make an exemplary\r\n      wife and mother.\n“Only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds,”\r\n       said the countess, “so that it even becomes absurd.”\nNatásha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,\r\n      especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself go\r\n      when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be even\r\n      more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and should\r\n      fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband.\r\n      Natásha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery, of which\r\n      her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up just\r\n      because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with her manners\r\n      or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show herself to her\r\n      husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him by\r\n      being too exacting. She acted in contradiction to all those rules. She\r\n      felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would\r\n      now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband, to whom she had from\r\n      the first moment given herself up entirely—that is, with her whole\r\n      soul, leaving no corner of it hidden from him. She felt that her unity\r\n      with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had\r\n      attracted him to her, but by something else—indefinite but firm as\r\n      the bond between her own body and soul.\nTo fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic\r\n      songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn\r\n      herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps have\r\n      been agreeable—she did not know—but she had no time at all for\r\n      it. The chief reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress, or\r\n      to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these\r\n      things.\nWe know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a\r\n      subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so trivial\r\n      that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one’s entire attention is\r\n      devoted to it.\nThe subject which wholly engrossed Natásha’s attention was her family:\r\n      that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong\r\n      entirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she had to bear,\r\n      bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.\nAnd the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole\r\n      soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger did\r\n      that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers\r\n      appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was\r\n      unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.\nThere were then as now conversations and discussions about women’s rights,\r\n      the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights, though\r\n      these themes were not yet termedquestionsas they are now; but these\r\n      topics were not merely uninteresting to Natásha, she positively did not\r\n      understand them.\nThese questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing in\r\n      marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that is,\r\n      only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance, which lies\r\n      in the family.\nDiscussions and questions of that kind, which are like the question of how\r\n      to get the greatest gratification from one’s dinner, did not then and do\r\n      not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the\r\n      nourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is the family.\nIf the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two\r\n      dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his\r\n      purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.\nIf the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have\r\n      many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that case\r\n      will not have a family.\nIf the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the\r\n      family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one\r\n      can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the\r\n      family—that is, one wife or one husband. Natásha needed a husband. A\r\n      husband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw no\r\n      need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul\r\n      were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine and\r\n      saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different.\nNatásha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the\r\n      society of her relatives—Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother,\r\n      and Sónya. She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding\r\n      disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with joyful face\r\n      show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby’s napkin, and from whom she\r\n      could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better.\nTo such an extent had Natásha let herself go that the way she dressed and\r\n      did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy—she was jealous\r\n      of Sónya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plain—were\r\n      habitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general opinion was that\r\n      Pierre was under his wife’s thumb, which was really true. From the very\r\n      first days of their married life Natásha had announced her demands. Pierre\r\n      was greatly surprised by his wife’s view, to him a perfectly novel one,\r\n      that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family. His\r\n      wife’s demands astonished him, but they also flattered him, and he\r\n      submitted to them.\nPierre’s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt\r\n      with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did not dare\r\n      dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a whim, and did\r\n      not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on business—in\r\n      which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which she did not in\r\n      the least understand but to which she attributed great importance. To make\r\n      up for this, at home Pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of\r\n      the whole family exactly as he chose. At home Natásha placed herself in\r\n      the position of a slave to her husband, and the whole household went on\r\n      tiptoe when he was occupied—that is, was reading or writing in his\r\n      study. Pierre had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what\r\n      he liked done always. He had only to express a wish and Natásha would jump\r\n      up and run to fulfill it.\nThe entire household was governed according to Pierre’s supposed orders,\r\n      that is, by his wishes which Natásha tried to guess. Their way of life and\r\n      place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Natásha’s occupations,\r\n      the children’s upbringing, were all selected not merely with regard to\r\n      Pierre’s expressed wishes, but to what Natásha from the thoughts he\r\n      expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she deduced the\r\n      essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once arrived at them\r\n      clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind\r\n      she would fight him with his own weapons.\nThus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their\r\n      first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse three\r\n      times and Natásha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her of\r\n      Rousseau’s view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet nurse is\r\n      unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite the opposition\r\n      of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband himself—who were\r\n      all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself, a thing then\r\n      unheard of and considered injurious—she insisted on having her own\r\n      way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.\nIt very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife\r\n      would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and\r\n      delight would find in his wife’s ideas and actions the very thought\r\n      against which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous that\r\n      in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion.\nAfter seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness\r\n      that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw himself\r\n      reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself\r\n      inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in him\r\n      was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected. And\r\n      this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and\r\n      mysterious reflection."

    "text": "Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rostóvs he\r\n      had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come to\r\n      Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed\r\n      there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal founders.\nOn reading that letter (she always read her husband’s letters) Natásha\r\n      herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel\r\n      his absence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all her\r\n      husband’s intellectual and abstract interests though she did not\r\n      understand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such\r\n      matters. To Pierre’s timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she\r\n      replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return. He\r\n      was given four weeks’ leave of absence.\nEver since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight\r\n      before, Natásha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and\r\n      irritability.\nDenísov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the\r\n      present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He looked at\r\n      Natásha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once\r\n      dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about the nursery\r\n      was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress.\nNatásha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her mother,\r\n      her brother, Sónya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her tried\r\n      to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning.\n“It’s all nonsense, all rubbish—those discussions which lead to\r\n      nothing and all those idiotic societies!” Natásha declared of the very\r\n      affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.\nAnd she would go to the nursery to nurse Pétya, her only boy. No one else\r\n      could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this little\r\n      three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she was conscious\r\n      of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little nose. That\r\n      creature said: “You are angry, you are jealous, you would like to pay him\r\n      out, you are afraid—but here am I! And I am he...” and that was\r\n      unanswerable. It was more than true.\nDuring that fortnight of anxiety Natásha resorted to the baby for comfort\r\n      so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him and he fell\r\n      ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was just what she\r\n      needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more\r\n      easily.\nShe was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre’s sleigh was heard at the\r\n      front door, and the old nurse—knowing how to please her mistress—entered\r\n      the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming face.\n“Has he come?” Natásha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest she\r\n      should rouse the dozing baby.\n“He’s come, ma’am,” whispered the nurse.\nThe blood rushed to Natásha’s face and her feet involuntarily moved, but\r\n      she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his eyes and\r\n      looked at her. “You’re here?” he seemed to be saying, and again lazily\r\n      smacked his lips.\nCautiously withdrawing her breast, Natásha rocked him a little, handed him\r\n      to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door. But at the door\r\n      she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left\r\n      the child too soon, and she glanced round. The nurse with raised elbows\r\n      was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot.\n“Go, ma’am! Don’t worry, go!” she whispered, smiling, with the kind of\r\n      familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.\nNatásha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.\nDenísov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his\r\n      pipe, now for the first time recognized the old Natásha. A flood of\r\n      brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.\n“He’s come!” she exclaimed as she ran past, and Denísov felt that he too\r\n      was delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had returned.\nOn reaching the vestibule Natásha saw a tall figure in a fur coat\r\n      unwinding his scarf. “It’s he! It’s really he! He has come!” she said to\r\n      herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head to her breast,\r\n      and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face, covered with\r\n      hoarfrost. “Yes, it is he, happy and contented....”\nThen all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had\r\n      experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her face\r\n      vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of reproaches\r\n      and angry words.\n“Yes, it’s all very well for you. You are pleased, you’ve had a good\r\n      time.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration\r\n      for the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... Pétya was at\r\n      death’s door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, enjoying...”\nPierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come sooner; he\r\n      knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two;\r\n      above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy. He wanted to smile\r\n      but dared not even think of doing so. He made a piteous, frightened face\r\n      and bent down.\n“I could not, on my honor. But how is Pétya?”\n“All right now. Come along! I wonder you’re not ashamed! If only you could\r\n      see what I was like without you, how I suffered!”\n“You are well?”\n“Come, come!” she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went to their\r\n      rooms.\nWhen Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the nursery\r\n      holding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right palm and\r\n      dandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby’s broad face\r\n      with its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since over and there was\r\n      bright, joyous sunshine on Natásha’s face as she gazed tenderly at her\r\n      husband and child.\n“And have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?” she\r\n      asked.\n“Yes, capitally.”\n“You see, he holds it up.” (She meant the baby’s head.) “But how he did\r\n      frighten me... You’ve seen the princess? Is it true she’s in love with\r\n      that...”\n“Yes, just fancy...”\nAt that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the baby on\r\n      his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries. But in\r\n      spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby with\r\n      the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his attention.\n“How sweet!” said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the baby.\r\n      “Now, Nicholas,” she added, turning to her husband, “I can’t understand\r\n      how it is you don’t see the charm of these delicious marvels.”\n“I don’t and can’t,” replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby. “A lump\r\n      of flesh. Come along, Pierre!”\n“And yet he’s such an affectionate father,” said Countess Mary,\r\n      vindicating her husband, “but only after they are a year old or so...”\n“Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly,” said Natásha. “He says his hand is\r\n      just made for a baby’s seat. Just look!”\n“Only not for this...” Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and\r\n      shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse."

    "text": "As in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several perfectly\r\n      distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole, though each\r\n      retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others. Every\r\n      event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all\r\n      these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve\r\n      over that occurrence independently of the others.\nFor instance, Pierre’s return was a joyful and important event and they\r\n      all felt it to be so.\nThe servants—the most reliable judges of their masters because they\r\n      judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their\r\n      acts and way of life—were glad of Pierre’s return because they knew\r\n      that when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to\r\n      attend to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also\r\n      because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays.\nThe children and their governesses were glad of Pierre’s return because no\r\n      one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did. He\r\n      alone could play on the clavichord thatécossaise(his only piece) to\r\n      which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt sure\r\n      he had brought presents for them all.\nYoung Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent, with\r\n      curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because Uncle\r\n      Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate\r\n      affection. No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre whom he saw\r\n      only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up had done her\r\n      utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and little Nicholas\r\n      did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of contempt. Pierre,\r\n      however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or a Knight of St.\r\n      George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned, wise, and kind\r\n      like Pierre. In Pierre’s presence his face always shone with pleasure and\r\n      he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a\r\n      single word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by\r\n      himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had said.\r\n      Pierre’s past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which young\r\n      Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had\r\n      overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Platón Karatáev (of\r\n      whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Natásha (of whom the lad was\r\n      also particularly fond), and especially Pierre’s friendship with the\r\n      father whom Nicholas could not remember—all this made Pierre in his\r\n      eyes a hero and a saint.\nFrom broken remarks about Natásha and his father, from the emotion with\r\n      which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent\r\n      tenderness with which Natásha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just\r\n      beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had\r\n      loved Natásha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father\r\n      whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be\r\n      pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears\r\n      of sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had arrived.\nThe guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite\r\n      any company he was in.\nThe grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were pleased\r\n      to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and\r\n      peacefully.\nThe old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and\r\n      especially that Natásha would now be herself again.\nPierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste\r\n      to satisfy all their expectations.\nThough the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid\r\n      of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting his\r\n      mother—and brother-in-law’s commissions, nor the dress material for\r\n      a present to Belóva, nor toys for his wife’s nephews. In the early days of\r\n      his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him\r\n      not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he had\r\n      been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot\r\n      everything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that Natásha\r\n      asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others only when\r\n      he himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an unexpected and\r\n      childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house,\r\n      and never forgot anything. If he now incurred Natásha’s censure it was\r\n      only for buying too many and too expensive things. To her other defects\r\n      (as most people thought them, but which to Pierre were qualities) of\r\n      untidiness and neglect of herself, she now added stinginess.\nFrom the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing\r\n      entailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he spent\r\n      only half as much as before, and that his affairs—which had been in\r\n      disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wife’s debts—had\r\n      begun to improve.\nLife was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive luxury,\r\n      the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no longer his nor\r\n      did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had now been settled once\r\n      for all till death and that to change it was not in his power, and so that\r\n      way of life proved economical.\nWith a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.\n“What do you think of this?” said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a\r\n      shopman.\nNatásha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her\r\n      lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he\r\n      showed her.\n“That’s for Belóva? Excellent!” She felt the quality of the material. “It\r\n      was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?”\nPierre told her the price.\n“Too dear!” Natásha remarked. “How pleased the children will be and Mamma\r\n      too! Only you need not have bought me this,” she added, unable to suppress\r\n      a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls, of a kind\r\n      then just coming into fashion.\n“Adèle tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it,” returned Pierre.\n“When am I to wear it?” and Natásha stuck it in her coil of hair. “When I\r\n      take little Másha into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable again by\r\n      then. Well, let’s go now.”\nAnd collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to the\r\n      old countess’ rooms.\nThe countess was sitting with her companion Belóva, playing grand-patience\r\n      as usual, when Pierre and Natásha came into the drawing room with parcels\r\n      under their arms.\nThe countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a\r\n      frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip had\r\n      sunk in, and her eyes were dim.\nAfter the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she felt\r\n      herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim\r\n      or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept awake, but did\r\n      notlive. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted nothing from life\r\n      but tranquillity, and that tranquillity only death could give her. But\r\n      until death came she had to go on living, that is, to use her vital\r\n      forces. A peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people\r\n      was particularly evident in her. Her life had no external aims—only\r\n      a need to exercise her various functions and inclinations was apparent.\r\n      She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep, work, give vent to her anger,\r\n      and so on, merely because she had a stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and\r\n      a liver. She did these things not under any external impulse as people in\r\n      the full vigor of life do, when behind the purpose for which they strive\r\n      that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed. She talked only\r\n      because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs. She cried\r\n      as a child does, because her nose had to be cleared, and so on. What for\r\n      people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a\r\n      pretext.\nThus in the morning—especially if she had eaten anything rich the\r\n      day before—she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the\r\n      handiest pretext Belóva’s deafness.\nShe would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end\r\n      of the room.\n“It seems a little warmer today, my dear,” she would murmur.\nAnd when Belóva replied: “Oh yes, they’ve come,” she would mutter angrily:\r\n      “O Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!”\nAnother pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp\r\n      or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face would\r\n      grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when Belóva would\r\n      again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countess’ face yellow. Just as she\r\n      needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her\r\n      still-existing faculty of thinking—and the pretext for that was a\r\n      game of patience. When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be the\r\n      pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health would be\r\n      the pretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the pretext\r\n      would be Countess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise, which was\r\n      usually toward seven o’clock when she had had an after-dinner rest in a\r\n      darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over\r\n      and over again to the same audience.\nThe old lady’s condition was understood by the whole household though no\r\n      one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible effort to satisfy\r\n      her needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between\r\n      Nicholas, Pierre, Natásha, and Countess Mary was the common understanding\r\n      of her condition expressed.\nBut those glances expressed something more: they said that she had played\r\n      her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self, that we\r\n      must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to her, to\r\n      restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life\r\n      as themselves, but now so much to be pitied.“Memento mori,”said these glances.\nOnly the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the\r\n      little children failed to understand this and avoided her."

    "text": "When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one\r\n      of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing\r\n      patience, and so—though by force of habit she greeted him with the\r\n      words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an absence:\r\n      “High time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting for you.\r\n      Well, thank God!” and received her presents with another customary remark:\r\n      “It’s not the gift that’s precious, my dear, but that you give it to me,\r\n      an old woman...”—yet it was evident that she was not pleased by\r\n      Pierre’s arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the\r\n      unfinished game.\nShe finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents.\r\n      They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a bright-blue\r\n      Sèvres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid, and a\r\n      gold snuffbox with the count’s portrait on the lid which Pierre had had\r\n      done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had long wished for such\r\n      a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently\r\n      at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards.\n“Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,” said she as she always did.\r\n      “But best of all you have brought yourself back—for I never saw\r\n      anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we to\r\n      do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away. Doesn’t see\r\n      anything, doesn’t remember anything,” she went on, repeating her usual\r\n      phrases. “Look, Anna Timoféevna,” she added to her companion, “see what a\r\n      box for cards my son has brought us!”\nBelóva admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.\nThough Pierre, Natásha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Denísov had much to\r\n      talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess—not\r\n      that anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so far\r\n      behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence\r\n      they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what\r\n      they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was dead and\r\n      so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to remember—yet\r\n      they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit, and\r\n      Pierre answered the countess’ questions as to whether Prince Vasíli had\r\n      aged and whether Countess Mary Alexéevna had sent greetings and still\r\n      thought of them, and other matters that interested no one and to which she\r\n      herself was indifferent.\nConversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,\r\n      continued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the family were\r\n      assembled near the round tea table at which Sónya presided beside the\r\n      samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and\r\n      their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all sat in their\r\n      accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his\r\n      tea was handed to him; Mílka, the old gray borzoi bitch (daughter of the\r\n      first Mílka), with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more\r\n      prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside him; Denísov, whose curly\r\n      hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half gray, sat beside countess\r\n      Mary with his general’s tunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat between his wife and\r\n      the old countess. He spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and\r\n      that she could understand. He told her of external social events and of\r\n      the people who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once\r\n      been a real, living, and distinct group, but who were now for the most\r\n      part scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last\r\n      ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years. But to the old\r\n      countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and\r\n      real society. Natásha saw by Pierre’s animation that his visit had been\r\n      interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before\r\n      the old countess. Denísov, not being a member of the family, did not\r\n      understand Pierre’s caution and being, as a malcontent, much interested in\r\n      what was occurring in Petersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about\r\n      what had happened in the Semënovsk regiment, then about Arakchéev, and\r\n      then about the Bible Society. Once or twice Pierre was carried away and\r\n      began to speak of these things, but Nicholas and Natásha always brought\r\n      him back to the health of Prince Iván and Countess Mary Alexéevna.\n“Well, and all this idiocy—Gossner and Tatáwinova?” Denísov asked.\r\n      “Is that weally still going on?”\n“Going on?” Pierre exclaimed. “Why more than ever!\r\n      The Bible Society is the whole government now!”\n“What is that,mon cher ami?” asked the countess, who had\r\n      finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry\r\n      after her meal. “What are you saying about the government? I don’t\r\n      understand.”\n“Well, you know,Maman,” Nicholas interposed, knowing how to translate\r\n      things into his mother’s language, “Prince Alexander Golítsyn has founded\r\n      a society and in consequence has great influence, they say.”\n“Arakchéev and Golítsyn,” incautiously remarked Pierre, “are now the whole\r\n      government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere and are\r\n      afraid of everything.”\n“Well, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most estimable man. I\r\n      used to meet him at Mary Antónovna’s,” said the countess in an offended\r\n      tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent, she went on:\r\n      “Nowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and what harm is\r\n      there in that?” and she rose (everybody else got up too) and with a severe\r\n      expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room.\nThe melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the\r\n      children’s voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly\r\n      excitement was going on there.\n“Finished, finished!” little Natásha’s gleeful yell rose above them all.\nPierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Natásha he never\r\n      lost sight of) and smiled happily.\n“That’s delightful music!” said he.\n“It means that Anna Makárovna has finished her stocking,” said Countess\r\n      Mary.\n“Oh, I’ll go and see,” said Pierre, jumping up. “You know,” he added,\r\n      stopping at the door, “why I’m especially fond of that music? It is always\r\n      the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was driving here today,\r\n      the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I entered the\r\n      anteroom I heard Andrúsha’s peals of laughter and that meant that all was\r\n      well.”\n“I know! I know that feeling,” said Nicholas. “But I mustn’t go there—those\r\n      stockings are to be a surprise for me.”\nPierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still\r\n      louder.\n“Come, Anna Makárovna,” Pierre’s voice was heard saying, “come here into\r\n      the middle of the room and at the word of command, ‘One, two,’ and when I\r\n      say ‘three’... You stand here, and you in my arms—well now! One,\r\n      two!...” said Pierre, and a silence followed: “three!” and a rapturously\r\n      breathless cry of children’s voices filled the room. “Two, two!” they\r\n      shouted.\nThis meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to herself\r\n      Anna Makárovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles, and\r\n      which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly drew, one out of the\r\n      other, in the children’s presence."

    "text": "Soon after this the children came in to say good night. They kissed\r\n      everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out.\r\n      Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the boy\r\n      to come downstairs.\n“No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,” replied\r\n      Nicholas Bolkónski also in a whisper.\n“Ma tante, please let me stay,” said he, going up to his aunt.\nHis face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary glanced\r\n      at him and turned to Pierre.\n“When you are here he can’t tear himself away,” she said.\n“I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good night!” said\r\n      Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young\r\n      Nicholas with a smile. “You and I haven’t seen anything of one another\r\n      yet.... How like he is growing, Mary!” he added, addressing Countess Mary.\n“Like my father?” asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up at Pierre\r\n      with bright, ecstatic eyes.\nPierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the children\r\n      had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork; Natásha did not\r\n      take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Denísov rose, asked for their\r\n      pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from Sónya—who sat weary but\r\n      resolute at the samovar—and questioned Pierre. The curly-headed,\r\n      delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner, starting every\r\n      now and then and muttering something to himself, and evidently\r\n      experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head, with\r\n      his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, toward the place where\r\n      Pierre sat.\nThe conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power,\r\n      in which most people see the chief interest of home politics. Denísov,\r\n      dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in\r\n      the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg which\r\n      seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what Pierre\r\n      told them.\n“One used to have to be a German—now one must dance with Tatáwinova\r\n      and Madame Kwüdener, and wead Ecka’tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they\r\n      should let that fine fellow Bonaparte loose—he’d knock all this\r\n      nonsense out of them! Fancy giving the command of the Semënov wegiment to\r\n      a fellow like that Schwa’tz!” he cried.\nNicholas, though free from Denísov’s readiness to find fault with\r\n      everything, also thought that discussion of the government was a very\r\n      serious and weighty matter, and the fact thatAhad been appointed\r\n      Minister of This andBGovernor General of That, and that the Emperor had\r\n      said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very important.\r\n      And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to\r\n      question Pierre. The questions put by these two kept the conversation from\r\n      changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government\r\n      circles.\nBut Natásha, knowing all her husband’s ways and ideas, saw that he had\r\n      long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to\r\n      another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which\r\n      he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince Theodore,\r\n      and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince Theodore had\r\n      gone.\n“What was it about?” asked Nicholas.\n“Always the same thing,” said Pierre, looking round at his listeners.\r\n      “Everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed\r\n      to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as\r\n      far as they can.”\n“What can decent men do?” Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. “What can\r\n      be done?”\n“Why, this...”\n“Come into my study,” said Nicholas.\nNatásha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now heard\r\n      the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary followed her.\r\n      The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolkónski followed them\r\n      unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a shady corner\r\n      by the window.\n“Well, what would you do?” asked Denísov.\n“Always some fantastic schemes,” said Nicholas.\n“Why this,” began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room, sometimes\r\n      stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: “the position in Petersburg is\r\n      this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He has abandoned himself\r\n      altogether to this mysticism” (Pierre could not tolerate mysticism in\r\n      anyone now). “He seeks only for peace, and only these peoplesans foi ni\r\n      loi* can give it him—people who recklessly hack at and strangle\r\n      everything—Magnítski, Arakchéev, andtutti quanti.... You will agree\r\n      that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a\r\n      quiet life, the harsher your steward was the more readily your object\r\n      might be attained,” he said to Nicholas.\n* Without faith or law.\n“Well, what does that lead up to?” said Nicholas.\n“Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in the army\r\n      nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the people are\r\n      tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and honest is\r\n      crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is strained to\r\n      such a degree that it will certainly break,” said Pierre (as those who\r\n      examine the actions of any government have always said since governments\r\n      began). “I told them just one thing in Petersburg.”\n“Told whom?”\n“Well, you know whom,” said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under his\r\n      brows. “Prince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and\r\n      philanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the\r\n      present circumstances something else is needed.”\nAt that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face\r\n      darkened and he went up to the boy.\n“Why are you here?”\n“Why? Let him be,” said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and continuing.\r\n      “That is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed. When you stand\r\n      expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment, when everyone is\r\n      expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as possible must join hands\r\n      as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity. Everything that\r\n      is young and strong is being enticed away and depraved. One is lured by\r\n      women, another by honors, a third by ambition or money, and they go over\r\n      to that camp. No independent men, such as you or I, are left. What I say\r\n      is widen the scope of our society, let themot d’ordrebe not\r\n      virtue alone but independence and action as well!”\nNicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat\r\n      down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning\r\n      more and more.\n“But action with what aim?” he cried. “And what position will you adopt\r\n      toward the government?”\n“Why, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the\r\n      government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but it\r\n      is a society of true conservatives—a society of gentlemen in the\r\n      full meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some Pugachëv or other\r\n      from killing my children and yours, and Arakchéev from sending me off to\r\n      some Military Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and\r\n      the general safety.”\n“Yes, but it’s a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one\r\n      which can only cause harm.”\n“Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe” (they did not then venture to\r\n      suggest that Russia had saved Europe) “do any harm? The Tugendbund is an\r\n      alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ preached\r\n      on the Cross.”\nNatásha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at her\r\n      husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her—that did not\r\n      even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and\r\n      that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she knew\r\n      that it sprang from Pierre’s whole soul), but it was his animated and\r\n      enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.\nThe boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down collar—whom\r\n      everyone had forgotten—gazed at Pierre with even greater and more\r\n      rapturous joy. Every word of Pierre’s burned into his heart, and with a\r\n      nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and\r\n      quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle’s table.\n“It is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German Tugendbund\r\n      was, and what I am proposing.”\n“No, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters,\r\n      but I don’t understand it and can’t even pwonounce it,”\r\n      interposed Denísov in a loud and resolute voice. “I agwee that evewything\r\n      here is wotten and howwible, but theTugendbundI don’t understand.\r\n      If we’re not satisfied, let us have abuntof our own.\r\n      That’s all wight.Je suis vot’e homme!”*\n* “I’m your man.”\nPierre smiled, Natásha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his brows\r\n      still more and began proving to Pierre that there was no prospect of any\r\n      great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his\r\n      imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties\r\n      were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This\r\n      made him still angrier, for he was fully convinced, not by reasoning but\r\n      by something within him stronger than reason, of the justice of his\r\n      opinion.\n“I will tell you this,” he said, rising and trying with nervously\r\n      twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally abandoning\r\n      the attempt. “I can’t prove it to you. You say that everything here is\r\n      rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I don’t see it. But you also say\r\n      that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter, and to that I reply:\r\n      ‘You are my best friend, as you know, but if you formed a secret society\r\n      and began working against the government—be it what it may—I\r\n      know it is my duty to obey the government. And if Arakchéev ordered me to\r\n      lead a squadron against you and cut you down, I should not hesitate an\r\n      instant, but should do it.’ And you may argue about that as you like!”\nAn awkward silence followed these words. Natásha was the first to speak,\r\n      defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense was weak and\r\n      inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was resumed, and no\r\n      longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas’ last remark.\nWhen they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolkónski went up\r\n      to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.\n“Uncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree with\r\n      you?” he asked.\nAnd Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex, and\r\n      powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this\r\n      boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said he regretted\r\n      that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to give him an\r\n      answer.\n“Yes, I think so,” he said reluctantly, and left the study.\nThe lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he\r\n      had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to Nicholas.\n“Uncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,” he said, pointing to\r\n      the broken sealing wax and pens.\nNicholas started angrily.\n“All right, all right,” he said, throwing the bits under the table.\nAnd evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned away\r\n      from the boy.\n“You ought not to have been here at all,” he said."

    "text": "The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, but turned\r\n      on the subject Nicholas liked best—recollections of 1812. Denísov\r\n      started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about\r\n      them. The family separated on the most friendly terms.\nAfter supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given\r\n      instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to the\r\n      bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her table,\r\n      writing.\n“What are you writing, Mary?” Nicholas asked.\nCountess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing would not\r\n      be understood or approved by her husband.\nShe had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at the same\r\n      time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to\r\n      tell him.\n“A diary, Nicholas,” she replied, handing him a blue exercise book filled\r\n      with her firm, bold writing.\n“A diary?” Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up the\r\n      book.\nIt was in French.\n\nDecember 4. Today when Andrúsha (her eldest boy) woke up he did not wish\r\n      to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty and\r\n      obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. Then I took the\r\n      matter in hand: I left him alone and began with nurse’s help to get the\r\n      other children up, telling him that I did not love him. For a long time he\r\n      was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in his\r\n      shirt, and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time. It was\r\n      plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me. Afterwards\r\n      in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began crying piteously\r\n      and kissing me. One can do anything with him by tenderness.\n\n“What is a ‘ticket’?” Nicholas inquired.\n“I have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how they\r\n      have behaved.”\nNicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and\r\n      continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down\r\n      everything in the children’s lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother\r\n      as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on\r\n      educational methods. They were for the most part quite insignificant\r\n      trifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either, now\r\n      that he read this diary about his children for the first time.\nUnder the date “5” was entered:\n\nMítya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding. He had\r\n      none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were\r\n      eating! I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only\r\n      develops their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this.\nNicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant eyes gazed\r\n      at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her diary? There\r\n      could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for\r\n      his wife.\nPerhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even\r\n      done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the\r\n      sole aim was the children’s moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas been\r\n      able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady, tender,\r\n      and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her\r\n      spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach, in\r\n      which she had her being.\nHe was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own\r\n      insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the\r\n      more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of\r\n      himself.\n“I quite, quite approve, my dearest!” said he with a significant look, and\r\n      after a short pause he added: “And I behaved badly today. You weren’t in\r\n      the study. We began disputing—Pierre and I—and I lost my\r\n      temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I don’t know what would become\r\n      of him if Natásha didn’t keep him in hand.... Have you any idea why he\r\n      went to Petersburg? They have formed...”\n“Yes, I know,” said Countess Mary. “Natásha told me.”\n“Well, then, you know,” Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere\r\n      recollection of their discussion, “he wanted to convince me that it is\r\n      every honest man’s duty to go against the government, and that the oath of\r\n      allegiance and duty... I am sorry you weren’t there. They all fell on me—Denísov\r\n      and Natásha... Natásha is absurd. How she rules over him! And yet there\r\n      need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only repeats\r\n      his sayings...” added Nicholas, yielding to that irresistible inclination\r\n      which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us. He forgot that\r\n      what he was saying about Natásha could have been applied word for word to\r\n      himself in relation to his wife.\n“Yes, I have noticed that,” said Countess Mary.\n“When I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he started\r\n      proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there—what would\r\n      you have said?”\n“As I see it you were quite right, and I told Natásha so. Pierre says\r\n      everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that it is our\r\n      duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there,” said Countess\r\n      Mary, “but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us, duties\r\n      indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose ourselves\r\n      to risks we must not risk our children.”\n“Yes, that’s it! That’s just what I said to him,” put in Nicholas, who\r\n      fancied he really had said it. “But they insisted on their own view: love\r\n      of one’s neighbor and Christianity—and all this in the presence of\r\n      young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.”\n“Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,”\r\n       said Countess Mary. “He is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I neglect\r\n      him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while he has no\r\n      one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts.”\n“Well, I don’t think you need reproach yourself on his account. All that\r\n      the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for\r\n      him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This\r\n      evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancy—as we\r\n      were going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table\r\n      to bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an\r\n      untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!” repeated Nicholas, who at heart was not\r\n      fond of Nicholas Bolkónski but was always anxious to recognize that he was\r\n      a fine lad.\n“Still, I am not the same as his own mother,” said Countess Mary. “I feel\r\n      I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am dreadfully\r\n      afraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions.”\n“Well it won’t be for long. Next summer I’ll take him to Petersburg,” said\r\n      Nicholas. “Yes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,” he\r\n      continued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently\r\n      disturbed him. “Well, what business is it of mine what goes on there—whether\r\n      Arakchéev is bad, and all that? What business was it of mine when I\r\n      married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with prison, and had\r\n      a mother who could not see or understand it? And then there are you and\r\n      the children and our affairs. Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the\r\n      farm or in the office from morning to night? No, but I know I must work to\r\n      comfort my mother, to repay you, and not to leave the children such\r\n      beggars as I was.”\nCountess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and\r\n      that he attached too much importance to these matters. But she knew she\r\n      must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only took his\r\n      hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation\r\n      of his thoughts, and after a few minutes’ reflection continued to think\r\n      aloud.\n“You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofánych” (this was his overseer)\r\n      “came back from the Tambóv estate and told me they are already\r\n      offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest.”\nAnd with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of\r\n      repurchasing Otrádnoe before long, and added: “Another ten years of life\r\n      and I shall leave the children... in an excellent position.”\nCountess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told her.\r\n      She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her\r\n      what he had been saying, and be vexed if he noticed that she had been\r\n      thinking about something else. But she had to force herself to attend, for\r\n      what he was saying did not interest her at all. She looked at him and did\r\n      not think, but felt, about something different. She felt a submissive\r\n      tender love for this man who would never understand all that she\r\n      understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and\r\n      added a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this feeling which\r\n      absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her\r\n      husband’s plans, thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying\r\n      flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew. Her husband’s account\r\n      of the boy’s agitation while Pierre was speaking struck her forcibly, and\r\n      various traits of his gentle, sensitive character recurred to her mind;\r\n      and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children. She\r\n      did not compare them with him, but compared her feeling for them with her\r\n      feeling for him, and felt with regret that there was something lacking in\r\n      her feeling for young Nicholas.\nSometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference\r\n      in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in\r\n      her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible—in this life\r\n      to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all her neighbors,\r\n      as Christ loved mankind. Countess Mary’s soul always strove toward the\r\n      infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could therefore never be at\r\n      peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret suffering of a soul\r\n      burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas gazed at her. “O God!\r\n      What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like\r\n      that?” thought he, and placing himself before the icon he began to say his\r\n      evening prayers."

    "text": "Natásha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband and\r\n      wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity,\r\n      understanding and expressing each other’s thoughts in ways contrary to all\r\n      rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in a\r\n      quite peculiar way. Natásha was so used to this kind of talk with her\r\n      husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong\r\n      between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning. When he began\r\n      proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly and she, led on by\r\n      his example, began to do the same, she knew that they were on the verge of\r\n      a quarrel.\nFrom the moment they were alone and Natásha came up to him with wide-open\r\n      happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom, saying:\r\n      “Now you are all mine, mine! You won’t escape!”—from that moment\r\n      this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to\r\n      them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the\r\n      same time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a\r\n      clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they\r\n      fully understood one another.\nJust as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and contradictory,\r\n      except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this intercourse contrary\r\n      to all laws of reason, the words themselves were not consecutive and clear\r\n      but only the feeling that prompted them.\nNatásha spoke to Pierre about her brother’s life and doings, of how she\r\n      had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of how she was\r\n      fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way better than\r\n      herself. In saying this Natásha was sincere in acknowledging Mary’s\r\n      superiority, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on Pierre\r\n      that he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all other women,\r\n      and that now, especially after having seen many women in Petersburg, he\r\n      should tell her so afresh.\nPierre, answering Natásha’s words, told her how intolerable it had been\r\n      for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.\n“I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,” he said. “It was\r\n      simply dull. Besides, I was very busy.”\nNatásha looked intently at him and went on:\n“Mary is so splendid,” she said. “How she understands children! It is as\r\n      if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance, Mítya was\r\n      naughty...”\n“How like his father he is,” Pierre interjected.\nNatásha knew why he mentioned Mítya’s likeness to Nicholas: the\r\n      recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and he\r\n      wanted to know what Natásha thought of it.\n“Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally\r\n      accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line,”\r\n       said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.\n“No, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are an\r\n      amusement—almost a pastime,” said Pierre. “For instance, he is\r\n      collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he\r\n      has read what he had already bought—Sismondi and Rousseau and\r\n      Montesquieu,” he added with a smile. “You know how much I...” he began to\r\n      soften down what he had said; but Natásha interrupted him to show that\r\n      this was unnecessary.\n“So you say ideas are an amusement to him....”\n“Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg I saw\r\n      everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is mere\r\n      amusement.”\n“Ah, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there when you met the children,” said Natásha.\r\n      “Which was most delighted? Lisa, I’m sure.”\n“Yes,” Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind. “Nicholas\r\n      says we ought not to think. But I can’t help it. Besides, when I was in\r\n      Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go\r\n      to pieces without me—everyone was pulling his own way. But I\r\n      succeeded in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear and simple.\r\n      You see, I don’t say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be\r\n      mistaken. What I say is: ‘Join hands, you who love the right, and let\r\n      there be but one banner—that of active virtue.’ Prince Sergéy is a\r\n      fine fellow and clever.”\nNatásha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre’s idea, but\r\n      one thing disconcerted her. “Can a man so important and necessary to\r\n      society be also my husband? How did this happen?” She wished to express\r\n      this doubt to him. “Now who could decide whether he is really cleverer\r\n      than all the others?” she asked herself, and passed in review all those\r\n      whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one\r\n      he had respected so highly as Platón Karatáev.\n“Do you know what I am thinking about?” she asked. “About Platón Karatáev.\r\n      Would he have approved of you now, do you think?”\nPierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood his wife’s\r\n      line of thought.\n“Platón Karatáev?” he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely trying\r\n      to imagine Karatáev’s opinion on the subject. “He would not have\r\n      understood... yet perhaps he would.”\n“I love you awfully!” Natásha suddenly said. “Awfully, awfully!”\n“No, he would not have approved,” said Pierre, after reflection. “What he\r\n      would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious to\r\n      find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should have\r\n      been proud to let him see us. There now—you talk of my absence, but\r\n      you wouldn’t believe what a special feeling I have for you after a\r\n      separation....”\n“Yes, I should think...” Natásha began.\n“No, it’s not that. I never leave off loving you. And one\r\n      couldn’t love more, but this is something special.... Yes, of\r\n      course—” he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.\n“What nonsense it is,” Natásha suddenly exclaimed, “about honeymoons, and\r\n      that the greatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, now is the best\r\n      of all. If only you did not go away! Do you remember how we quarreled? And\r\n      it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we quarreled about—I\r\n      don’t even remember!”\n“Always about the same thing,” said Pierre with a smile. “Jealo...”\n“Don’t say it! I can’t bear it!” Natásha cried, and her eyes glittered\r\n      coldly and vindictively. “Did you see her?” she added, after a pause.\n“No, and if I had I shouldn’t have recognized her.”\nThey were silent for a while.\n“Oh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at\r\n      you,” Natásha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come\r\n      over them. “You are as like him as two peas—like the boy.” (She\r\n      meant her little son.) “Oh, it’s time to go to him.... The milk’s come....\r\n      But I’m sorry to leave you.”\nThey were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one another\r\n      at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with\r\n      self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natásha with a quiet, happy smile.\r\n      Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other\r\n      continue.\n“No. What did you say? Go on, go on.”\n“No, you go on, I was talking nonsense,” said Natásha.\nPierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his complacent\r\n      reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed to him\r\n      that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of Russian society\r\n      and to the whole world.\n“I only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always simple\r\n      ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united and constitute a\r\n      power, then honest folk must do the same. Now that’s simple enough.”\n“Yes.”\n“And what were you going to say?”\n“I? Only nonsense.”\n“But all the same?”\n“Oh nothing, only a trifle,” said Natásha, smiling still more brightly.\r\n      “I only wanted to tell you about Pétya: today nurse was coming to take him\r\n      from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me. I’m sure he\r\n      thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now he’s crying. Well,\r\n      good-by!” and she left the room.\n\nMeanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkónski’s bedroom a little lamp\r\n      was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark and they could not\r\n      cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his Roman\r\n      nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring. Little Nicholas, who had just\r\n      waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him with\r\n      wide-open eyes. He had awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed that\r\n      he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in his\r\n      Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white slanting\r\n      lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and\r\n      which Dessalles calledles fils de la Vièrge. In front was Glory, which\r\n      was similar to those threads but rather thicker. He and Pierre were borne\r\n      along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their goal. Suddenly the\r\n      threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it grew\r\n      difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before them in a stern and\r\n      threatening attitude.\n“Have you done this?” he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and\r\n      pens. “I loved you, but I have orders from Arakchéev and will kill the\r\n      first of you who moves forward.” Little Nicholas turned to look at Pierre\r\n      but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his father—Prince\r\n      Andrew—and his father had neither shape nor form, but he existed,\r\n      and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love: he felt\r\n      himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father caressed and pitied him.\r\n      But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror seized young\r\n      Nicholas and he awoke.\n“My father!” he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince\r\n      Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) “My\r\n      father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle\r\n      Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned his\r\n      hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know they want\r\n      me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have finished learning,\r\n      and then I will do something. I only pray God that something may happen to\r\n      me such as happened to Plutarch’s men, and I will act as they did. I will\r\n      do better. Everyone shall know me, love me, and be delighted with me!” And\r\n      suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry.\n“Are you ill?” he heard Dessalles’ voice asking.\n“No,” answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.\n“He is good and kind and I am fond of him!” he thought of Dessalles. “But\r\n      Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father? Oh, Father,\r\n      Father! Yes, I will do something with which evenhewould be\r\n      satisfied....”"

    "text": "History is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize and put into\r\n      words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single\r\n      nation, appears impossible.\nThe ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe\r\n      and seize the apparently elusive—the life of a people. They\r\n      described the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded\r\n      the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole\r\n      nation.\nThe question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by\r\n      what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients met\r\n      by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a\r\n      chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish\r\n      ends that were predestined.\nFor the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct\r\n      participation of the Deity in human affairs.\nModern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.\nIt would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man’s\r\n      subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations\r\n      are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but\r\n      the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having\r\n      in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them in\r\n      practice.\nInstead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the\r\n      will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with\r\n      extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various kinds,\r\n      from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the former\r\n      divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations, which\r\n      ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity,\r\n      modern history has postulated its own aims—the welfare of the\r\n      French, German, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the\r\n      welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually meant\r\n      that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large\r\n      continent.\nModern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing\r\n      them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has obliged the\r\n      historians, after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the\r\n      kings and the “fate” of the ancients, to reach the same conclusion by\r\n      another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided by individual men,\r\n      and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity\r\n      at large are tending.\nAt the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to\r\n      Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of\r\n      their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.\nIn the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who\r\n      in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian considers only\r\n      monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men, while another\r\n      includes also orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets).\r\n      Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led\r\n      is known to the historians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of\r\n      the Roman, Spanish, or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality,\r\n      and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called\r\n      Europe.\nIn 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed by\r\n      a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it moves eastward\r\n      and collides with a countermovement from the east westward. In 1812 it\r\n      reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with remarkable symmetry, a\r\n      countermovement occurs from east to west, attracting to it, as the first\r\n      movement had done, the nations of middle Europe. The counter movement\r\n      reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west—Paris—and\r\n      subsides.\nDuring that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left\r\n      untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions of men\r\n      migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions of Christian\r\n      men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another.\nWhat does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people burn\r\n      houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these events?\r\n      What force made men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and most\r\n      legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments\r\n      and tradition of that period.\nFor a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the\r\n      science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know\r\n      themselves.\nIf history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said\r\n      that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and directed\r\n      his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply would have\r\n      been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve in the divine\r\n      significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in it there would have\r\n      been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period, nor would there\r\n      have been any contradictions.\nBut modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the\r\n      conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity in\r\n      human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers.\nModern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what\r\n      this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these events?\r\n      Then listen:\n“Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such\r\n      mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly. His\r\n      descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly. And they had\r\n      such and such favorites and such and such mistresses. Moreover, certain\r\n      men wrote some books at that time. At the end of the eighteenth century\r\n      there were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all men\r\n      being free and equal. This caused people all over France to begin to slash\r\n      at and drown one another. They killed the king and many other people. At\r\n      that time there was in France a man of genius—Napoleon. He conquered\r\n      everybody everywhere—that is, he killed many people because he was a\r\n      great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and killed\r\n      them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to France\r\n      he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. Having become\r\n      an Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, Austria, and\r\n      Prussia. And there too he killed a great many. In Russia there was an\r\n      Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and therefore\r\n      fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him, but in\r\n      1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people. Napoleon\r\n      led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow; then he\r\n      suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, helped by the\r\n      advice of Stein and others, united Europe to arm against the disturber of\r\n      its peace. All Napoleon’s allies suddenly became his enemies and their\r\n      forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised. The Allies defeated\r\n      Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him to the\r\n      island of Elba, not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him\r\n      every respect, though five years before and one year later they all\r\n      regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand. Then Louis XVIII, who till then\r\n      had been the laughingstock both of the French and the Allies, began to\r\n      reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears before his Old Guards, renounced the\r\n      throne and went into exile. Then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists\r\n      (especially Talleyrand, who managed to sit down in a particular chair\r\n      before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in\r\n      Vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy.\r\n      Suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the\r\n      point of again ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then\r\n      Napoleon arrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been\r\n      hating him, immediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were\r\n      angry at this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated\r\n      the genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him\r\n      to the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved\r\n      France so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and\r\n      bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction occurred\r\n      and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects.”\nIt would be a mistake to think that this is ironic—a caricature of\r\n      the historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of\r\n      the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, whichallthe\r\n      historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of\r\n      separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories\r\n      of thecultureof that period.\nThe strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that\r\n      modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.\nIf the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of\r\n      humanity and of the peoples, the first question—in the absence of a\r\n      reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible—is: what is the\r\n      power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies\r\n      either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very proud,\r\n      or that certain writers wrote certain books.\nAll that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not\r\n      what was asked. Allthatwould be interesting if we recognized a divine\r\n      power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations\r\n      through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such a\r\n      power, and therefore before speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and\r\n      authors, we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men\r\n      and the movement of the nations.\nIf instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it should be\r\n      explained in what this new force consists, for the whole interest of\r\n      history lies precisely in that force.\nHistory seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to\r\n      everyone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone\r\n      reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force,\r\n      so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really quite well\r\n      known to everybody."

    "text": "What force moves the nations?\nBiographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this\r\n      force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration events\r\n      occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in general of\r\n      the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind of historian to\r\n      the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only\r\n      as long as there is but one historian to each event. As soon as historians\r\n      of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same\r\n      event, the replies they give immediately lose all meaning, for this force\r\n      is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite\r\n      contradictory ways. One historian says that an event was produced by\r\n      Napoleon’s power, another that it was produced by Alexander’s, a third\r\n      that it was due to the power of some other person. Besides this,\r\n      historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as\r\n      to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based.\r\n      Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon’s power was based on his virtue\r\n      and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was based on his trickery and\r\n      deception of the people. So the historians of this class, by mutually\r\n      destroying one another’s positions, destroy the understanding of the force\r\n      which produces events, and furnish no reply to history’s essential\r\n      question.\nWriters of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to\r\n      recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians’ view of the force\r\n      which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in\r\n      heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously\r\n      directed forces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a people, a\r\n      general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one\r\n      man, but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event.\nAccording to this view the power of historical personages, represented as\r\n      the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded as a\r\n      force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal historians\r\n      still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces\r\n      events, and treat it as their cause. In their exposition, an historic\r\n      character is first the product of his time, and his power only the\r\n      resultant of various forces, and then his power is itself a force\r\n      producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one\r\n      time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of\r\n      1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812\r\n      and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon’s\r\n      misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their\r\n      development by Napoleon’s caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the\r\n      general temper of the age produced Napoleon’s power. But Napoleon’s power\r\n      suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age.\nThis curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at\r\n      every step, but the universal historians’ accounts are all made up of a\r\n      chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after\r\n      entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.\nTo find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the\r\n      sum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never\r\n      observed by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant\r\n      forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient\r\n      components, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action.\nSpecialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration\r\n      of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will\r\n      of Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this opinion\r\n      of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and\r\n      the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside\r\n      Alexander’s will—such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame\r\n      de Staël, Talleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian\r\n      evidently decomposes Alexander’s power into the components: Talleyrand,\r\n      Chateaubriand, and the rest—but the sum of the components, that is,\r\n      the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Staël, and the\r\n      others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon of\r\n      millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand,\r\n      Madame de Staël, and others spoke certain words to one another only\r\n      affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of\r\n      millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the\r\n      submission of millions of people resulted—that is, how component\r\n      forces equal to oneAgave a resultant equal to a thousand timesA—the historian is again obliged to fall back on power—the\r\n      force he had denied—and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces,\r\n      that is, he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And\r\n      that is just what the universal historians do, and consequently they not only\r\n      contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.\nPeasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to\r\n      whether they want rain or fine weather: “The wind has blown the clouds\r\n      away,” or, “The wind has brought up the clouds.” And in the same way the\r\n      universal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with\r\n      their theory, say that power is the result of events, and sometimes, when\r\n      they want to prove something else, say that power produces events.\nA third class of historians—the so-called historians of culture—following\r\n      the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept\r\n      writers and ladies as forces producing events—again take that force\r\n      to be something quite different. They see it in what is called culture—in\r\n      mental activity.\nThe historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their\r\n      progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical events\r\n      may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in\r\n      such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that such and such\r\n      people wrote such and such books? Of the immense number of indications\r\n      accompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select the\r\n      indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the\r\n      cause. But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies\r\n      in intellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit that there\r\n      is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of\r\n      peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls\r\n      people’s actions, for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very\r\n      cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting from the doctrine of the\r\n      equality of man, or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the\r\n      preaching of love.\nBut even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with\r\n      which these histories are filled—admitting that nations are governed\r\n      by some undefined force called anidea—history’s essential question\r\n      still remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the\r\n      influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal\r\n      historians, another, newer force—theidea—is added, the\r\n      connection of which with the masses needs explanation. It is possible to\r\n      understand that Napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some\r\n      effort one may even conceive that Napoleon together with other influences\r\n      was the cause of an event; but how a book,Le Contrat Social, had the\r\n      effect of making Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood\r\n      without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the\r\n      event.\nUndoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously,\r\n      and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual\r\n      activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a connection\r\n      may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce, handicraft,\r\n      gardening, or anything else you please. But why intellectual activity is\r\n      considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of\r\n      the whole historical movement is hard to understand. Only the following\r\n      considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion: (1) that\r\n      history is written by learned men, and so it is natural and agreeable for\r\n      them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the\r\n      movement of all humanity, just as a similar belief is natural and\r\n      agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers (if they do not express\r\n      it, that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history), and\r\n      (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment, civilization, culture, ideas,\r\n      are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very\r\n      easy to use words having a still less definite meaning, and which can\r\n      therefore be readily introduced into any theory.\nBut not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind (which\r\n      may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the histories of\r\n      culture, to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate,\r\n      are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining\r\n      various religious, philosophic, and political doctrines as causes of\r\n      events, as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as\r\n      the campaign of 1812 for instance, they involuntarily describe it as\r\n      resulting from an exercise of power—and say plainly that that was\r\n      the result of Napoleon’s will. Speaking so, the historians of culture\r\n      involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that the new force they have\r\n      devised does not account for what happens in history, and that history can\r\n      only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not\r\n      recognize."

    "text": "A locomotive is moving. Someone asks: “What moves it?” A peasant says the\r\n      devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels\r\n      go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke\r\n      which the wind carries away.\nThe peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To\r\n      refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil, or\r\n      another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but\r\n      a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the\r\n      contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong. But the man who\r\n      says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself, for\r\n      having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the\r\n      wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the\r\n      movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he has\r\n      no right to stop in his search for the cause. The man who explains the\r\n      movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed\r\n      that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign\r\n      that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation.\nThe only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is\r\n      that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.\nThe only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that\r\n      of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples.\nYet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different\r\n      kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed. Some\r\n      see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the peasant sees the\r\n      devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting from several other\r\n      forces, like the movement of the wheels; others again as an intellectual\r\n      influence, like the smoke that is blown away.\nSo long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether Caesars,\r\n      Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories ofall,\r\n      absolutelyallthose who take part in an event, it is quite impossible to\r\n      describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force\r\n      compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end. And the only\r\n      such conception known to historians is that of power.\nThis conception is the one handle by means of which the material of\r\n      history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who breaks\r\n      that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method of\r\n      treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one possible\r\n      way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception of power as an\r\n      explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal\r\n      historians and historians of culture themselves, for they professedly\r\n      reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step.\nIn dealing with humanity’s inquiry, the science of history up to now is\r\n      like money in circulation—paper money and coin. The biographies and\r\n      special national histories are like paper money. They can be used and can\r\n      circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even\r\n      advantageously, as long as no one asks what is the security behind them.\r\n      You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and\r\n      such histories as Thiers’ will be interesting and instructive and may\r\n      perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real\r\n      value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much of\r\n      it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also doubts\r\n      concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many\r\n      of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone\r\n      inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?—that is, wants to\r\n      exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual\r\n      comprehension.\nThe writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like\r\n      people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to substitute\r\n      for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold. It\r\n      may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more than that. Paper money\r\n      may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal\r\n      that have no value but merely jingle. As gold is gold only if it is\r\n      serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use, so universal\r\n      historians will be valuable only when they can reply to history’s\r\n      essential question: what is power? The universal historians give\r\n      contradictory replies to that question, while the historians of culture\r\n      evade it and answer something quite different. And as counters of\r\n      imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to\r\n      accept them as gold, or among those who do not know the nature of gold, so\r\n      universal historians and historians of culture, not answering humanity’s\r\n      essential question, serve as currency for some purposes of their own, only\r\n      in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what\r\n      they call “serious reading.”"

    "text": "Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine\r\n      subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection\r\n      of that man’s will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions\r\n      take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return\r\n      to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human\r\n      affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing\r\n      historical events and termed “power.”\nA return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and so\r\n      it is essential to explain what is meant by power.\nNapoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so accustomed\r\n      to that idea and have become so used to it that the question: why did six\r\n      hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered certain words,\r\n      seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he ordered was done.\nThis reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given\r\n      him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to\r\n      determine what is this power of one man over others.\nIt cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one—a\r\n      domination based on the application or threat of physical force, like the\r\n      power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force, as in\r\n      their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in\r\n      history are heroes, that is, men gifted with a special strength of soul\r\n      and mind called genius. This power cannot be based on the predominance of\r\n      moral strength, for, not to mention heroes such as Napoleon about whose\r\n      moral qualities opinions differ widely, history shows us that neither a\r\n      Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over millions of people, had any\r\n      particular moral qualities, but on the contrary were generally morally\r\n      weaker than any of the millions they ruled over.\nIf the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral\r\n      qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for\r\n      elsewhere—in the relation to the people of the man who wields the\r\n      power.\nAnd that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence, that\r\n      exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history’s understanding\r\n      of power for true gold.\nPower is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or\r\n      tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.\nIn the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a\r\n      state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be\r\n      arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that\r\n      definition of power needs explanation.\nThe science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients\r\n      regarded fire—namely, as something existing absolutely. But for\r\n      history, the state and power are merely phenomena, just as for modern\r\n      physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon.\nFrom this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that\r\n      held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how\r\n      in its opinion power should be constituted and what power—existing\r\n      immutably outside time—is, but to history’s questions about the\r\n      meaning of the mutations of powerintime it can answer nothing.\nIf power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler,\r\n      was Pugachëv a representative of the will of the people? If not, then why\r\n      was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when he was taken prisoner\r\n      at Boulogne, and why, later on, were those criminals whom he arrested?\nDo palace revolutions—in which sometimes only two or three people\r\n      take part—transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In\r\n      international relations, is the will of the people also transferred to\r\n      their conqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine\r\n      transferred to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people\r\n      transferred to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the French\r\n      went to fight the Austrians?\nTo these questions three answers are possible:\nEither to assume (1) that the will of the people is always unconditionally\r\n      transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and that therefore\r\n      every emergence of a new power, every struggle against the power once\r\n      appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real\r\n      power; or (2) that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers\r\n      conditionally, under definite and known conditions, and to show that all\r\n      limitations, conflicts, and even destructions of power result from a\r\n      nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was\r\n      entrusted to them; or (3) that the will of the people is delegated to the\r\n      rulers conditionally, but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite,\r\n      and that the appearance of several authorities, their struggles and their\r\n      falls, result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers\r\n      of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred\r\n      from some people to others.\nAnd these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the\r\n      relation of the people to their rulers.\nSome historians—those biographical and specialist historians already\r\n      referred to—in their simplicity failing to understand the question\r\n      of the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of the\r\n      people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons, and therefore\r\n      when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be\r\n      the one absolute and real power, and that any other force opposing this is\r\n      not a power but a violation of power—mere violence.\nTheir theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history, has\r\n      the inconvenience—in application to complex and stormy periods in\r\n      the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and\r\n      struggle with one another—that a Legitimist historian will prove\r\n      that the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere\r\n      infringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will\r\n      prove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the\r\n      real power, and that all the others were violations of power. Evidently\r\n      the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually\r\n      contradictory can only satisfy young children.\nRecognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of historians\r\n      say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people\r\n      to their rulers, and that historical leaders have power only conditionally\r\n      on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit\r\n      agreement prescribed to them. But what this program consists in these\r\n      historians do not say, or if they do they continually contradict one\r\n      another.\nEach historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation’s\r\n      progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom, or\r\n      enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not to\r\n      mention the historians’ contradictions as to the nature of this program—or\r\n      even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists—the\r\n      facts of history almost always contradict that theory. If the conditions\r\n      under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth, freedom, and\r\n      enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis XIV and Iván the\r\n      Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are\r\n      executed by their people? To this question historians reply that Louis\r\n      XIV’s activity, contrary to the program, reacted on Louis XVI. But why did\r\n      it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV—why should it react just on\r\n      Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such reactions? To these\r\n      questions there are and can be no answers. Equally little does this view\r\n      explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn\r\n      from certain rulers and their heirs, and then suddenly during a period of\r\n      fifty years is transferred to the Convention, to the Directory, to\r\n      Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, to Charles X,\r\n      to Louis Philippe, to a Republican government, and to Napoleon III. When\r\n      explaining these rapid transfers of the people’s will from one individual\r\n      to another, especially in view of international relations, conquests, and\r\n      alliances, the historians are obliged to admit that some of these\r\n      transfers are not normal delegations of the people’s will but are\r\n      accidents dependent on cunning, on mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness\r\n      of a diplomatist, a ruler, or a party leader. So that the greater part of\r\n      the events of history—civil wars, revolutions, and conquests—are\r\n      presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of\r\n      the people’s will, but as results of the ill-directed will of one or more\r\n      individuals, that is, once again, as usurpations of power. And so these\r\n      historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to\r\n      the theory.\nThese historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some plants\r\n      grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all that\r\n      grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the\r\n      mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer\r\n      resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.\nHistorians of the third class assume that the will of the people is\r\n      transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the conditions\r\n      are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have power only\r\n      because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to\r\n      them.\nBut in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic\r\n      leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have those\r\n      leaders?\nThe leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people: the\r\n      activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.\nBut in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the\r\n      leaders serves as an expression of the people’s will or only some part of\r\n      it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the\r\n      people’s will, as some historians suppose, then all the details of the\r\n      court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or a Catherine\r\n      serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident nonsense; but if\r\n      it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader\r\n      which serves to express the people’s life, as other so-called\r\n      “philosophical” historians believe, then to determine which side of the\r\n      activity of a leader expresses the nation’s life, we have first of all to\r\n      know in what the nation’s life consists.\nMet by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure,\r\n      impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable\r\n      occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanity’s\r\n      movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the\r\n      historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress, civilization,\r\n      and culture. Postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement\r\n      of humanity, the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of\r\n      monuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals, authors, reformers,\r\n      popes, and journalists, to the extent to which in their opinion these\r\n      persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction. But as it is in no way\r\n      proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom, equality,\r\n      enlightenment, or civilization, and as the connection of the people with\r\n      the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary\r\n      assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to\r\n      the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the activity of the millions\r\n      who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture, and destroy one another\r\n      never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who\r\n      did not burn houses, practice agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.\nHistory proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples of the\r\n      west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward\r\n      explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their mistresses and\r\n      ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Diderot, Beaumarchais,\r\n      and others?\nIs the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazán and Siberia\r\n      expressed by details of the morbid character of Iván the Terrible and by\r\n      his correspondence with Kúrbski?\nIs the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by\r\n      the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies?\r\n      For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without leaders,\r\n      with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains\r\n      incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that\r\n      movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade—the\r\n      deliverance of Jerusalem—had been clearly defined by historic\r\n      leaders. Popes, kings, and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy\r\n      Land; but the people did not go, for the unknown cause which had\r\n      previously impelled them to go no longer existed. The history of the\r\n      Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the\r\n      peoples. And the history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained\r\n      the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of\r\n      the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown.\nStill less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the\r\n      life of the peoples.\nThe history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life\r\n      and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had a hot\r\n      temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was\r\n      suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after\r\n      the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the\r\n      French Revolution they guillotined one another.\nIf we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest\r\n      historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not the\r\n      history of the life of the peoples."

    "text": "The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for\r\n      the connection between those men and the nations has not been found. The\r\n      theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective\r\n      will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis\r\n      unconfirmed by the experience of history.\nThe theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to\r\n      historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence\r\n      and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as\r\n      soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur—that is, as soon\r\n      as history begins—that theory explains nothing.\nThe theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the\r\n      people’s will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.\nWhatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the theory\r\n      can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the\r\n      collective will was transferred to him.\nThe replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies\r\n      of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no\r\n      attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of\r\n      the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute the\r\n      direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.\n“The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and\r\n      the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader.”\r\n       This is what historians of the first class say—those who assume the\r\n      unconditional transference of the people’s will.\n“If the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the\r\n      collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to\r\n      another, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the\r\n      direction selected by the whole herd.” Such is the reply historians who\r\n      assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under\r\n      conditions which they regard as known. (With this method of observation it\r\n      often happens that the observer, influenced by the direction he himself\r\n      prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the people’s change of\r\n      direction, are no longer in front, but on one side, or even in the rear.)\n“If the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the\r\n      whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow a\r\n      given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have\r\n      attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd we must\r\n      watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of\r\n      the herd.” So say the third class of historians who regard all historical\r\n      persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of their age.\nThe theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic\r\n      persons is merely a paraphrase—a restatement of the question in\r\n      other words.\nWhat causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the\r\n      collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what\r\n      condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On condition\r\n      that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That is, power is\r\n      power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which we do not\r\n      understand.\nIf the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning, then\r\n      having subjected to criticism the explanation of “power” that juridical\r\n      science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and\r\n      has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man has, besides\r\n      abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his reflections. And\r\n      experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually\r\n      existing phenomenon.\nNot to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of\r\n      men can do without the conception of power, the existence of power is\r\n      proved both by history and by observing contemporary events.\nWhenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose will the\r\n      event seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree and the\r\n      French go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and an\r\n      army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters Russia.\r\n      Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the Bourbons.\r\n      Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the\r\n      will of one or of several men who have decreed it.\nThe historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine\r\n      intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in the\r\n      expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that supposition\r\n      is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.\nOn the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man’s will—his\r\n      words—are only part of the general activity expressed in an event,\r\n      as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without assuming an\r\n      incomprehensible, supernatural force—a miracle—one cannot\r\n      admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions\r\n      of men. On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the\r\n      cause of events, history shows that the expression of the will of\r\n      historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that is\r\n      to say, their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very\r\n      opposite of what they order occurs.\nWithout admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot\r\n      regard “power” as the cause of events.\nPower, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that\r\n      exists between the expression of someone’s will and the execution of that\r\n      will by others.\nTo explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a\r\n      conception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the\r\n      Deity.\nIf the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history\r\n      tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not\r\n      caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event. But\r\n      speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in\r\n      time and in relation to one another, to explain the connection of commands\r\n      with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that takes place:\r\n      the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person\r\n      who commands, and (2) the inevitability of the connection between the\r\n      person commanding and those who execute his command."

    "text": "Only the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time, can\r\n      relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or\r\n      centuries, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can by His sole\r\n      will determine the direction of humanity’s movement; but man acts in time\r\n      and himself takes part in what occurs.\nReinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no\r\n      command can be executed without some preceding order having been given\r\n      rendering the execution of the last command possible.\nNo command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series of\r\n      occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers to a\r\n      whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.\nWhen, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war, we\r\n      combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive\r\n      commands dependent one on another. Napoleon could not have commanded an\r\n      invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered such and such papers\r\n      to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg; tomorrow such and\r\n      such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the commissariat, and so\r\n      on and so on—millions of commands, which formed a whole series\r\n      corresponding to a series of events which brought the French armies into\r\n      Russia.\nIf throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of\r\n      England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort, and\r\n      yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but\r\n      undertook an expedition into Russia, with which country he considered it\r\n      desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly expressed)—this\r\n      came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events\r\n      in the first case, but did so correspond in the latter.\nFor an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should\r\n      order what can be executed. But to know what can and what cannot be\r\n      executed is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleon’s invasion of\r\n      Russia in which millions participated, but even in the simplest event, for\r\n      in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution.\r\n      Every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted. All\r\n      the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain\r\n      unexecuted. Only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series\r\n      of commands corresponding to a series of events, and are executed.\nOur false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes\r\n      it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of\r\n      thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that\r\n      event have been executed, we forget about the others that were not\r\n      executed because they could not be. Apart from that, the chief source of\r\n      our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical\r\n      accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such\r\n      for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia, is\r\n      generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that\r\n      series of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole\r\n      series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.\nWe say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In reality in\r\n      all Napoleon’s activity we never find anything resembling an expression of\r\n      that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of his will, very\r\n      variously and indefinitely directed. Amid a long series of unexecuted\r\n      orders of Napoleon’s one series, for the campaign of 1812, was carried out—not\r\n      because those orders differed in any way from the other, unexecuted orders\r\n      but because they coincided with the course of events that led the French\r\n      army into Russia; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out\r\n      not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way, but\r\n      because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil.\nSo that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events, we\r\n      find that a command can never be the cause of the event, but that a\r\n      certain definite dependence exists between the two.\nTo understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to\r\n      reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from\r\n      the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the command\r\n      himself takes part in the event.\nThis relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called\r\n      power. This relation consists in the following:\nFor common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which\r\n      regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action, the\r\n      relation between those taking part in it is always the same.\nMen uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one\r\n      another that the larger number take a more direct share, and the smaller\r\n      number a less direct share, in the collective action for which they have\r\n      combined.\nOf all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of\r\n      the most striking and definite examples is an army.\nEvery army is composed of lower grades of the service—the rank and\r\n      file—of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next\r\n      higher military rank—corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom\r\n      there are fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are still\r\n      fewer, and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in\r\n      one person.\nA military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of\r\n      which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file;\r\n      the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next\r\n      higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which will\r\n      represent the commander in chief.\nThe soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of the\r\n      cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking,\r\n      burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions from\r\n      men above him; he himself never gives an order. The noncommissioned\r\n      officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less\r\n      frequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An officer\r\n      still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more\r\n      frequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the\r\n      objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief\r\n      never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general\r\n      orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar\r\n      relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for\r\n      common activity—in agriculture, trade, and every administration.\nAnd so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a\r\n      cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in any\r\n      administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest,\r\n      we see a law by which men, to take associated action, combine in such\r\n      relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action\r\n      the less they can command and the more numerous they are, while the less\r\n      their direct participation in the action itself, the more they command and\r\n      the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to\r\n      the man at the top, who takes the least direct share in the action and\r\n      directs his activity chiefly to commanding.\nThis relation of the men who command to those they command is what\r\n      constitutes the essence of the conception called power.\nHaving restored the condition of time under which all events occur, we\r\n      find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding\r\n      series of events. Restoring the essential condition of relation between\r\n      those who command and those who execute, we find that by the very nature\r\n      of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself\r\n      and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding."

    "text": "When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes\r\n      about it, and as the event results from the collective activity of many\r\n      people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be\r\n      fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions expressed is\r\n      fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command\r\n      preceding it.\nMen are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to how and\r\n      where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens that this is done\r\n      as one of them said. Heorderedit. There we have command and power in\r\n      their primary form. The man who worked most with his hands could not think\r\n      so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or command what would\r\n      result from the common activity; while the man who commanded more would\r\n      evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal\r\n      activity.\nWhen some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim\r\n      there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their activity is\r\n      given to directing and commanding, take less part in the direct work.\nWhen a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as\r\n      it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his present activity,\r\n      and guide him in planning his future actions. Just the same is done by a\r\n      concourse of people, allowing those who do not take a direct part in the\r\n      activity to devise considerations, justifications, and surmises concerning\r\n      their collective activity.\nFor reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill one\r\n      another. And corresponding to the event its justification appears in\r\n      people’s belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for\r\n      liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one another, and this\r\n      event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a\r\n      centralization of power, resistance to Europe, and so on. Men went from\r\n      the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event was\r\n      accompanied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of England,\r\n      and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the events have\r\n      no common sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of killing a man\r\n      as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing of millions in\r\n      Russia for the humiliation of England. But these justifications have a\r\n      very necessary significance in their own day.\nThese justifications release those who produce the events from moral\r\n      responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of\r\n      a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear men’s\r\n      moral responsibilities from their path.\nWithout such justification there would be no reply to the simplest\r\n      question that presents itself when examining each historical event. How is\r\n      it that millions of men commit collective crimes—make war, commit\r\n      murder, and so on?\nWith the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe can\r\n      any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by monarchs,\r\n      ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is there any collective\r\n      action which cannot find its justification in political unity, in\r\n      patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization? So that every\r\n      event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and,\r\n      receiving a justification, presents itself as the result of the will of\r\n      one man or of several men.\nIn whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts will\r\n      always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship the movement\r\n      of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.\nOnly by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and\r\n      comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that\r\n      every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship, and\r\n      that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were\r\n      imperceptibly moving.\nWe see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical\r\n      characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that\r\n      occurs—the continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of\r\n      the essential connection of historical persons with the masses.\nWhen the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead\r\n      of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns\r\n      frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave\r\n      anticipating its movement.\nWhatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and\r\n      decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither directs\r\n      nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance seems to\r\n      us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship’s movement also.\nExamining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which,\r\n      as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed that the\r\n      events depended on those commands. But examining the events themselves and\r\n      the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people, we\r\n      have found that they and their orders were dependent on events. The\r\n      incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many commands were\r\n      issued, the event does not take place unless there are other causes for\r\n      it, but as soon as an event occurs—be it what it may—then out\r\n      of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will\r\n      always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are\r\n      related as commands to the events.\nArriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these\r\n      two essential questions of history:\n(1) What is power?\n(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?\n(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals, in which\r\n      the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and justifications\r\n      of the collective action that is performed, the less is his participation\r\n      in that action.\n(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual\r\n      activity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have\r\n      supposed, but by the activity ofallthe people who participate in the\r\n      events, and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest\r\n      direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and\r\n      vice versa.\nMorally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically it is\r\n      those who submit to the power. But as the moral activity is inconceivable\r\n      without the physical, the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in\r\n      the other but in the union of the two.\nOr in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the\r\n      phenomena we are examining.\nIn the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity—that final\r\n      limit to which in every domain of thought man’s reason arrives if it is\r\n      not playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat produces\r\n      electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another.\nSpeaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we\r\n      cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is\r\n      inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The\r\n      same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do not\r\n      know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action, people\r\n      combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and we say\r\n      that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other words\r\n      that it is a law."

    "text": "If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this\r\n      simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our\r\n      argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter\r\n      cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion\r\n      and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history, says\r\n      plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.\nThe presence of the problem of man’s free will, though unexpressed, is\r\n      felt at every step of history.\nAll seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this\r\n      question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false\r\n      path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a\r\n      solution of that question.\nIf the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he\r\n      pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.\nIf in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that\r\n      is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man’s in\r\n      violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility\r\n      of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity.\nIf there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot\r\n      exist, for then man’s will is subject to that law.\nIn this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most\r\n      ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient\r\n      times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.\nThe problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from\r\n      whatever point of view—theological, historical, ethical, or\r\n      philosophic—we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all\r\n      that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what\r\n      we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.\nThis consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and\r\n      independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only\r\n      through consciousness does he know himself.\nApart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason\r\n      is conceivable.\nTo understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be\r\n      conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as a\r\n      living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of his\r\n      volition. But his will—which forms the essence of his life—man\r\n      recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.\nIf, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed by one\r\n      and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking food, using\r\n      his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this never-varying\r\n      direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it. Were it not\r\n      free it could not be limited. A man’s will seems to him to be limited just\r\n      because he is not conscious of it except as free.\nYou say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.\r\n      Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable\r\n      demonstration of freedom.\nThat reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to\r\n      reason.\nIf the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source\r\n      of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience,\r\n      but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable.\nA series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he, as an\r\n      object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man submits to them\r\n      and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become\r\n      acquainted with them. But the same series of experiments and arguments\r\n      proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in\r\n      himself is impossible, and that his every action depends on his\r\n      organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet man\r\n      never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments. Having\r\n      learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards, a man\r\n      indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned\r\n      to be fulfilled.\nBut learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does\r\n      not and cannot believe this.\nHowever often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same\r\n      conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as\r\n      before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he\r\n      approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same\r\n      way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can\r\n      act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however incontestably reason\r\n      and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two\r\n      different courses of action in precisely the same conditions, feels that\r\n      without this irrational conception (which constitutes the essence of\r\n      freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels that however impossible it may\r\n      be, it is so, for without this conception of freedom not only would he be\r\n      unable to understand life, but he would be unable to live for a single\r\n      moment.\nHe could not live, because all man’s efforts, all his impulses to life,\r\n      are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and\r\n      obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and\r\n      disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger,\r\n      virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.\nA man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life.\nIf the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless\r\n      contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and\r\n      the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that only\r\n      proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.\nThis unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled by\r\n      experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone\r\n      without exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man\r\n      is possible constitutes the other side of the question.\nMan is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God. What\r\n      is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of man’s\r\n      freedom? That is a question for theology.\nThe actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in\r\n      statistics. What is man’s responsibility to society, the conception of\r\n      which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for\r\n      jurisprudence.\nMan’s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting\r\n      upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in\r\n      actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a question\r\n      for ethics.\nMan in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to\r\n      laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that\r\n      connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and of\r\n      humanity be regarded—as the result of the free, or as the result of\r\n      the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for history.\nOnly in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledge—thanks\r\n      to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of printed matter—has\r\n      the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the\r\n      question itself cannot exist. In our time the majority of so-called\r\n      advanced people—that is, the crowd of ignoramuses—have taken\r\n      the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a\r\n      solution of the whole problem.\nThey say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist, for\r\n      the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements\r\n      are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul and free will do\r\n      not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes.\r\n      They say this, not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same\r\n      law of necessity which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by\r\n      physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the\r\n      religions and all the thinkers, but has never been denied. They do not see\r\n      that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as\r\n      an instrument for the illumination of one side of it. For the fact that,\r\n      from the point of view of observation, reason and the will are merely\r\n      secretions of the brain, and that man following the general law may have\r\n      developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time, only explains\r\n      from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the\r\n      religious and philosophic theories—that from the point of view of\r\n      reason man is subject to the law of necessity; but it does not advance by\r\n      a hair’s breadth the solution of the question, which has another,\r\n      opposite, side, based on the consciousness of freedom.\nIf men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is as\r\n      comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain\r\n      period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is the time, in the\r\n      second case it is the origin); and the question of how man’s consciousness\r\n      of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is\r\n      subject cannot be solved by comparative physiology and zoology, for in a\r\n      frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can observe only the muscular nervous\r\n      activity, but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and\r\n      nervous activity.\nThe naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this\r\n      question, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a\r\n      church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent\r\n      of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows, icons,\r\n      woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should be delighted that from\r\n      their point of view as plasterers, everything is now so smooth and\r\n      regular."

    "text": "For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history\r\n      has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question\r\n      is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer to the\r\n      essence of man’s free will but its manifestation in the past and under\r\n      certain conditions.\nIn regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as\r\n      experimental science stands to abstract science.\nThe subject for history is not man’s will itself but our presentation of\r\n      it.\nAnd so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility\r\n      of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology,\r\n      ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a presentation of man’s life in\r\n      which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place.\nIn actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly and\r\n      definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although each\r\n      event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.\nTo solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what\r\n      constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the philosophy of\r\n      history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other\r\n      sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and\r\n      inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life under\r\n      those definitions, history should deduce a definition of the conception of\r\n      freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of\r\n      phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on\r\n      these two elements.\nWhatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we\r\n      may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man’s free will\r\n      and partly of the law of inevitability.\nWhether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the\r\n      barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someone’s action an\r\n      hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk, we are\r\n      unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and inevitability\r\n      governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us.\nOur conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to\r\n      differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but every\r\n      human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and\r\n      inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of\r\n      freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more\r\n      freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive, and\r\n      the more inevitability the less freedom.\nThe proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases\r\n      according to the point of view from which the action is regarded, but\r\n      their relation is always one of inverse proportion.\nA sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother\r\n      exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained to\r\n      discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man—seem\r\n      less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of necessity,\r\n      to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed, and\r\n      more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning, that\r\n      the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks, and so on.\r\n      Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since\r\n      lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action\r\n      more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who considers his action\r\n      after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after\r\n      it was committed. And in the same way every action of an insane,\r\n      intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable\r\n      to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action, and\r\n      seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it. In all\r\n      these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the\r\n      conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased,\r\n      according to the point of view from which the action is regarded. So that\r\n      the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of\r\n      freedom and vice versa.\nReligion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence, and\r\n      history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and\r\n      freedom.\nAll cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and\r\n      necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:\n(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds.\n(2) His relation to time.\n(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.\nThe first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man’s\r\n      relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our\r\n      understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to\r\n      everything coexisting with him. This is what makes it evident that a\r\n      drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing\r\n      on dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with\r\n      others in a thickly populated district, or of one bound by family,\r\n      official, or business duties, seem certainly less free and more subject to\r\n      necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion.\nIf we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around\r\n      him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation to\r\n      anything around him, if we see his connection with anything whatever—with\r\n      a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on which he is engaged,\r\n      even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about\r\n      him—we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him\r\n      and controls at least some side of his activity. And the more we perceive\r\n      of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and\r\n      the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases.\nThe second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the\r\n      man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the\r\n      man’s action occupies in time. That is the ground which makes the fall of\r\n      the first man, resulting in the production of the human race, appear\r\n      evidently less free than a man’s entry into marriage today. It is the\r\n      reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are\r\n      connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a\r\n      contemporary, the consequences of which are still unknown to me.\nThe degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this\r\n      respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of\r\n      the action and our judgment of it.\nIf I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same\r\n      circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly\r\n      free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in\r\n      different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had\r\n      not been committed much that resulted from it—good, agreeable, and\r\n      even essential—would not have taken place. If I reflect on an action\r\n      still more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my\r\n      action are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would\r\n      have happened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back in\r\n      memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my judgment,\r\n      the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action.\nIn history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the\r\n      part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A\r\n      contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the\r\n      known participants, but with a more remote event we already see its\r\n      inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible.\r\n      And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they\r\n      appear.\nThe Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty\r\n      conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem to us,\r\n      though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroes’ will. But\r\n      in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in\r\n      history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of Europe,\r\n      though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared as merely\r\n      due to the will of certain people. In regard to the migration of the\r\n      peoples it does not enter anyone’s head today to suppose that the\r\n      renovation of the European world depended on Attila’s caprice. The farther\r\n      back in history the object of our observation lies, the more doubtful does\r\n      the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest\r\n      the law of inevitability.\nThe third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless\r\n      chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which each phenomenon\r\n      comprehended, and therefore man’s every action, must have its definite\r\n      place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will\r\n      follow.\nThe better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, and\r\n      historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled, and\r\n      the more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological, and\r\n      historical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are\r\n      observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in\r\n      question, the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our\r\n      actions and those of others appear.\nWhen we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a crime,\r\n      a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a greater\r\n      amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we most urgently demand\r\n      the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we rate its\r\n      merit most highly. In an indifferent case we recognize in it more\r\n      individuality, originality, and independence. But if even one of the\r\n      innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain\r\n      element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime,\r\n      or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom of\r\n      the apparently original action. That a criminal was reared among\r\n      malefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father or\r\n      mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more\r\n      comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less\r\n      deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The founder of a\r\n      sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when we know how or by\r\n      what the way was prepared for his activity. If we have a large range of\r\n      examples, if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the\r\n      correlation of cause and effect in people’s actions, their actions appear\r\n      to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect\r\n      the effects with the causes. If we examined simple actions and had a vast\r\n      number of such actions under observation, our conception of their\r\n      inevitability would be still greater. The dishonest conduct of the son of\r\n      a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad\r\n      company, a drunkard’s relapse into drunkenness, and so on are actions that\r\n      seem to us less free the better we understand their cause. If the man\r\n      whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental\r\n      development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton—then, knowing\r\n      the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence\r\n      in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so little free\r\n      will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can\r\n      foretell the result.\nOn these three considerations alone is based the conception of\r\n      irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by\r\n      all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less\r\n      according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which\r\n      the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according to the\r\n      greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action\r\n      and its investigation, and according to the greater or lesser\r\n      understanding of the causes that led to the action."

    "text": "Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or\r\n      increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external\r\n      world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, and the greater or lesser\r\n      dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a man’s life.\nSo that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external\r\n      world is well known, where the time between the action and its examination\r\n      is great, and where the causes of the action are most accessible, we get\r\n      the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will.\r\n      If we examine a man little dependent on external conditions, whose action\r\n      was performed very recently, and the causes of whose action are beyond our\r\n      ken, we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of\r\n      freedom.\nIn neither case—however we may change our point of view, however\r\n      plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the\r\n      external world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or\r\n      short the period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the\r\n      causes of the action may be—can we ever conceive either complete\r\n      freedom or complete necessity.\n(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the\r\n      influence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom in\r\n      space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him\r\n      and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My action seems to me\r\n      free; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every direction, I\r\n      see that I raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction\r\n      to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my\r\n      own body. I chose one out of all the possible directions because in it\r\n      there were fewest obstacles. For my action to be free it was necessary\r\n      that it should encounter no obstacles. To conceive of a man being free we\r\n      must imagine him outside space, which is evidently impossible.\n(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the\r\n      deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I examine an\r\n      action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not being free,\r\n      for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed. Can\r\n      I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself: could I have abstained from\r\n      lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed? To convince myself\r\n      of this I do not lift it the next moment. But I am not now abstaining from\r\n      doing so at the first moment when I asked the question. Time has gone by\r\n      which I could not detain, the arm I then lifted is no longer the same as\r\n      the arm I now refrain from lifting, nor is the air in which I lifted it\r\n      the same that now surrounds me. The moment in which the first movement was\r\n      made is irrevocable, and at that moment I could make only one movement,\r\n      and whatever movement I made would be the only one. That I did not lift my\r\n      arm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained from lifting\r\n      it then. And since I could make only one movement at that single moment of\r\n      time, it could not have been any other. To imagine it as free, it is\r\n      necessary to imagine it in the present, on the boundary between the past\r\n      and the future—that is, outside time, which is impossible.\n(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be\r\n      increased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is, an\r\n      absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the\r\n      expression of will in any action, our own or another’s, the first demand\r\n      of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a cause\r\n      no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action\r\n      independently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a\r\n      cause is the cause of my action.\nBut even if—imagining a man quite exempt from all influences,\r\n      examining only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any cause—we\r\n      were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled\r\n      zero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete\r\n      freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world, standing\r\n      outside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.\nIn the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of\r\n      freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.\n(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in\r\n      which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for the\r\n      number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And\r\n      therefore so long as notallthe conditions influencing men are defined,\r\n      there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom\r\n      remains.\n(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are\r\n      examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while time\r\n      is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute\r\n      inevitability.\n(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we\r\n      shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we\r\n      never reach absolute inevitability.\nBut besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to\r\n      equal zero, we assumed in some given case—as for instance in that of\r\n      a dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot—complete absence of\r\n      freedom, by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the\r\n      case we are examining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no\r\n      man. And so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the\r\n      law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible\r\n      as the conception of a man’s completely free action.\nAnd so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of\r\n      inevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of aninfinitenumber of space relations, aninfinitelylong\r\n      period of time, and aninfiniteseries of causes.\nTo imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of\r\n      inevitability, we must imagine him all alone,beyond space, beyond time,andfree from dependence on cause.\nIn the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom we\r\n      should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of\r\n      inevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.\nIn the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability we\r\n      should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and\r\n      cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be\r\n      nothing, or mere content without form.\nWe should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man’s whole\r\n      outlook on the universe is constructed—the incomprehensible essence\r\n      of life, and the laws defining that essence.\nReason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it\r\n      visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is\r\n      infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise. (3)\r\n      The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no\r\n      end.\nConsciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me,\r\n      consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed\r\n      moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living,\r\n      consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I feel myself\r\n      to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.\nReason gives expression to the laws of inevitability. Consciousness gives\r\n      expression to the essence of freedom.\nFreedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in man’s\r\n      consciousness. Inevitability without content is man’s reason in its three\r\n      forms.\nFreedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines. Freedom is\r\n      the content. Inevitability is the form.\nOnly by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one another as\r\n      form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and separately\r\n      incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.\nOnly by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man’s life.\nApart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one\r\n      another as form and content, no conception of life is possible.\nAll that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free\r\n      will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason.\nAll that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain\r\n      relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of\r\n      life to the laws of reason.\nThe great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them;\r\n      we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal force, and\r\n      so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that\r\n      freedom.\nBut just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but felt\r\n      by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the\r\n      laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first knowledge\r\n      that all bodies have weight, up to Newton’s law), so too the force of free\r\n      will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious, is\r\n      intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to\r\n      which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies, up to the\r\n      knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws).\nAll knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws\r\n      of reason.\nMan’s free will differs from every other force in that man is directly\r\n      conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any\r\n      other force. The forces of gravitation, electricity, or chemical affinity\r\n      are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently\r\n      defined by reason. Just so the force of man’s free will is distinguished\r\n      by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason\r\n      gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, that is, apart from the laws of\r\n      reason that define it, differs in no way from gravitation, or heat, or the\r\n      force that makes things grow; for reason, it is only a momentary\r\n      undefinable sensation of life.\nAnd as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies,\r\n      the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or of\r\n      chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of astronomy,\r\n      physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the same way does\r\n      the force of free will form the content of history. But just as the\r\n      subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of\r\n      life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics,\r\n      even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space,\r\n      in time, and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history, while\r\n      free will itself is the subject of metaphysics.\nIn the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of\r\n      inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is\r\n      only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know\r\n      of the essence of life.\nSo also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability, what\r\n      is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an expression\r\n      for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life."

    "text": "History examines the manifestations of man’s free will in connection with\r\n      the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it defines\r\n      this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science only in so\r\n      far as this free will is defined by those laws.\nThe recognition of man’s free will as something capable of influencing\r\n      historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for\r\n      history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies\r\n      would be for astronomy.\nThat assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws,\r\n      that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body moving\r\n      freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no conception\r\n      of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If any single\r\n      action is due to free will, then not a single historical law can exist,\r\n      nor any conception of historical events.\nFor history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end of which\r\n      is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of\r\n      man’s will in the present moves in space, time, and dependence on cause.\nThe more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more\r\n      evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define those laws\r\n      is the problem of history.\nFrom the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its\r\n      subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in man’s\r\n      free will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible, for\r\n      however man’s free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize it as a\r\n      force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes impossible.\nOnly by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that is,\r\n      by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince ourselves\r\n      of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then instead of seeking\r\n      causes, history will take the discovery of laws as its problem.\nThe search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of\r\n      thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with\r\n      the self-destruction toward which—ever dissecting and dissecting the\r\n      causes of phenomena—the old method of history is moving.\nAll human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at\r\n      infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the\r\n      process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of\r\n      unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception of cause,\r\n      mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all unknown,\r\n      infinitely small, elements.\nIn another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences\r\n      have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say\r\n      that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all\r\n      bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting\r\n      one another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the\r\n      movement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies\r\n      from the infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by the\r\n      natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they seek for laws.\r\n      History stands on the same path. And if history has for its object the\r\n      study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration\r\n      of episodes in the lives of individuals, it too, setting aside the\r\n      conception of cause, should seek the laws common to all the inseparably\r\n      interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will."

    "text": "From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the mere\r\n      recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves\r\n      sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients. By disproving\r\n      that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the\r\n      movements of the bodies, but without disproving it, it would seem\r\n      impossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after the\r\n      discovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still studied\r\n      for a long time.\nFrom the time the first person said and proved that the number of births\r\n      or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that mode\r\n      of government is determined by certain geographical and economic\r\n      conditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce\r\n      migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built\r\n      were destroyed in their essence.\nBy refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been\r\n      retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue\r\n      studying historic events as the results of man’s free will. For if a\r\n      certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of\r\n      peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic,\r\n      ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those\r\n      individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government\r\n      or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.\nAnd yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the\r\n      laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology,\r\n      and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.\nThe struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly\r\n      fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard for the old\r\n      views and accused the new of violating revelation. But when truth\r\n      conquered, theology established itself just as firmly on the new\r\n      foundation.\nJust as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between the\r\n      old and the new conception of history, and theology in the same way stands\r\n      on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of subverting\r\n      revelation.\nIn the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes\r\n      passion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret for\r\n      the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the other\r\n      is the passion for destruction.\nTo the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy, it\r\n      seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in God, in\r\n      the creation of the firmament, and in the miracle of Joshua the son of\r\n      Nun. To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to Voltaire\r\n      for example, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion, and\r\n      he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion.\nJust so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability,\r\n      to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil, and all the\r\n      institutions of state and church that have been built up on those\r\n      conceptions.\nSo too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of\r\n      inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though the\r\n      law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in astronomy,\r\n      far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation on which the\r\n      institutions of state and church are erected.\nAs in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of history now,\r\n      the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or\r\n      nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure of visible\r\n      phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth, in history\r\n      it is the independence of personality—free will.\nAs with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth\r\n      lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth’s fixity and of the\r\n      motion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing the\r\n      subjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause lies in\r\n      renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one’s own\r\n      personality. But as in astronomy the new view said: “It is true that we do\r\n      not feel the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility we\r\n      arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not feel)\r\n      we arrive at laws,” so also in history the new view says: “It is true that\r\n      we are not conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our free will we\r\n      arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on the external\r\n      world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws.”\nIn the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an\r\n      unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel; in\r\n      the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does\r\n      not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious."
